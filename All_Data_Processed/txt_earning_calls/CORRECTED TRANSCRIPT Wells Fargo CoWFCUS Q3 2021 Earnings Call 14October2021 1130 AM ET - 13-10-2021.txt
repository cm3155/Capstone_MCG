september occ enforcement action and for the first time since first quarter we grew both periodend loans and deposits in the third quarter we continue to see that our customers have significant liquidity and consumers are continuing to spend while lower than the peak in march our consumer customers median deposit balances continue to remain above pre pandemic levels up for customers who received federal stimulus and higher for those who did not receive federal aid weekly debit card spend during the third quarter was up every week compared to and in the week ending october 1st was up

credit performance continued to be strong now let me update you on the progress weve made on our strategic priorities first building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure has been and remains wells fargos top priority we reached a significant milestone with the termination of the cfpb consent order issued in september regarding improper retail sales practices its expiration reflects years of hard work by employees across wells fargo intended to ensure that the conduct at the core of the cfpb order will not recur as a reminder this is the second important regulatory milestone we achieved this year with the occ terminating a consent order related to our bsaaml compliance program in january but the recent occ actions are a reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when i arrived must remain our top priority i believe were making meaningful progress and i remain confident in our ability to close the remaining gaps over the next several years wells fargo co wfc

entrepreneurial center to empower womenowned businesses we committed to invest million through the neighborhoodlift program to help more than low and moderateincome residents in philadelphia with home

there certainly risks that remain including the latest wave of covid infections the recent us fiscal policy stalemate and inflation concerns the outlook for the economy is promising consumers financial condition remains strong with leverage at its lowest level in years and the debt burden below its long term average companies are also strong as well we remain on target to achieve a sustainable rotce subject to the same assumptions we discussed in the past on a run rate basis at some point next year and well then discuss our plan to continue to increase returns i want to thank our employees for continuing to work hard to make wells fargo better for our customers shareholders and communities i will now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co thanks charlie and good morning everyone charlie summarized how were helping our customers and communities on slide so im going to start with our third quarter financial results on slide net income for the quarter was billion or per common share our results included a billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses this is reflective of the continuing improvement in credit performance and the economic recovery pretax preprovision profit grew from a year ago as lower revenue driven by decline in net interest income was more than offset by lower expenses we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives which has helped improve the expense run rate and as charlie highlighted the third quarter included million in operating losses associated with the september occ enforcement action noninterest income was relatively stable from a year ago within that equity gains declined from the second quarter but increased million from a year ago predominantly due to our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses we also had an increase in investment advisory and other assetbased fees from a year ago as well as in card depositrelated and investment banking fees these increases were more than offset by declines in other areas including lower mortgage banking revenue and lower markets revenue in corporate and investment banking our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was our cet1 ratio declined to in the third quarter as we repurchased billion of common stock as a reminder our regulatory minimum will be in the first quarter of reflecting a lower gsib capital surcharge additionally under the stress capital buffer framework we have flexibility to increase capital distributions and if possible we will be able to repurchase more wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 than the billion included in our capital plan over the fourquarter period depending on market conditions and other risk factors including covidrelated risks turning to credit quality on slide our net loan chargeoff ratio was basis points in the quarter commercial credit performance continued to improve and net loan chargeoffs declined million from the second quarter to basis points the improvement was broadbased and included modest net recoveries in our energy portfolio and in commercial real estate the commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well the recovery in retail and hotel properties reflected increased liquidity and improved valuations while we have not seen any widespread stress in office we continue to watch this sector closely and believe that any impact as a result of returntooffice or hybrid working plans will take time to play out consumer credit performance also continued to improve with strong collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remaining above prepandemic levels net loan chargeoffs declined million from the second quarter to basis points we continue to have net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios and losses in both credit card and auto declined nonperforming assets declined million or from the second quarter driven by lower commercial nonaccruals with clients across all asset types energy was the largest driver given significant improvement in fundamentals on the back of higher commodity prices our allowance level at the end of the third quarter reflected continued strong credit performance the continuing economic recovery and the uncertainties that still remain if current economic trends continue we would expect to have additional reserve releases on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans were relatively stable from the second quarter with a decline in residential mortgage loans largely offset by modest growth in most of our consumer and commercial portfolios total periodend loans grew for the first time since the first quarter of and were up billion from the second quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans auto other consumer credit card and commercial real estate average deposits increased billion or from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap turning to net interest income on slide net interest income grew million or from the second quarter and was down million or from a year ago the decrease from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances and the impact of lower yields on earning assets partially offset by a decline in longterm debt and lower premium amortization on our mortgagebacked securities we had billion of loans we purchased out of mortgagebacked securities or epbos at the end of the third quarter down billion from the second quarter these loans do contribute to net interest income and we expect these epbo loan balances to decline substantially by the end of at the end of the third quarter we also had billion of ppp loans outstanding and we expect the balances to steadily decline over the next several quarters and to be under billion by the end of next year we continue to expect net interest income to be near the bottom of our initial guidance range of flat to down from the annualized fourth quarter level of billion for the full year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago the decrease was driven by lower restructuring charges and operating losses and the progress weve made on our efficiency initiatives during the first nine months of this year these initiatives have helped to drive a decline in professional and outside services expense by reducing our spend on consultants and contractors an reduction in occupancy costs by reducing the number of locations including branches and offices occupancy costs have also declined from lower covid19related costs and a decline in salaries expense by eliminating management layers and increasing expansion controls across the organization and optimizing branch staffing now let me provide some specific examples of progress were making on some of the initiatives we are continuing to work on reducing the underlying costs to run our consumer banking business the pandemic accelerated customer migration to digital which continue with mobile logons up in the third quarter from a year ago while teller transactions were flat from a year ago they were over lower than prepandemic levels as transactions have migrated to atms and mobile over the past year weve reduced our number of branches by or and lowered head count in branch banking by we continue to focus on generating efficiencies in our branches and have a number of initiatives designed to further reduce expenses including reducing cash handling time and simplifying certain branch processes wealth and investment management has had strong increases in revenuerelated compensation however by executing on efficiency initiatives nonrevenuerelated expenses in the third quarter declined from a year ago and nonadvisor head count was down from a year ago we have aligned our wealth management business under eight divisional leaders creating better coordination and efficiency we have also implemented a more efficient client service model across all distribution channels and have reduced total square footage by rationalizing our real estate footprint corporate and investment banking has continued to make progress on various efficiency initiatives these efforts include reducing head count supporting products regions or sectors with low levels of market activity and opportunity optimizing operations and support teams vendor optimization and insourcing and reducing spend on contractors and consultants were also working on initiatives in centralized functions including operations where we have realized savings from location optimization lower thirdparty spending by eliminating consulting arrangements and consolidating vendors the operations group has also reduced ph spends on layers with savings coming from eliminating manager roles automation efforts and strategy enhancements have driven process improvements while reducing costs in many areas including fraud management and card collections weve also been working on additional opportunities through technology enablement that have longer lead times but should result in benefits that we expect will reduce operationsrelated expenses over time with three quarters of actual results already our current outlook for expenses excluding restructuring charges and the cost of business exits is approximately billion note that we had million of restructuring charges and cost of business exits during the first nine months of the year this outlook includes an expectation of higher operating losses and higher revenuerelated expenses than we assumed earlier in the year our expense outlook also assumes a full year of expenses related to wells fargo asset management and our corporate trust services business and we expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter we will update you on the expense impact of these initiatives after they close wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 as mentioned the outlook accounts for the fact that we expect full year operating losses to be approximately million higher than our assumptions at the beginning of the year this includes approximately billion of operating losses incurred during the first nine months of the year and our outlook assumes million of operating losses in the fourth quarter just a reminder that operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable especially as we continue to address the significant work needed to satisfy our regulatory requirements our current outlook also assumes revenuerelated compensation will be approximately billion this year which is higher than the million we assumed at the beginning of the year strong equity markets have driven revenuerelated expenses which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in expenses now turning to our business segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago primarily due to an increase in consumer activity including higher debit card transactions and lower covidrelated fee waivers home lending revenue declined from a year ago primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower gain on sale margins origination volumes and servicing fees net interest income also declined driven by lower loan balances these declines were partially offset by higher gains from the resecuritization of loans we purchased from mortgagebacked securities last year credit card revenue was up from a year ago driven by increased spending and lower customer accommodations and fee waivers in response to the pandemic auto revenue increased from a year ago on higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide our mortgage originations declined from the second quarter with corresponding originations growing which was more than offset by a decline in retail we currently expect our fourth quarter originations to decline modestly given the recent increase in mortgage rates and the typical seasonal trends in the purchase market despite strong consumer demand for autos inventory shortages are putting downward pressure on industry sales and driving higher prices the competitive environment has remained relatively stable and weve had our second consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up from a year ago turning to debit cards transactions were relatively stable from the second quarter and up from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories we had strong growth in new credit card accounts up from the second quarter driven by the launch of our new active cash card credit card pointofsale purchase volume was up from a year ago and from the second quarter while payment rates remain high average balances grew from the second quarter the first time balances have grown since the fourth quarter of turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue declined from a year ago primarily due to lower loan balances and lower interest rates which were partially offset by higher deposit balances and depositrelated fees assetbased lending and leasing revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and lower lease income noninterest expense declined from a year ago primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense due to efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense after declining for four consecutive quarters average loans stabilized in the third quarter line utilizations remain low and loan demand continue to be impacted by low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions however there was some increase in demand late in the quarter and periodend balances increased billion or from the second quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 turning to corporate and investment banking on slide in banking total revenue increased from a year ago this growth was driven by higher advisory and equity origination fees and an increase in loan balances partially offset by lower deposit balances predominately due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by higher commercial servicing income loan balances and capital markets results on stronger commercial gain on sale volumes and margins and higher underwriting fees markets revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower trading activity across most asset classes primarily due to market conditions noninterest expense declined from a year ago primarily driven by reduced operations expense due to efficiency initiatives wealth and investment management revenue on slide grew from a year ago a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates was more than offset by higher assetbased fees primarily due to higher market valuations revenuerelated compensation drove the increase in noninterest expense from a year ago i highlighted earlier the progress weve made on efficiency initiatives to reduce nonrevenuerelated expenses including salaries and occupancy expense client assets increased from a year ago primarily driven by higher market valuations average deposits were up from a year ago and average loans increased from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securitiesbased lending and then slide highlights our corporate results revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower net interest income primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and lower noninterest income due to lower gains on the sale of securities in our investment portfolio the decline in revenue from the second quarter was primarily driven by lower equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and expenses included the million operating loss associated with the occ enforcement action in september with that we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning thanks for taking the question i guess i was hoping you could sort of address the cost outlook i certainly appreciate the commentary regarding the fourth quarter in particular and i think as we look forward you guys have had the expectation that costs could come down yearoveryear for the next couple of years i mean that of course puts you guys in a very unique position visàvis many of your peers but so many people are talking about things like wage inflation right now just curious to what degree are you seeing that and more importantly is there enough flexibility in your existing outlook sets that even despite higher wage pressures you could still see costs down yearoveryear for the next couple of years charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure this is charlie thanks for the question i guess let me start with the wage inflation i think we certainly are seeing wage inflation i would say its very different across different parts of the company and very different across different job categories that we have and so as we approach it were trying to be very thoughtful about ensuring that were continuing to be as fair with people as we can be as well as paying competitively we actually are making awards to people in our branches which equate to roughly an hour from the beginning of october through the end of the year to thank them for what theyre doing but also address the competitiveness that exists out there and were evaluating what makes sense for the longerterm and in places in the company where we do see wage pressure were acting accordingly but i would not say that its something that we see everywhere across the entire company in every single job but were certainly prepared for it and look at it very very regularly as we look at things like attrition and whatnot to the broader question i think well first of all were in the middle of doing our budgets now as im sure you hear from everyone when they do these calls at this time of year our goal is still the same that weve said in the past which is we still would like to see net reductions in the overall expense base we are in a unique position in that i would say in two ways first of all we do have the significant amount that were spending on regulatory orders and were not assuming that we get efficiencies out of that in the near future but one day when weve built all thats required that will be an opportunity for us but thats not even on the radar screen for us right now but we still have just tremendous excess expenses across the company you can see it in head count you can see it in efficiency ratios across the businesses and what i found here is the same thing i think that mike and i have seen at a lot of other places which is its like peeling an onion back you think you see whats incredibly clear once you actually get rid of those inefficiencies you then start to see the next level and it becomes part of the culture and we engage the entire company in moving that way wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 so we still think that there are extremely meaningful efficiencies that we can pursue for quite some time here which hopefully will both allow us to have net reductions but also invest appropriately whether its in technology or products which as weve said were extremely focused on as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you very much and then i was hoping mike you might be able to expand on a comment you made about loan demand improving later in the quarter there seems to be a little bit of a divergence emerging between the kind of demand were seeing at say smaller and middlemarket companies for instance versus what were seeing with larger corporates that might have better access to the capital markets curious if you can just provide a little more color where youre seeing that improved demand please michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and i assume we will see some divergence across different some of the peers as you sort of look at this but if you look at the commercial bank as an example were actually seeing the demand in the pipeline build in kind of the middle and upper end of the client base with a little bit less of demand emerging so far on lower end which i know is counter to what you the way you asked the question but i think thats what were seeing right now and i think in part thats because the clients in the lower end of our client base still have a lot of excess liquidity and theyre still dealing with supply chain crunches and other issues that are sort of impacting their need for liquidity need for credit and i think that well start to see more demand i think more consistently across the client base over time as things play out but thats what were seeing in the commercial bank i think when you look more broadly and you look at the consumer side we have seen balances grow in auto weve seen them in card when you look through the home lending data that we give you we are seeing growth on our kind of core nonconforming mortgage book as well thats offset by the declines in the loans that we bought out from securities last year but we are seeing some growth there too and then you see some growth in the corporate and investment bank and thats really a little bit of a lot of things happening across the corporate and investment bank whether its real estate subscription finance and other sectors that are really driving some of that growth and so again its still relatively modest so far in terms of what weve seen and i think itll take some more time for it to really play out in a more meaningful way but its encouraging to start to see at least a little bit manifest so far charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and i would just encourage you to make sure that you look at the periodend balances as well as the averages because it certainly gets to the heart of the question and then just one final thing ill say on this which is were not stretching in any way in terms of credit or pricing or things like that to try and get to a result were continuing to have the same disciplines that weve always had and its going to be a question of our balances are rising because of greater customer activity r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thats terrific thank you guys very much wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 operator the next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys thanks good morning just wondering mike if you could just talk a little bit about just some of the ins and outs on underneath nii outside from balance sheet movements meaning you saw little bit of increase in premium am can you just remind us like how that mechanism works in terms of what rates need to do to have a ongoing improvement there and are you at the point or how close are you to the point where your incremental purchases or replacements on the securities book are getting closer to whats rolling off thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah thanks ken i think when you think about premium amortization i think you said it backwards but like were getting a benefit from premium amortization coming down in the quarter and you saw that in our results as roughly million a little bit or maybe a couple bucks less and so as weve been saying we expect that to continue to come down i think itll be somewhat gradual as we look at the next couple of quarters youre not going to see big stepdowns i think itll come down again in the fourth quarter maybe a little less than we saw from the second to the third quarter and as rates as youve seen over the last three months rates have been a little all over the place and so its a bit of a function of where mortgage rates are and theres a little bit of a lag to it as it comes through the data but we still expect the general trajectory to be coming down on premium amortization its just a matter of exactly how fast and over what time period thatll happen i think on the second part of the question what was the second part again ken the ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc just about reinvestment rates versus the underlying portfolio on the securities book michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no and again even on that i keep reminding people as you sort of look at the third quarter and rates were much much lower than they are today for most of the second quarter and so really weve seen them rally at the tail end of the quarter and kind of stabilize to come down slightly since then over the last week or so and so that gap is closing obviously in terms of whats rolling off and getting closer to kind of the overall average in the portfolio but we still have a little ways to go for reinvestment rates to match sort of whats rolling out of the portfolio ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and just last quick one just longterm debt youve been meaningfully reducing the footprint and helped by the mix improving on the balance sheet how much more of an opportunity is that to continue to lower the longterm debt footprint and reduce the cost of it thanks mike wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah yeah no its a good question and i think our constraints going to be tlac how much tlac we have to hold and i think you can probably model that out a little bit so we have a little bit more room to go to continue to optimize the mix here and bring the longterm debt down but its likely at some point next year thatll start to change operator the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so wanted to ask a follow up on kens last line of questioning around the nii outlook and if i take all the different component pieces that you mentioned and just throw it in the blender so more constructive loan growth commentary some modest but steady premium am benefit but still some reinvestment headwinds is it reasonable to expect that you can grow nii versus the lower end of the guidance range for and separately whats your appetite to deploy excess liquidity just given your excess reserves parked at the fed at least as a percentage of the overall balance sheet is still quite elevated relative to many of your peers michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah maybe ill start with the second one and ill come back to the first part steve as we think about redeployment were still being pretty patient and as i just mentioned to kens question you look at whats been happening over the last few months rates were much lower they rallied recently at the same time the basis between treasuries and mortgages has actually compressed a bit so it made them a little bit relatively more expensive and if you look at whats happening in inflation and with tapering coming we still think that there is more risk to upside on rates than there is downside at this point and so were still being patient as we sort of look at our redeployment there and when opportunities present themselves well take advantage of them and we did that a little bit right at the end of the third quarter where we accelerated some purchases that we were making given the spike and the rally that we saw there and so well continue to do that but were going to be patient as we see how would things develop over the coming months as you sort of think about the range for the full year weve been giving a range for a reason right because theres a lot of moving pieces right and theres still a few months to play out and i think if we obviously see faster loan growth than we expect that will be a positive but if we see rates move a little bit higher than what the forward curve has that will be positive we still have to just to keep up with where the securities portfolio we have a lot of purchases to make in the fourth quarter and so where rates end up throughout will be important and then on the margin theres things like ppp and other factors that sort of drive that and that will be determined based on the client forgiveness trends that we see in our client base so i think there are scenarios where we could be a little bit better than what we projected there and theres some scenarios where we could be a little bit worse depending on how all those factors play out steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 thats great color thanks for taking my question operator thank you the next question will come from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi i wanted to follow up on the expenses when we think about the aspiration for expenses to be down next year and understanding that youre going through budgeting and thats a goal right now mike can we think of it is thats your goal kind of relative to the billion and wouldnt include help from the business exits michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah john no i think we think about the business exits just separate from the core efficiency were driving and for lack of a better way to describe it if we think that theres going to be a savings of x dollars as these businesses roll off take the billion and subtract the x and that will be our new goal charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co a new starting place michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co a new starting place yeah and we gave you at a high level some detail about that in april and when these close and weve got good clarity on it well be very transparent about how to reset the baseline and the starting point john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research sure and in terms of you expect some gains on sales i assume those are youre thinking the same lines and those should probably come in the fourth quarter is what youre currently thinking michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah they may not all be in the fourth quarter given how the deals were structured like not of the gains will be in the fourth quarter but a good chunk of it will be in the fourth quarter and obviously well be clear on what that was when it happens john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and the last thing from me is if we want to dream about loan growth coming back to the industry how do we think about how much capacity you have to grow loans while staying under the asset cap and where does that come from does it come from cash liquidity mix and moving other stuff around the balance sheet can you just give us some thoughts on that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah we all dream of faster loan growth so i think were aligned there look i think weve got plenty of room to grow on the loan side and whether it comes initially from cash thats sitting at the fed that would be kind of the first place but if we needed to we could reduce the securities portfolio as well if it grew much faster than what we expected that would be a nice problem to have but at this point we have plenty of capacity to grow john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks operator thank you the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just one big picture question charlie appreciate you mentioning the risk of setbacks as you go through the whole regulatory process at the same time when we talk to investors i think theres indiscernible the longer you steer within that asset cap i was wondering if you could address just in terms of when we think about the franchise both from a talent and client standpoint how worried should your shareholders be about that or do you think thats well taken care of charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well i think its i would say i do think its well taking care of ill start there but i think we think about it every day that we take actions to stay below the cap i think as mike just spoke about we have significant room on the asset side of the balance sheet which is where you really want to be there for clients where they need you and so when youre out hustling for business were certainly able to fulfill their needs doesnt matter whether its consumer or whether its corporate our experience has been that we continue to find ways to optimize the balance sheet in a way that has very little client impact and where we have to move deposits off the balance sheet we work with customers to come up with other offbalancesheet solutions for them and i think our experience has been that customers are very very understanding of what that is so again i think as we think about and by the way we have not limited the growth of deposits on the consumer side at all so when we think about there were longterm impacts i think we certainly would have liked to have been in a different position if we had a choice but were trying to be very smart about having as little franchise impact as possible when we make these decisions and make sure were communicating with customers and i think the people here at wells have done an amazing job of striking that right balance and as i said i think were as open for business as anyone on the asset side and i think customers appreciate that as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it no thanks for sharing that perspective and just one quick one mike on the nii when we look at the fourth quarter on your fullyear guidance does the netnet of all of that imply that fourth quarter nii should at least grow from third quarter levels and can you disclose what the ppp impact was for the third quarter nii number wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah i think on the fourth quarter you can model like based on what your assumptions are right and as i said well be sort of near the bottom of the range and you can sort of pick where you think well be based on how you feel about it i think for third quarter the ppp impact was about million and just to give you a little context that was a little bit lower than what we saw in the second quarter and we would expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit lower than that potentially but thatll all be based on how clients the pace of forgiveness requests that we get from clients but overall a pretty small sequential impact and thats all baked into our forecast ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you operator thank you the next question comes from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the expense side how should we think about the timing and the magnitude of the remaining billion in cost saves and would you say that any of the latest regulatory developments impacted how youre thinking about the magnitude or the timing of the realization of those saves thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah john its mike as we said in the beginning of the year we were going to get about billion of the billion this year and the annualized impact starts to build as you go through the year so some of that you get in the run rate coming out of and some of that will take more time to get at and as i mentioned where we have to introduce new technology or other new capabilities it just takes longer to get at some of it and as we sort of said at the beginning of the year this is a multiyear plan so were not going to get all of that in the first months by any stretch and as we get to january well give you a better view of what to expect on john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it and then separately on the loan front can you just maybe give us a little more detail on the trends youre seeing in the card business including spending volume as well as payment rates and then separately any thoughts on the impact of the buy now pay later product on how youre thinking about your product set thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah i think when you look at payment rates theyre still really high like they bounce around little bit monthto month in the last quarter or so but theyre still really high and so what youre getting when you look at the balance growth youre seeing youre really getting that through an increase in the pointofsale purchase volumes that are coming through charlie highlighted a bunch of stats based on what were seeing in the book but id say overall spend patterns spend is still pretty strong pretty stable from where we saw in the second quarter up versus the comparable wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 period last year or in and as youd expect in any given week or month or quarter the different categories move around quite a bit depending on whats happening based on that time period and then i think when you look at so you can see that pointofsale volumes are up from the quarter a year ago sequentially and you can see the new account growth which is up quite a bit from a year ago and from the second quarter based on the new products weve launched so id characterize it as still really strong activity levels despite the noise you see out there related to the delta variant and other things charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co this is charlie on buy now pay later i would say i would describe buy now pay later as another option of providing credit and serving the merchant i think as others have said its still overall a relatively small portion of the market but i think therell be a place for it but its not going to supplant all the other types of credit that exist out there we have our own retail services business we have our own personal lending business and weve got a significant number of merchant relationships ourselves so its a place that we will be in addition to the products that we have and over time my guess is it will continue youre seeing a proliferation of people involved now at some time at some point it will become far more consolidated for all the reasons that these other industries have been consolidated including those that can really provide a differentiated experience for the merchant so hopefully that helps john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah it does thanks charlie appreciate it operator thank you the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys charlie i wanted to follow up again on the comment about likely to have additional setbacks from the regulatory stuff and just to push here for a little bit if you dont mind is this kind of like a broad risk statement just in case like you never know or should we just be prepared for something more meaningful whether its a speed bump or a potential landmine between here and specifically the end of the asset cap which i think everyone views as the key turning point charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i guess i would describe it this way everyone focuses on the asset cap and i understand all the reasons for that for sure and i think just whats important to us is that we want to make sure that theres complete transparency which we believe we have if you read our 10q but also we want to make sure that youre just thinking about the broad set of things that were dealing with and the reality is the asset cap embedded in the said consent order is one very important order but we still have other consent orders with other agencies which are still extraordinarily important we have other inquiries that are in progress that are described in there and so i just think its important that were completely transparent its nothing different than what weve been saying and when you talk about speed bump versus landmines hopefully wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 we all work to make sure that we minimize the likelihood of a landmine but as i said before the intricateness on just on the pure amount of things that we have to do are complex were judged on practices that were in place years ago as well as practices that are in place today and were judged based upon the overall progress based upon the initial due dates of some of these things and so nothing changes my perspective about netnet are we moving forward i absolutely believe we are and were able to see all the internal metrics every interim date and things like that which the outsiders cant see but we choose our words very carefully on things like that and so i just want to make sure that people understand that we have these things that are out there and dont want you to be surprised if something happens but it doesnt change our point of view of what the opportunity is and how confident we are about being able to close these things matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and as a followup i know you cant tell us what the conversation kind of content is with the regulators but can you at least tell us like do you have like the point of conversation like on the asset cap we submitted the plan you accepted it like how long is this going to take we all just from the outside try to understand like what the level of communication is because i think on some fronts theres a lot of communication like the occ i think sits in all the banks offices so theres a lot of regular communication there but with the fed and the asset cap its kind of like is there any conversation about it even if you cant tell us specifically what it is charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so a couple things first of all we have and i think this is not just us i think this is true of all banks we have regular conversations with all of our regulators absolutely with the occ as you say there are many examiners in our offices on a regular basis but we have an extremely open and interactive relationship with the cfpb with the fed with the fdic and all other appropriate regulators including the sec finra overseas regulators and that is the way we treat the relationships i have found the fed to be clear consistent in their approach to issues that relate to supervision i think thats just a general comment that i would say i havent seen things deviate from that and as ive said when i look at the consent order it doesnt say submit a plan and then well talk about lifting the asset cap it describes in there what we have to do and so you should just assume that there is we have a constant level of engagement that were really clear on what we have to do and were doing the work to get there matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful color thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you mike can you share with us your credit quality is very strong similar to many in the industry your net chargeoff ratio of course was an incredibly low basis points do have an idea how long you could kind of sustain such a strong level of net chargeoffs and when it may reach a more normalized level some time looking wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 out and then second your reserves relative to loans i think were about basis points and when we go back to that day one cecl number that you guys put out in january of it was about basis points and that difference youre about the widest of all your peers so any thoughts on just where the reserve could go as well thank you michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah thanks gerard a couple of things i think so far weve all in the industry been wrong about when credit or how credit will normalize and at some point i think we all expect that were going to get back to more normal chargeoff rates now having said that the new normal might be different if people keep higher sustain higher liquidity balances throughout time so i think thats something to still play out i think at this point as charlie highlighted in his script people still have high liquidity balances were seeing high payoff rates in credit cards and other loans and so theres no reason to think that we shouldnt continue to have strong credit performance in the near term it may not be basis points but it should still be historically quite strong at least in the near term and well see how it starts to normalize i think as it go ahead charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co just let me add one thing on that i just think that when we think about longterm earnings power of the company and we talk about our ability to get sustainable return numbers we assume that the chargeoff number will go up from there so we agree its extremely low that it wont stay here and just as you think about when we think about our returns we make adjustments for that and so if they do start to rise next year then itll be hopefully in our assumptions and if not then well get there sooner maybe but well explain why michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and as it relates to the coverage ratio today as weve said for the last couple of quarters we continue to be reserved for a whole number of different scenarios and it hopefully will prove out to be very conservative relative to what plays out over the coming quarters and if we continue to see trends continue well have more releases as we go i think whether you get back to day one cecl levels or not i think is a really almost impossible question to answer given its going to be a function of all the variables you now have to consider and what your outlook is what the different risks are at that time and if you go back to first quarter of i think we had what unemployment at that point and it was a very well i think precovid it was a very kind of utopian environment i think from an economic perspective and so will we get back to exactly that outlook hard to say but i think we continue to think if things play out well have more releases and that number will go down gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup can you give us an update in the middle market investment banking initiatives how successful have you guys been in penetrating your existing customer base wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look as we highlighted gerard we think thats a really big opportunity over a long period of time but it doesnt happen in a quarter or two it takes some time to really make sure that weve got those relationships built out in the way we want we really started to put some extra focus on it in a very disciplined way late last year so id say were still early i think were seeing some encouraging green shoots where weve had some opportunities that weve won over the last few months or couple of quarters that we might not have been in a position to have before that but itll take some time to play out but we do think the opportunity is pretty big gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you very much operator thank you the next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi how are you doing charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one on the branch network just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you see your footprint today and is there more of an opportunity to expand or to optimize charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thats a good question betsy i think were actually doing a bunch of work on exactly what that looks like because we have been very very focused on net reductions given the fact that we were behind some others and so the team has done a great work in just terms of identifying well describe them as just we had a significant number of very obvious consolidation opportunities theyre really not closures theyre really consolidation where we have the appropriate local coverage i think the work that were doing is to really think through at this point where we have significant share where we have less share but we have enough concentration what our footprint looks like in some of those places to figure out how we can actually reorient the existing number of branches that we have over a period of time so i think the reality is we will continue to optimize because as time goes on we will continue to need less were focused on not leaving communities that need our help without solutions were going to certainly wind up with smaller footprints in a lot of the places because branch usage is changing but we will use that as an opportunity to figure out how to redeploy some of those resources as well wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then i have the same question on your wealth platform i know you recently brought in barry to run that and just want to understand the strategy there if you dont mind charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure i think weve got the strategy falls into kind of four distinct buckets number one is we have our think of it as our independent broker channel where its the old ag edwards and businesses like that wheat first that came together to form that network we have then financial advisors that work extremely closely with our bank branches and believe thats still a relatively untapped opportunity for us we also have a platform where brokers can actually go in when i say independent that was a wrong phrase in the beginning those are people who are employees but we have a platform where people can actually go independent and continue to do the business through us and then we have our online business wellstrade and so weve got those distinct different points of distribution and were focused equally on maximizing the value that existed in all of those historically i think we ran it much more as just one big opportunity and i think we feel like we have underinvested in the online piece and the independent piece for sure and the bank branch piece is something which we think is as i said just a very meaningful opportunity given the amount of affluent customers that we have in our branch footprint betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks betsy operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi charlie kind of go back to the regulatory consent orders just want to get a sense from you given the setback we had this quarter with the additional consent order youve obviously spent a lot on these youve hired youve brought in a lot of folks already since youve been there over the last two years a lot of consultants a lot of in house people so what do you need to do differently especially you as a management team to not have more of those setbacks and to have it go in the direction you were hoping it would go with this charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i would say vivek theres nothing new that we have to do as far as reaching an endpoint so if you said preconsent order or postconsent order does it change we have to do to build out the right capabilities with the right controls in this case in mortgage the answer is absolutely not and so again whether or not its being wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 done fast enough in the regulators minds relative to how long some of these things have been going on which predate many of us thats the context which they need to look at this in because thats who they regulate and how they have regulated so again i think for us and im not minimizing a consent order a consent order is a very big deal but the work thats embedded in there the end state is the same end state that we would have contemplated building ourselves and so theres a lot more formality thats part of the process now and the occ will be more deeply involved in the series of the checkpoints and things like that and there certainly is some more work that comes out of an exercise like that but the end state is the same vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and so when you say several years charlie either should we be thinking of that in terms of is it a threeyear timeframe is it a fiveyear timeframe just youre right weve all been dealing with this before you got there so it has already been fiveplus years so any sense of direction there charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i dont want to again in a perfect world wed lay out all of our plans for everyone but were obviously not in a position to do that and i think what i would just encourage you to do is look at the things that weve closed hopefully youll continue to see progress as we look forward and youll be able to draw judgments based upon that and relative to what it means for our business as i said we still have a fair amount of flexibility in order for us to grow feebased businesses and grow businesses that require balance sheet usage on the asset side i cant give you any more specificity other than we dont want to mislead people and its not as if were not thinking about the future and so again we try and be very careful not to weigh too much on one side or the other but weve got a lot of people here that serve customers every day and every single person isnt working on a consent order many are weve got a huge amount of resources that are dedicated to it but as you see were building products in the card business were building products in our retail services business were doing the same across the digital platforms across the company and as we execute on these items you build the confidence of the regulators so its not as if you have to wait until everything is completely done to be able to continue to move forward not just with your confidence but with their confidence as well and so hopefully in terms of the progress that we believe were making thats what were seeing and so youll see us put all the resources towards these things to minimize the timeframe but get them done properly at the same time that were moving the business forward vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks operator at this time we have no further questions and id like to turn the call back over to management charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 great well listen thank you
