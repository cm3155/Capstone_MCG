island thanks kristin good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today were pleased to get off to a good start to as our business model continues to demonstrate strength diversification and resilience notwithstanding continuing impacts from the pandemic we continue to focus on taking good care of customers highlighted by billion of ppp loans in the latest round of the program weve kept our colleagues safe and productive and we continue to drive benefits to our communities through various grants and strong levels of volunteerism our strategic initiatives remain on track and will lead to increasing differentiation and growth in franchise value versus peers over time our financial headlines are terrific though theyre flattered by a large reserve release given the improved economic outlook we delivered underlying q1 eps of an rotce of while our cet1 ratio grew to and our liquidity remains elevated with an quarterend loantodeposit ratio the first half of the year can be thought of as a transition period for us in terms of ppnr as the record levels of mortgage revenues normalize while we are still seeing strong levels of originations both refi and purchase elevated margins have been returning to historical levels as industry capacity has expanded and competition has intensified citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 we currently expect mortgage revenues broadly to bottom in q2 and then stabilize in the second half during the first quarter we saw strength in capital markets and wealth fees which partially offset the drop in mortgage fees this should continue into q2 and we should start to see loan growth pick up as well which provides a further offset the outlook for the second half ppnr is strengthening as we expect loan growth plus a stabilized nim given the steeper curve to help deliver top line growth this combined with strong pullthrough of our top benefits and overall expense discipline should result in healthy levels of positive operating leverage in q3 q4 and the second half along with return to solid ppnr growth the outlook for credit also continues to brighten with a negative provision of million in the first quarter our acl ratio ex ppp loans is now this compares with our day one acl upon cecl adoption of so theres likely still more to go on reserve releasing assuming the economic outlook continues to firm and clarify all of our credit trends continue to be favorable both on the consumer and commercial side weve moved our chargeoff guidance for fullyear to to basis points from the initial guidance of to basis points so to sum up we feel were off to a great start the economic outlook continues to improve and we are executing well on the initiatives that will position us over time as a topperforming bank with that ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone let me start with the headlines for the quarter we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was which includes the impact of a sizable reserve release revenue of billion was broadly stable yearoveryear strong fee income offsetting the impact of the low rate environment on nii highlights include continued strength in capital markets record results in wealth and wellcontrolled expenses we recorded a negative provision for credit losses of million which reflects strong credit performance with lower chargeoffs an improving loan portfolio profile and an improving macroeconomic outlook with our acl ratio now at excluding ppp loans and finally we are in a very strong capital position with cet1 at after returning million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter we also continued to grow our tangible book value per share which was at quarterend up compared with a year ago next ill refer to a few of the slides and give you some key takeaways for the first quarter ill then outline our outlook for the second quarter and provide some comments on net interest income on slide was down linked quarter given lower day count loan balances were broadly stable and net interest margin was up slightly the net interest margin improvement reflects a steepening yield curve and continued discipline on deposit pricing interestbearing deposit costs are down basis points to basis points which more than offset the impact of lower asset yields we expect that elevated deposit levels from recent stimulus will continue to impact margin in the nearterm we will continue to be proactive in pricing down deposits and pursuing attractive loan growth opportunities in areas like pointofsale finance and education as well as in attractive commercial segments the steepening of the curve provided us with the opportunity to begin adding to our hedge positions to moderate our asset sensitivity we added billion of fiveyear receivefixed cash flow swaps and terminated some pay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 fixed swaps during the course of the quarter those actions combined with expected balance sheet changes reduced our asset sensitivity to about from at the end of the year referring to slide we delivered solid fee results again this quarter reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in and diversify our revenue streams as expected mortgage fees were down approximately this quarter despite strong volumes as heightened competition and increased industry capacity pressured gain on sale margins nonetheless mortgage fees were still strong compared to a year ago and we expect a continued strong level of originations across all channels over as the market shifts to be more balanced between refi and purchase activities is expected to be the strongest home purchase market in history only restrained by housing inventory wealth fees were a record up linked quarter reflecting an increase in aum from net inflows and strong market levels with record sales capital markets fees remained robust though they were down from a record level in the fourth quarter with lower ma advisory fees partly offset by increased underwriting revenue foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue decreased million linked quarter given reduced client hedging as a result of less lending activity and lower volatility expenses on slide were wellcontrolled up linked quarter driven by seasonality in salaries and employee benefits we are continuing to focus on both the transformational and businessasusual aspects of our top program and we are on track to deliver total pretax run rate benefit of million to million by the end of average loans on slide were broadly stable linked quarter as commercial payoffs and slightly lower line utilization of about compared with our historical average of roughly was partially offset by growth in our education mortgage and pointofsale finance portfolios looking at yearoveryear trends average loans were up approximately due to ppp education and mortgage we executed the ppp lending program very smoothly with billion of loans secured as part of round two taking the total ppp loans to billion at periodend we expect that about of the round one loans will be forgiven by the end of the year and for round two which are fiveyear loans about could be forgiven by the end of and about forgiven after two years overall the ppp program will help stabilize nii in the first half of the year while the benefit will taper off a little in the second half on slide deposit flows benefited from the recent consumeroriented stimulus especially in lowcost categories and our liquidity ratios remain strong average deposits were up linked quarter and year overyear as consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and commercial clients built liquidity we are very pleased with our progress on deposit repricing with total deposit costs down basis points to basis points and interestbearing deposit costs down basis points to basis points during the quarter we continue to drive a shift towards lower cost categories with dda now about of average deposits compared with only a year ago the strength of our deposit franchise is becoming very clear given all the investments weve made including the launch of our digital bank enhanced data analytics and introducing new cash management tools for our commercial clients at the end of the last low rate cycle in our interest bearing deposit costs bottomed at about basis points this cycle we are already at basis points and we expect these costs to decrease to the lowteens by the end of the year as we execute our deposit playbook moving on to credit on slides and we saw strong credit results this quarter net chargeoffs were down basis points to basis points linked quarter this is at the lower end of our guidance for the first quarter and driven by a reduction in commercial first quarter commercial net chargeoffs included chargeoffs in areas of market concern including cre retail casual dining and one large chargeoff related to a financial sponsor citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 nonaccrual loans decreased million linked quarter with a million increase sic decrease in commercial driven by chargeoffs loan sales activity and repayments retail nonaccrual loans increased by million linked quarter driven by mortgage loans coming off forbearance however given the strength of the housing market with inventories at historical lows and strong ltvs in our book we expect little to no ph loss content in these mortgages in addition our commercial criticized loans continued to trend down this quarter decreasing by million or given the improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and performance of the portfolio our reserves decreased but remained robust ending the quarter at excluding ppp loans compared with at the end of the fourth quarter this is still significantly higher than our day one cecl implementation coverage we anticipate there likely will be further reserve releases assuming the macroeconomic outlook continues to strengthen and solidify we have some detailed credit slides in the appendix for your reference one on slide covering commercial credit since the start of the covid19 crisis we have been highlighting the commercial areas most impacted by the lockdown as we continue to see improvements in the operating environment these areas of concern have now decreased to of the total cfg loan portfolio down from in and approximately in the remaining areas of concern include cre retail and hospitality casual dining and arts entertainment and recreation and accordingly we are maintaining prudent reserve allocations with a reserve coverage of about for these areas we maintained excellent balance sheet strength as shown on slide increasing our cet1 ratio from in to at the end of the first quarter which is slightly above our target operating range after returning million of capital to shareholders in the quarter before i move on to our outlook let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company on slide on the left side of the page we were very pleased to be able to provide about billion in new ppp loans through the latest sba program providing critical funding to over of our small business customers on the consumer side weve recently announced the expansion of our national pointofsale offering for merchants through our citizens pay offering we are continuing to add new merchants to our pointofsale platform such as bjs wholesale club with more in the pipeline and the portfolio was up yearoveryear in addition we continue to make great strides in our digital transformation with our digital sales up yearover year clearly our customers are demanding a different distribution model from us one that allows for more efficient digital transactions and an adviceoriented focus in our branches weve launched our new mobile app on ios in january which is receiving great reviews with an average of stars in the app store in commercial we have built out a robust corporate finance advisory model which is supporting our geographic expansion efforts our capital markets business delivered its second best quarter ever in the first quarter demonstrating the benefits of the investments weve made over the last few years on the right side of the page you can see a high level view of our strategic priorities all of which remain on track and now for some highlevel commentary on the outlook for the second quarter on slide we expect nii to be up to with nim up modestly or broadly stable excluding elevated cash we expect loan growth of to in the second quarter followed by an acceleration in the back of the year earning assets are expected to be broadly stable in the second quarter fee income is expected to be down high singledigits reflecting lower citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 mortgage banking fees as gain on sale margins decline further towards more normal levels partially offset by strength across many of the remaining fee categories noninterest expense is expected to be down slightly we expect net chargeoffs will be in the range of to basis points of average loans with a meaningful reserve release through provision before i wrap up id like to provide some comments on this transition period towards economic recovery and our fullyear outlook first we remain confident in our ppnr outlook with nii higher and fees slightly lower than our original guidance let me give you some further color on the puts and takes were expecting loan growth to really pick up in driven by student pointofsale auto and mortgage as well as commercial utilization starting to rise from historical lows as the economy finds stable footing and companies begin to invest for growth coupled with a steeper yield curve this improves our nii outlook our outlook for fees is slightly lower driven by mortgage as we expect additional pressure on gain on sale margins as they begin to migrate lower as the curve steepens we should see a transition to greater contributions from purchase originations and servicing we have included some additional detail on the mortgage landscape in the appendix on slide we expect other fee categories namely capital and global markets and wealth to continue to be strong as we leverage our investments and the economy rebounds other categories like card fees and service charges and fees should also benefit as consumer confidence and spending picks up given these dynamics we expect ppnr to bottom in the second quarter and then rebound to levels higher than the first quarter for the remainder of the year given strength in nii and fees as well as wellcontrolled expenses we also expect to be close to neutral operating leverage in compared to followed by meaningful positive operating leverage in the second half we are also expecting a substantially better credit outlook for the fullyear given the strong performance of the loan portfolio and improvement in the macroeconomic forecast we are reducing our fullyear chargeoff guidance range to to basis points and with this improvement we could also see our acl ratio decline meaningfully from the current ex ppp to wrap up this was a strong start to for citizens as we begin to transition away from the effects of the pandemic to an improving outlook for interest rates and economic growth all while staying focused on executing across our strategic initiatives with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all right thanks john operator lets open it up to qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the qa portion of the conference call operator instructions our first question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank go ahead matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning your outlook for loan growth is a bit better than what weve heard so far from other folks and i was just wondering if you could elaborate on the drivers both in the nearterm and then how robust you think loan growth can be kind of when things fully reopen call it later this year or into next year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start off with that matt others may weigh in here but in the nearterm i think that the strength that were seeing is really attributable to our diversified consumer lending and retail businesses when you see what weve been able to do in the mortgage portfolio auto and education i think those are areas that have been areas of strength in the past and will continue to be in the second quarter i also believe that when we get into the second quarter youre going to start to see although across the industry were seeing utilization levels come down a bit in the first quarter i think we believe that thatll start to moderate and stabilize and start to head back up off of historic lows historic low levels so you can see commercial contributing as well in the second quarter and as you thatll create the staging ground if you will for what we see in the second half where the continuing expectations for reopening economic activity accelerating on the commercial side inventories building capex expenditures starting to recover and increase so those are the forces that we see in terms of loan growth throughout the year brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah on the consumer side thanks john id offer a couple of thoughts one across all the asset categories we unwound credit tightening that we did through covid and so we havent changed our risk appetite but the temporary tightenings that we did those are now broadly unwound so we should see originations pick up across all categories weve also turned on marketing that we had artificially suppressed last year as well assetby asset i think id mentioned last quarter we had sort of put auto in a flattish trend intentionally the market always allowed for us to grow but we were optimizing our balance sheet with all the excess deposits we had now on the short duration were finding incredibly high returns in the auto business so you should expect that to continue to moderately grow assuming that the environment allows for outsized returns which were not seeing slow down on the student side we have a record quarter ph in growth in our student loan refinance product at over million in originations that could moderate a tiny bit but still at record levels giving high rates and as the federal portfolio of student loans come off their forbearance in september that will provide another opportunity for growth and then seasonally in our inschool business were expecting a very big year as a lot of students took the year off given covid a big freshman class coming in and just seasonal growth in the summer and the fall and lastly pointofsale is an area that you know weve spent a lot of time and investment in weve got great traction were up to partners so were in the build phase there where as these partners ramp youre naturally getting sort of outsized growth sort of law of small numbers as the portfolio gets to scale so ive citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 got a lot of confidence in the outlook in consumer growth and underpinning that is obviously improvement in consumer confidence bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just add its bruce matt just one last proof point on the commercial side in addition to line utilization were just seeing activity start to build so our pipelines are much stronger at this point than they were early in the first quarter so thats a good sign of both economic activity backlogs in ma still pretty high so we see line utilization kicking in plus just the fresh deals and we continue to add bankers and grow our market share matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and is most of the demand build in commercial related to deals as you just referenced or is there also kind of some early signs of increased call it organic investment among our commercial borrowers bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think theres some of both matt quite honestly so right now you can see the economic stats are fantastic and so people are positioning to try to capture that demand and so that means increasing supply which requires some capital investment and then also labor bringing people back to work which frankly when we talk to many of our corporate customers has been a gating factor its hard to actually fill out their needs and were trying to be helpful on that with some initiatives around workforce development but the animal spirits are starting to kick in here matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator we will move next to the line of erika najarian with bank of america go ahead please erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good morning a followup to matts question because i want to make sure the market really understands this a lot of your larger peers that where their consumer exposure is more credit card related really talked to us over the past couple of days about how deleveraging was going to negatively impact demand and perhaps maybe give us a little bit more detail about why your consumer products are not necessarily going to be impacted the same as credit card citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah hey erika thanks its brendan id just say our credit card book is significantly smaller than our peers on an average basis to our overall loan book and so we are seeing a little bit of those dynamics in our credit card portfolio were not calling for growth in credit card but that delevering of our card book with all the extra stimulus has a much more muted impact for us on our overall consumer lending portfolio than others just given the relative undersized nature of our card book so we found opportunities to grow in more niche places like pointofsale which is the demand is generated by purchase activity and as the economy rebounds consumer confidence comes back folks are out there buying bigger ticket items again and the pointofsale business is there to help and very naturally lined up against the recovery of consumer spending and how we think about modern financing for consumers and while rates are going up they are still very very low if i look at student loan refinancing as i mentioned before something thats still going to be very very strong theres a lot of customers that are in the money thats a product that our peers generally speaking dont have and so thats generating outsized growth for us and similarly in student the inschool business as i mentioned before seasonally just naturally that were going to have some growth just by being in that business in the back half of the year which most of our peers dont have in auto again not to be too redundant but we had intentionally sidelined on it so were back in growth mode there at a moderate level so when you add all that up i think weve got a lot of confidence that were going to buck the trends that youre hearing from others and were proving it the numbers show in the last handful of quarters that were already delivering even through the covid period bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add to that diversification is important and so we have probably more portfolios and some welltargeted portfolios and niches that should continue to still grow so thats i think why well kind of buck the tide a little bit overall and i would just add also that the outlook for the socalled buynowpaylater or installment financing kind of tailoring products to people at pointofsale is very very positive i think the industry forecast for that is growth over the next five years and on card its much much lower first you have to get the rebound but then i think the youre low singledigit in terms of the growth outlook there so i think weve made a bet that this is going to be a burgeoning attractive area and i think were wellpositioned to catch some wind here erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and my second question is on the margin outlook for the second quarter and perhaps a little bit beyond thank you for giving us an update on how youre expecting ppp to unfold for the rest of the year im wondering in the nim up modestly guide how much forgiveness is assumed for the second quarter and also maybe give an outlook on how youre thinking about redeploying the excess cash for the rest of the year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go and take that erika i think just to focus on the second quarter i think that the rate environment is favorable to us and others but i think that were seeing nice tailwinds from the rate longend rise id also reference the fact that we added to our hedge portfolio in the first quarter and thats contributing and well get a citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 full quarter effect of that in the second quarter and just our overall mix and on both the asset and deposit side so greater dda in the first quarter and thats flowing into the second quarter and dont forget some of the comments i made earlier about our deposit costs thats a lever that continues to contribute and those are some of the important i think drivers into with more room to run there the basis points coming down to sort of into the teens into the second quarter and to the lowteens as you get to the end of the year so those are some of the forces ppp is less of a contributor its pretty as we mentioned it stabilizes overall nii but in terms of nim theres no real meaningful difference between forgiveness last quarter versus this quarter or next quarter so its really not a driver over the last quarter or next erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it so to clarify so the forces that are driving nim higher in the second quarter are all sort of core business trends john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island they are erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc and not ppp john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island they are rates balance sheet balance sheet mix deposit pricing and loan growth those are the things that were really driving us bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and just a further word on ppp john called it right but thats been pretty stable through the back half of last year through the first half of this year you look at the yields on those loans with forgiveness baked in its not a big winner for the bank so what we had anticipated was that wed start to see some falloff given the new program that was added the glide path down in the second half of the year is much less severe so i dont think the ppp this year will be a huge factor compared to last year on any sequential quarter that we would have to call out erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you so much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator we will go next to the line of john pancari with evercore isi your line is open citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi regarding your commentary on the operating leverage expectation for improvement and for i think youve referenced it as healthy level of operating leverage any way you could help us think about the magnitude in terms of sizing that up what type of level of operating leverage you think is achievable in the back half and then what that could possibly mean for as you look out bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so historically if you look at what we were able to deliver since the ipo weve probably been in a basis points of operating leverage type mode and whether that was or revenue growth and then or expense growth its kind of scaled with what the revenue environment is we tend to compress the expenses to try to maintain something like that and so clearly that would be our objective over time and as john indicated were kind of working through a transitory phase where the mortgage revenue has to reset it was a huge boon for last year we did basis points of operating leverage for all of last year which was fueled by mortgage so in the first half of the year as that normalizes that makes it hard to deliver the positive operating leverage although we did state in our guidance that we should come pretty close to neutral in the second quarter notwithstanding that kind of last leg to drop on mortgage revenues before it stabilizes once we can get back to kind of having that mortgage bottom out and were seeing nice growth in our fees were seeing our balance sheet grow were seeing good performance on nim then we should get back to having a nice top line and you can count on us to continue to constrain the expense growth weve done i think a really good job with the top program of repositioning citizens to be much more equipped for the future in terms of our technology so we have a nextgen technology element to that project we have huge going digital going to a digitalfirst business model going to that so it does require investment but our mindset all along has been to selffund to try to find the inefficiencies in how were running the place wring those out and then in turn go reinvest those and i think weve demonstrated over time that were quite good at that so were managing expense base tightly but were certainly keeping up with the investments that we need to position us for future growth john pancari q analyst evercore isi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 great thanks bruce thats helpful and then separately on the consumer side on the merchant partner side i have kind of a twoparter first just want to see if you can give us a little bit of color around riskadjusted returns youre able to get in that business in terms of maybe the loan yields that youre seeing on your partnership partnerships as well as the loss assumptions and then separately i know you mentioned buynowpaylater bruce interested if you if you believe you need more scale there to take advantage of the opportunity or if you need more capabilities on the digital front and therefore would you be open to an acquisition to give you greater scale or do you think the momentum you have already in the area is sufficient thanks brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks for that its brendan id say the riskadjusted returns on the pointofsale business the way you should think about it is its equivalent to a credit card profile the geography is a little different the yields are a little bit lower and the losses are meaningfully lower but the returns are equivalent to what youd expect on a prime card portfolio which is why we sort of disclose them all in the same bucket of other retail so which is great because if you think about that if youre getting equivalent credit card returns but lower losses that are going to perform even better through the cycle thats a very very attractive place to play and as ive shared in the past when you look at the credit performance of pointofsale through covid forbearance was basically nonexistent and delinquencies were down from precovid levels so that portfolio was operating as if there was no recession or lockdown going on around us and so were incredibly excited about that dynamic and we dont think it was artificially created the customer experience is so slick and integrated into consumers top wallet payment that really were kind of getting that top payment position in that product so very very excited about that relative to acquisition look were really bullish on our capabilities we think its very distinctive from what others offer in this space the old school traditional buynowpaylater players and even relative to some of the fintechs where were weve got a unique niche that we also have a balance sheet we dont have to offload these loans and it allows for a lot more creativity and innovation on how we structure the product as an example like the apple product where its a revolving purchase where the customer gets the new phone every year thats hard to do if youre reliant on capital markets to fund your business model so were excited about the business model if there is an acquisition that could help us accelerate at the right price of course we would look at it but i dont think we need one to get scale john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you appreciate you taking the questions operator well go next to peter winter with wedbush securities go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask about the average securities yields i noticed that it held steady quartertoquarter and im just wondering what the new reinvestment rate is on the securities and secondly if youre extending duration on that portfolio john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and ill take the last question first i think the as you know most of our portfolio is in the mortgagebacked security agency space and so really thats a ratedriven outcome and pretty typical that as you would see as rates rise prepayments slow and so those mortgagebacked will extend in duration and so thats really whats going on there we didnt actually through our purchase activity endeavor to extend the duration that was just an impact of the macro on the securities that we have i think the way that we look at the securities book its basically a few weeks ago i might have said that our reinvestment yields could have been in the neighborhood of to and might have been close to where the runoff yields would be but over the last couple of weeks as youve seen the rally in rates were sort of in the ill call it range and so itll be a negative frontbook backbook probably in the early part of the second quarter but as you get into the end of the third quarter based upon what we see you can start to see securities portfolio being the first sort of term book that starts to get to neutral on frontbook backbook and begins to become a positive contributor into the second half and id say more broadly those are the kind of thats the kind of dynamic youll see with other bond categories as one by one youll see improvements on that front the other thing again back to this is a broader nii nim story but if we believe where rates are headed and the forces all indicate that well get to higher longterm rates as you get to the end of the year well continue to layer in our swaps and our swap hedging program as well which will also contribute to nii and ph nim bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible when you start to see the curve steepen john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible swaps john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so the frontbook backbook converts from a headwind to sort of a tailwind as you get to the into the second half and then you can see our playbook on rate management all contributing to nii and nim peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 got it thank you and then just on the allowance for credit losses im just wondering with the improvement in credit how quickly do you think you can get back to that cecl day one level and does that level change just because the composition of the portfolio changing with more of the growth or more growth from consumer john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and take that youve seen us come down relatively meaningfully this quarter the way cecl works if you had perfect knowledge about where the macro is headed all of that good news and all of that expected outcome would all be built into our results this quarter but you also have to take into consideration the uncertainty around those expectations and the uncertainty as were turning towards much more positive macro that uncertainty in the range of potential outcomes is still very very wide and as a result we have a number of overlays that are judgmental in nature that sort of work together with our model outputs to give you what our results are so netnet the balance would be that we have big releases happening now if in fact the uncertainty around the base case begins to narrow you could see our coverage getting closer to day one as you get into the second half and towards the end of the year peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks operator well go next to the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess the first question just in terms of the swaps that you put on can you just talk about the duration of those i understand were sort of in a low rate environment but at some point rates will rise im just kind of curious how the timing of those swaps play out with your expectations for the fed fund hikes at some point john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the duration is five years on the swaps that we put on with the billion and thats relatively typical you sort of look at this on a dollar cost averaging basis when you see the fiveyear is really where a lot of this hedging happens when you saw the fiveyear go from basis points to basis points in a very short period of time thats a signal to trigger the first sort of tranche of hedging that you will do over time and really were not what youre doing is is you are reducing your downside when you start to layer hedges in and so our first tranche was triggered its contributing in a positive way it takes away and reduces the risk to lower rates over time but we basically you pause after that first sort of category of hedging and you wait for the next sort of range of rates before you get into the next tranche and so billion is a fraction of what our overall hedging will citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 be as you get to the end of the cycle and so rather than waiting to pick the perfect spot maybe a year from now and do all of our hedging all at once you tend to do it over time so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just leg into it it came to dollar cost averaging john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island absolutely bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible your portfolios john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and the last so the last tranche that you would do if and when the fiveyear hits its peak and then if you have a big rally in rates those that will widen out the first tranche that you do as you get towards the end of the five years if in fact rates continue to rise and rise and rise then you have those turn negative but those are more than offset by all of the positives of the hedging that you do as rates continue to rise ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc that makes perfect sense and then just my second question in terms of capital obviously a very strong cet1 at can you just talk about your plans or expectations like how does that eventually get absorbed now you cant buy back stock but it sounds a lot like youre also going to have stronger balance sheet growth john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think weve said this before our program here and our number one capital objectives are to support the dividend and to support organic growth and putting capital to work in support of our customers and clients so thats really our first objective and if we can do that in a way that is additive and returns exceed our cost of capital we think thats the right thing to do for the franchise and so thats our focus as we mentioned earlier we do have a transition to loan growth beginning in the second quarter the average loan growth to but spot loan growth in the second quarter will be higher than that as things begin to accelerate you could see or better spot growth in the second quarter alone and seeing those numbers go higher still if the environment unfolds the way we expect so thats our focus to the extent that we have excess capital even after supporting all of those things then thats when you get into how we look at returning it to shareholders through the form of buybacks and thinking in parallel about bolton fee acquisitions ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you operator our next question will be from scott siefers with piper sandler go ahead citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys thanks for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i think the first question is sort of a followup on the capital one from the prior question just given that the credit concerns are kind of melting away is there any opportunity to maybe revisit your internal capital targets a little lower or a little higher than some of your peers and of course some of that im sure is just due to the complexion of the balance sheet but nonetheless with the risk profile improvement i just would be curious to hear any thoughts there bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its bruce so we as youre aware have inched down over time so i think initially we had a target as our cet1 ratio and then we went to to and now were to so i think initially coming out of the ipo as a relatively new company without a longterm track record having a little higher cet1 targets than peers made sense youve seen through the ccar work at our credit losses stress at median or better slightly better than median and so theres really not such a significant need any longer to carry that little extra cushion although i do like to sleep well at night and so i think a strong capital ratio helps with that but over time well see where the peer group goes and if the peer group continues to inch down given a positive outlook for the foreseeable future theres no reason that we couldnt do that as well but at this point were locked in for this year with that to range and i think that gives us plenty of firepower given the capital were generating potential for future reserve releases to pursue our agenda of the significant loan growth and potentially some feebased acquisitions and also giving some back to our shareholders r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you and then maybe john just sort of a followup on some of the actions you took regarding rate sensitivity in the first quarter i think i can sort of back into some of it based on kind of what you said about duration and things like that but i think you guys have said in the past your rate sensitivity is sort of shortend versus longend is there any meaningful change in how that looks now following some of those first quarter actions john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah not much of a difference id maybe call it but basically thats about where we are short long in terms of the complexion r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 okay perfect all right thank you very much guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator next well go to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc hey guys this is amanda larsen on for ken bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc i guess on the loan growth outlook for to you did talk about the buckets but if you can kind of just talk about the mix that you would expect of just commercial versus consumer in that would be helpful john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i think that retail i would describe it as is really going to be leading the way in the second quarter as commercial takes maybe begins its march and as the recovery really contributes to higher utilization and as those loan pipelines that you heard from bruce earlier begin to sort of realize themselves so id say in the second quarter its probably i dont know something in the neighborhood of twothirds onethird with the majority coming from retail but commercial clearly contributing and beginning to be a bigger contributor as you get into the second half of the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think youve got some for average loan purposes youve got to work through some of the dynamics in the first quarter but what were pretty excited about is on a spot basis we see significant growth in the second quarter which will set us up well for growth in the second half of the year so the goal really in the second quarter is to really layer in that nice spot level of growth that wont fully manifest itself in the average numbers so therefore were at the to but it does if we achieve it set us up extremely well for the third quarter amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay super and then john can you just explain the conversation on swaps with how much you earned on cash flow hedges in the first quarter and then maybe whats expected for and beyond assuming libor is flat from here citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the way that weve talked about that in the past is really on a yearoveryear basis given that the portfolio is contractual and you can sort of see it weve talked last year based upon the portfolio that was in place at the time that year from would be about a call it million to million decline in contribution from the swap portfolio versus just with the billion that we put on in the first quarter thats been cut in half and so the headwind from swaps is really declining if rates continue to rise from here that number will continue to decline off of that level i think the broader point though is you cant really look at it in isolation you got to look at overall as we indicated net interest margin being broadly stable excluding excess cash and frankly rising if you consider whats going on with deployment of cash and whats happening with our expectations on loan growth and another reminder on our deposit costs thats a lever thats unique to us we may have come down a little slower than others because we had a lot farther to come and so basis points headed to call it midteens in the second quarter headed to lowteens to the end of the year thats another driver so the big picture including all of the swap dynamics net interest margin appears to be stabilizing and is an improving picture going forward bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its funny that what was a gap versus peers with slightly higher deposit costs turns into a lever turns into an asset when youre going through this environment so many of the peers have already reached levels that its hard to improve upon on their interestbearing deposit costs where we still have some room to run amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc indiscernible all right thank you so much operator well go next to the line of bill carcache with wolfe research go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments you guys have a unique view given your mix of consumer versus commercial lending can you give a bit more color on how you see pentup demand dynamics playing out across both groups as we make further progress into the reopening it sounds like you think there will be a bit more gearing initially on the consumer versus commercial side but i was hoping you could just expand on that thought process and how does the excess liquidity that both groups have available play into that thinking bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island brendan brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i can start yeah on the consumer side i think the growth that were projecting is sort of happening underlying right now and well get a bit of a tailwind from the reopening and consumer confidence growing but citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 the structure of our products are so diversified and naturally set up to give us outsized growth id mentioned earlier student loan refinancing you should think about that a lot like mortgage when rates are low and even though theyre ticking up a little bit theyre still historically low that creates a boom of demand its almost like stimulus another form of stimulus for customers that were providing through restructuring their payments down and so that just is naturally demanded now independent of reopening similarly with pointofsale i mentioned as the economy reopens customers are starting to do big ticket purchases again were seeing our debit transaction average ticket go up pretty significantly those transactions are now up yearoveryear its very clear consumers are starting to spend again which means pointofsale opening seems wellpositioned for growth with the economy reopening were seeing that anyway even independent of another tickup of the economy reopening and auto has been a hot market the auto industry sales are really really high and the market is still bearing outsized returns and so indiscernible were going to continue we got a diversified auto business number one jd power in the country in auto were very wellpositioned to grow that business in a well controlled way with doubledigit roes which you dont typically see with auto so yeah i think as the economy reopens that should provide a bit of another nudge and a tailwind but even at a moderately slow pace of the economy reopening i still feel pretty good given the diversification of our business that well get the growth that were calling for in consumer bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would say we still would expect to see some elevated cash levels and a lot of times thats kind of geared to folks who worked in the service industries and had lots of employment and are still kind of holding on to precautionary cash levels given the circumstances so that will i think run down fairly gradually but these other factors that brendan mentioned are somewhat separate from that theyre not as impacted by kind of the stimulus money thats been paid out and then i think on the commercial side its really just a question of how fast folks take a positive view about the needtomeet demand if they see demand rising then they can start investing and then how do they finance that they can use some of the big liquidity levels that they were able to amass but i think youll see that corporate cash start to drop some but then going back and borrowing on lines is kind of the next phase that you would expect to see and then some special purpose facilities to build a new plant or things like that or just the deals that continue to happen and the financing that goes with those acquisitions so we would expect to see were already starting to see that some of that cash is getting put to work and it really just depends on how fast the view about the economic improvement solidifies bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you if i could follow up do you think that the elevated payment rates that weve been seeing really on the consumer side broadly have peaked based on what you guys are seeing or particularly with the effects of the latest stimulus checks or could those potentially remain elevated for a bit longer here before we start to see them come down and i guess contribute a bit more to some of that improvement in balances that youre expecting brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 yeah so the elevated stimulus on prepayment rates is mostly felt on credit card which we are in our guidance still calling for credit card to shrink slightly healthy purchase activity but theres a lot of cash out in the environment as you point out some of the prepay rates that were seeing on other products are not necessarily stimulusdriven like mortgage with a lot of churn and refinancing were originating taking share but the portfolio is growing but theres a lot of underlying ph prepayments but that will start to slow as interest rates go up moderately although we still think volume and demand is going to be very very heavy but its going to turn towards purchase versus refi so we should see a natural slowing of prepay on the mortgage portfolio id also say on home equity we dont talk about that very often its a very big business for us and its been slowly shrinking and shrinking faster in the industry you got a lot of the big banks that are sitting on the sidelines at the moment that have really curtailed or even shut down their home equity originations platforms so were enjoying market share thats almost double what we naturally get which wed naturally get really high market share in this industry so i expect us to at a minimum be a slower decline than others on home equity for prepay speeds given the size and pace of our originations capacity and theres some optimism potentially that we could start to see home equity flatten and not be a headwind anymore for us so theres a lot of dynamics i think at play there but really your question around stimulus will be most felt in credit card and that is called for in our underlying guidance and more than offset by those other dynamics bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator well go next to the line of saul martinez with ubs go ahead please mr martinez your line is open go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc sorry about that i was on mute thanks for taking my question youve indicated that most of the expected decline in noninterest income is coming from lower mortgage banking fees but that it should sort of hit a floor in the second quarter i guess i just want to understand the logic there a little bit better what gives you confidence that we will see a floor and well start to see it in and we wont see further compression in margins beyond that that pressures the overall fee line and then secondly ill just ask my second question now on the swaps what receive rate are you getting on those because i guess i understand the logic of averaging in and legging into it but maybe the i guess the flip side of that is it does seem a little bit out of step on the surface to me with the view that you expect rates to continue to rise where it seems like maybe you can argue that its a bit premature to leg into it already so if you can just flesh that out for us a little bit bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 sure on mortgage what weve seen happen kind of starting in late third quarter into the fourth quarter was the industry gearing up in terms of capacity adding capacity to really capture the whole refi opportunity and that and then you had some of these big nonbank players going public and being pretty aggressive around market share so the very high gain on sale margins that were kind of frankly amazing and unsustainable back in q3 have started to normalize back to historical levels based on those factors those forces and so we kind of see that playing out through the second quarter and then restoring kind of getting restored to levels that weve seen historically and the current view is unlikely to go meaningfully below that so thats the assumption that were making the flip side to that is that theres also a strong outlook for originations were looking at over trillion which should be next to another record year in terms of originations and were probably seeing a shift from refi to a little bit more purchase in the mix and were very wellpositioned in our retail channel to capture that so still looking at a strong level of origination so theres really no headwinds there at all and then the size of our servicing book and the msr asset all of that should offer somewhat of an offset to the fall in margins so well see i think weve been pretty good at forecasting these dynamics but the market is the market well see how it plays out but i think weve thought pretty hard about the factors and tried to project those out and so we feel pretty confident that thats the likely scenario for q2 and then for the rest of the year so ill stop there unless you want to add anything brendan brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think its wellsaid the one maybe data point i would add to that just to kind of accentuate the rebound in purchase offsetting some of the refi decline is that over the last days weve seen about a growth rate in purchase volume coming through our retail channel so its not just hopes and dreams were seeing an actual and real momentum through the business bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island so we feel pretty good about the volume outlook to bruces point the margins bottoming at level is really the key assumption that it doesnt go any deeper than historical levels and were seeing it starting to stabilize right now so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah good so well flip the second question over to john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks so saul i think the point here is we saw a pretty rapid rise in the fiveyear over the last several months as i mentioned i think at the end of last year it was around basis points it had gotten i think frankly north of basis points but i think its settling in around basis points right now that is really emblematic of the first sort of risk triggers that we think about and basically this is an interest rate risk hedging program and that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 hedging program really requires us to consider where our asset sensitivity is and what the downside exposures are and so from that perspective we have several sort of triggers and tranches of hedging that well do over time this is the first one and i think there would be another one as and if rates continue to rise although its our expectation that rates will continue to rise the last sort of couple of weeks is a reminder that things can deviate from your base case and so were just being prudent risk managers and taking our asset sensitivity from around to something thats in the very high singledigits and as we get to the top of the rate cycle well get back down to something thats in the lower singledigits similar to where weve been in the past and thats a very prudent sort of approach versus waiting around for the perfect time to begin to hedge bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the other question you asked was what the receive rate was during that range of to basis points in the fiveyear we did most of the hedging towards the upper end of that range but that will give you the answer there bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah good saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc thank you bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all right i think theres no more questions in the queue so again i want to thank everybody for dialing in today we certainly appreciate your interest and support have a great day and everybody stay well
