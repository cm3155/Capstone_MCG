q3 earnings call 25oct2023 thank you kay good morning im happy to be here with you today to share the details of our strong third quarter performance our results reflect a strong disciplined loan growth stable deposits continued momentum in many of our feegenerating businesses expense control stable margin and solid asset quality i continue to be extremely proud of the long track record of prudent underwriting that has produced these asset quality metrics our loan portfolio remains healthy with basis point net chargeoffs for the third quarter and just basis points yeartodate nonperforming loans improved basis points from basis points the prior quarter provision for credit losses was million for the quarter compared to million in the second quarter driven largely by changes in macroeconomic variables and general improvement in the watch and classified categories the average chargeoff ratio for the fivequarter period shown in our deck is the lowest in our history impressive considering the increase in average loan balances during that same time period we saw improvement in the levels of both past watch loans and classified loans which declined and respectively from the second quarter our watch list levels fluctuate from time to time as we manage the book and historically weve seen very little migration to loss our current historical credit performance has been achieved through our focus on risk management a consistent approach that comes from having the same team working together for multiple cycles and decades we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic trends and have regular conversations with our clients across our footprint something we do in all economic environments despite uncertainty from the brewing geopolitical crisis as well as the volatility in interest rates our commercial clients remain cautiously optimistic now ill cover a few highlights from the quarter and ram will follow up a few details and drivers gaap net income for the third quarter was million or per share operating net income was million or per share net interest income decreased from the second quarter as loan growth improved and asset mix and yields were offset by an increase in deposit costs while net interest income for the industry continued to be impacted by higher funding costs our net interest margin in the third quarter was essentially flat on a linked quarter basis the flexibility on the asset side of our balance sheet helped mitigate the continued impact of liability pricing we have a loantodeposit ratio lower than our peers and industry medians and largely variable asset base and strategically planned cash flows in fee income we saw solid results in several lines of businesses trust and securities processing income increased driven by growth in all business contributing to this line fund services corporate trust and private wealth in fund services assets under administration reached billion in the third quarter yeartodate our team has added nearly new clients which helped drive a increase in revenue as we saw on a linkedquarter basis our noninterest expense level fell by and included variances in deferred compensation expense related to the reduced coli income additionally severance expense declined along with salary and wage expense reflecting the ongoing efforts to control operating expenses ram will provide more additional color on these various drivers shortly turning to the balance sheet the drivers behind our annualized growth in average loan balances this quarter are shown on slide for comparison the banks that reported results through october at a median linkedquarter annualized increase of the federal reserve h8 data had predicted an increase in industry umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 wide average loan balances of just or annualized despite some caution surrounding the current environment our relationship banking model continues to build a pipeline of quality clients and given what were seeing today we expect some continued outperformance relative to the industry and loan growth metrics total topline loan production as seen on slide was million with payoffs and paydowns declining slightly representing of loans for the quarter credit quality is strong across our book and the cre portfolio remains welldiversified by property classification tenant type and geography as shown on the slide on page and looking ahead to the fourth quarter we see opportunity across our various lending verticals and geographic regions we have continued to evaluate the best use of our capital and we remain disciplined on pricing further emphasizing lending opportunities accompanied by meaningful deposit relationships on the other side of the balance sheet average total deposits were essentially flat versus the second quarter declines in brokered cd balances and typical seasonal reductions in public funds were offset by growth in commercial deposit balance we expect public fund balances will begin to rebuild again in the fourth quarter as weve noted previously deposit balances will naturally ebb and flow as our largely commercial customer base uses funds for typical business purposes including payroll dividends and other activities finally weve strengthened our liquidity and capital positions even further during the quarter as depicted on slide our quarterend cet1 and total capital ratios were at and improved by basis points and basis points respectively from june our cet1 ratio compares favorably to the peer median and in our press release we announced that the board had approved a increase in our dividend bringing it to per share payable in january as weve shown on slide of our presentation our quarterly dividend has increased over the past years there were individual dividend increases during that period to wrap it up were pleased with our results this quarter the pundits have varying opinions but it seems clear that inflation levels however you want to measure it havent reached the federal reserves expectations all indications are that the datadependent fed will pause on further interest rate hikes the variables now are when rate cuts may begin and how quickly they may happen but we fully expect a higher for longer scenario at least through such a scenario would be favorable for our balance sheet as the pressure on deposit costs largely abate while asset repricing continues through that period additionally earning asset yields will improve as we use cash flows from our securities portfolio on higher yielding loans with the uncertainty in the macro and geopolitical environment we feel that our business model is prepared for a wide range of outcomes it has proven itself over time as weve adapted to the changing environment and set of circumstances now ill turn it over to ram for a more detailed look at our results ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner ill share a few additional drivers of our third quarter results then ill discuss some key balance sheet items net interest margin for the third quarter was a decrease of just basis point from the linked quarter the largest drivers included positive impact of approximately basis points from loan repricing and mix and basis points from the benefit of free funds these positives were mostly offset by a reduction of basis umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 points from changes in the interestbearing deposit pricing frankly to date our earning asset beta has been keeping pace with the total costoffunds beta of our deposit remix showed some signs of slowing this quarter and we ended the quarter with of total average deposits in ddas this level is in line with the low point during the tightening cycle and although its difficult to know for certain we expect were approaching the bottom the decline in dda balances largely reflects corporate trust activity which can be episodic commercial dda balances increased approximately over the linked quarter with the current consensus that the fed will hold rates for the time being we continue to expect the terminal beta of approximately of total deposits and for loans through the end of this cycle looking ahead for the fourth quarter we expect nii to trend flat to slightly up while well see some additional modest margin compression driven by mix shift at ratebearing public funds come on the balance sheet our reported noninterest income of million contains a marketrelated variances to second quarter levels including a million decrease in companyowned life insurance income and decrease in customer related derivative income as well as the impact of the million gain on the sale of assets we discussed last quarter these decreases were offset by a million increase in trust and securities processing income driven largely by the new client acquisition in our fund services and corporate trust businesses the detailed drivers of our million in noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release a few items of note we recorded million in salary and benefits expense a decrease of million compared to the second quarter included were just in deferred compensation expense a reduction of million from the prior quarter this is the offset to decreased coli income million in severance expense a reduction of million a million decrease in salary and wages and million reduction in various other employee benefit costs these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in operational losses considering the impact of million of severance along with the deferred compensation expense and typical timing variances we would put our quarterly starting point for expenses close to million looking ahead we expect well make a typical fourth quarter charitable contribution of approximately million our effective tax rate was yeartodate compared to in the same period in the decreased rate was driven primarily by a larger portion of income from taxexempt securities and variations in the level of coli income for the fullyear we continue to expect a tax rate between and now turning to more detail on the balance sheet ill start with our investment portfolio shown on slides and our average investment security balances declined from the second quarter to billion the heldto maturity book included billion of industrial revenue bonds during the quarter million of securities with an average yield at rolled up the yield on our total afs portfolio increased to and has a duration of just over four years the heldtomaturity portfolio exclusive of the irb bonds i mentioned had an average yield of for the third quarter additionally the portfolio is expected to generate more than billion of cash flows in the next months providing further funding flexibility the rolloff of these securities which have a blended rate of will also umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 improve our aoci position over that period as of september the unrealized pretax loss of afs portfolio was million or of the amortized cost for the htm portfolio this loss was million including the irb bonds slide highlights our liquidity position along with contingent sources of funding as of september we had billion in available liquidity sources liquidity coverage of adjusted uninsured deposits increased to at quarterend our tangible common equity ratio was at september when excluding the impact of aoci that ratio improved to tangible book value was per share an increase of compared to the same period a year ago since september we have experienced a annualized growth rate in tangible book value per share as we noted last quarter we maintain our focus as a growth company while positioning our balance sheet to support that growth and provide the flexibility to address uncertainty in the industry that concludes our prepared remarks and i will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions first question today comes from nathan race with piper sandler your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yep hi everyone good morning thanks for taking the questions mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co ram in terms of kind of the expectations for nii to be kind of flat to slightly down in the quarter curious kind of what that contemplates in terms of the size of the earning asset base into the fourth quarter it looks like you guys were able to reduce some wholesale sources in the quarter and you also have about billion maturing in the fourth quarter so just trying to think how we should think about the trajectory of the earning asset base indiscernible ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 yeah sure nate no material change in our investment portfolio other than cash flows that will continue to rotate out into the loan portfolio so youll see that in one of our slide decks we have what the expected cash flows from the portfolio is going to be we still havent purchased any new securities as you see in that disclosure as well and then everything else on the earning asset side is going to be largely loan growth so no material changes in the fed account balances yes we did bring down our liquidity balances from the second quarter to the third quarter but dont expect it to change materially from where it was mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i would just add that as weve done in the past we expect loan growth in the fourth quarter to be light and strengths to the to the quarter we just ended that was strong nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful changing gears thinking about fee income going forward obviously you had nice growth in fund services revenue corporate and institutional asset management just curious how that pipeline looks in terms of new client win opportunities and as kind of the rate of growth that we saw in versus is kind of sustainable going forward mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah that the strength remains very good fund services in particular we mentioned in our deck is had new clients yeartodate and which is represents i think it gives us over growth in the segment the pipeline remains very strong for that business theres been a lot of dislocation continues to be a lot of dislocation in the space as the private equity firms have gotten into the business and acquired our competitors has been very good for our business and we expect that to continue to be the case corporate trust you know the money has been unlocked projects are getting done the public and private projects are getting done and thats unlocking value for us there everyone has seen whats happened with the airline activity being up and strong and moving again so there we continue to and expect in the coming quarters for that revenue to unlock in our at our aviation vertical thats in corporate trust our health care business continues to be strong as we continue to focus more on direct sales with our customer base our forward spend we expect it to continue to be strong going forward whether its healthcare spend or its commercial so kind of all cylinders really we feel like theres nice profile of growth across all of our noninterest income verticals and continue to feel good about that as you know you know in the second quarter we had that hard sales of about million so if you take that out the trajectory from quarter to quarter and looking forward its pretty strong nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just lastly turning to credit quality its great to see improvement across the board in i think one thing that weve seen from some of your peers thus far in earnings season is some greater scrutiny on shared national credits so just curious if you could remind us how large that portfolio is and to what degree you guys age in any club deals or shared national credits within the portfolio umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 thomas s terry a executive vice president chief lending officer umb financial corp yeah this is tom pardon me tom terry chief credit officer the shared national credits that we have about billion maybe closer to billion almost all of those related to other businesses so for example our fund services business we have large health insurance companies as clients and we will participate in their shared national credit to support the fee income that we get on the fund services side so were not interested in shared national credits for the sake of being in them the lions share are ones that support other business and theyre high quality as far as indiscernible were we age very pardon me very few of those so does that answer your question nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it yeah yeah mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think that commitment is outstanding outstanding indiscernible much thomas s terry a executive vice president chief lending officer umb financial corp correct mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp outstanding to be much much slower slower thomas s terry a executive vice president chief lending officer umb financial corp yeah the billion is the commitment for now nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp their most most i would say a lot of the the comment on the on those fund services related lines theyre sort of really backup lines and doomsday line etcetera they dont they dont really get used for the most part thomas s terry a executive vice president chief lending officer umb financial corp right nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 so utilization of the billion is like in terms of funded ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp the balances are nate the balances at were about just under million so yes the utilization tends to be pretty low as tom said these are other clients that we have outstanding lines to but dont get capped mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp right ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah just making sure commitments are larger and balances are under million nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and you really havent seen any negative credit migration within that portfolio recently mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp not at all ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp not at all mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp none of them are on the watch list ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp correct nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great ill step back thanks for the color ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody mariner maybe a question for you youve talked and done a really good job historically on operating leverage expenses were really wellcontrolled this quarter how should we be thinking about operating leverage in this increasingly tough environment for revenue mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i think you kind of hit with a nail on the head there to see in the environment with really pretty much whats happened with interest cost right its a storyline there its more challenging in this environment to accomplish really i would guess what any of us want to accomplish we are still laserfocused on it and its obviously we dont give guidance but itd be hard for us to point you in any one direction kind of early in the year to think about the budget for next year just to really be able to talk intelligently about where that might head but we are operating leverage and as opposed to efficiency ratio is definitely where we put our emphasis and well continue to be focused on it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i think i want to make sure i heard you on the fourth quarter loan growth was the was the expectation moderation from this quarter or ph how many is that mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp similar in strength christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it and then finally in terms of the balance sheet some of your peers are thinking about retooling some of the investment portfolio given the moving rates i mean any appetite to move things around in the bond portfolio obviously youre not reinvesting but any kind of restructuring that might be contemplated ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey chris as you know we routinely evaluate these kinds of opportunities but at this time very little appetite desire or need really to do any of that umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks for taking the questions mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks chris operator operator instructions we now turn to timur braziler with wells fargo securities your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe a hi just following up on that last line of questioning was the seasonal inflow expected on the public funds i guess whats the expectation for the bond book and size next quarter are you going to be reinvesting some of those proceeds that are rolling off or is the bond book going to remain a source of funds for the loan growth youre seeing ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp it will remain a source of funds through the end of the year and maybe early into next year and then well have to evaluate based on loan production and deposit goals and whatnot but at this point were still going to let it fund our balance sheet growth or loan growth i should say timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then looking at the loan growth the cre construction growth remains pretty impressive im just wondering how much of that is contractual as some of these loans start to fund up on schedule and what that pipeline looks like over the next couple of quarters ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp its a mix a lot of the funding weve seen certainly are deals that we approved over the last six months and months that are now hitting the construction phase theres still activity were still seeing on demand for multi family and for industrial albeit its probably slowed a little bit but there is still demand still seeing activity so its a to answer your question specifically in terms of funding though its a mix of what weve approved over the last six months to months umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and theres stuff ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and then theres stuff timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp ph going on further mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yep timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just on the construction component specifically any ill effects from the broader environment are you hearing are you hearing that borrowers are taking more of a waitandsee approach whether its rates or just economic uncertainty i guess any kind of color you can provide on some of the earlystage building conversations youre having mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think you know ill echo the comment this is mariner that tom said which is that theres plenty of opportunity the mix is changing right so multifamily and industrial remain very strong while obviously office and other categories are winning significantly so with a higher interest rate environment and a low supply housing supply in the marketplace theres still very strong interest and demand for multifamily there are pockets in the country where that isnt the case there are places where theres over investment there are places where people are building class a when the need is class b etcetera so we pay attention to those kind of issues to stay away from problems but there is strong demand that we understand for multifamily and industrial continues to be strong because theres a real need for lastmile distribution and tilt up buildings to support the amazonification of america and delivery and then all of the businesses that either support amazon or compete with amazon so theres theres a pretty significant buildout underway that we believe and understand still to support the way consumers receive delivery of goods in america so we think those two things continue to present strong highquality opportunities for us umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 the real shift in our book going forward in the environment were in with excess liquidity gone from the system is were more focused on making sure we reserve our capital for customers and people who do business with us and are willing to put their deposits and broaden their relationship with us so that that would be the the only difference as you think about the landscape of opportunity we still see quite a bit of opportunity and really really about us honing in and making sure that were reserving that for people who really want to deepen their relationships with us timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for that and then just last for me on the expense side appreciate the guide for fourth quarter maybe as we look into and again parlaying on chriss question how much of how much leverage is there on the expense base in order to drive positive operating leverage should we expect expenses to grind higher through or is there confidence that those can be fairly wellmaintained and be a positive source of operating leverage mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we certainly think we can continue to maintain at a minimum maintain what weve been able to accomplish i its too early to tell what else and we dont give any guidance but theres always room to improve and to be better i would think any at any company and we continue look for those those opportunities to do business i would say to do business smarter and were always looking for those opportunities and i think well forever uncover them timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the question mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks timur operator we have a followup question from nathan race at piper sandler your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah thanks for taking the followup just kind of curious thinking about how you guys are thinking about the margin trajectory next year in the higherforlonger rate environment obviously youre seeing less pressure on the index deposits under that scenario and you have some kind of lag in repricing in terms of the duration of the portfolio in and of itself on the loan side of things so any kind of preliminary thoughts on how you guys are thinking about the margin and nii trajectory next year under those frameworks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp appreciate the opportunity to make our case for our investment thesis yeah we do believe that and under a higherforlonger scenario if the fed stops which that would you know that would be the scenario where we would anticipate and under that scenario the deposits the pressure on the deposits will alleviate and new and umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 repricing credit would continue to add value along with the rollup of the investment portfolio into higher yielding assets so that is that is the expectation if the fed does stop nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and i know its difficult to predict future provisioning impacts under cecl but just kind of any thoughts on kind of how you guys are thinking about providing for growth and assuming youre not really seeing any material credit issues on the horizon ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah thats a milliondollar question nate so as youve seen in the last few quarters given our credit quality most of our provision really come came from both macroeconomic variables changing in this past quarter because moodys moved towards more of a soft landing our provision was low compared and then our charge offs were low as well so it really depends on what level of loan growth that we have and what happens to the macroeconomic variables as mariner said we had decline in quarteroverquarter on our past watch loans and in our classified so from a portfolio of health perspective thats not a lot of pressure but as weve said the magic math that we have to work sometimes is trying to get our coverage ratio at or close to right thats kind of what we would like entering any kind of cycle whether its good or bad nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it so it sounds like absent material macro deterioration the expectations for you guys to build a reserve close to over the next few quarters just in support of loan growth and assuming chargeoffs ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah were at bps yeah were within splitting this and were at basis points coverage id say plus or minus a few basis points here and there on what our coverage ratio ends up being mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and then just one last one i know you guys dont pay a ton of attention to endofperiod balances but i was more surprised to see the noninterestbearing attrition accelerate versus last quarter any thoughts on kind of when that could bottom based on what you see in terms of client spending and so forth ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp so if you look at what happened as i said in the script our commercial dda balances so its what youre alluding to about cash usage that actually was up on an average basis and the decline in the third quarter dda umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 balances were more episodic because of some of our corporate trust deals theres always a seasonal buildup and tax payments go out so we know and its very predictable from that standpoint so i would say on the commercial side things are fairly stabilized again its really as we said we think were approaching the bottom in terms of our dda to total deposits which was the cycle low from last time but thats the to your earlier question thats the biggest x factor on what can change our margin or our net interest income curve from here mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean i would just none of us know right but i would just suggest that as the fed has done and the way our income statement has worked and our customer base works we said this all summer long we would go through this first because our customers were largely commercial weve seen that we think thats largely done and we we predicted that because of the last cycle being at thats done were today so from here your guess is as good as ours using the history and the behavioral patterns it seems as though were near the bottom on that on that shift nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just in terms of overall deposits expectations average deposits were flat in the quarter just curious based on what you guys see in terms of your pipeline how youre thinking about overall deposit growth expectations over the next several quarters mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we we continue to have a strong pipeline this all comes down to cost at the end of the day we have a very very strong ability i think in a way that most banks our size dont to tap deposits its really about paying market rate for them and then really its about assets and liabilities about our disciplined approach to pricing assets not just the deposits and so we dont concern ourselves too much with the ability to grow our deposits we just have to make sure that were disciplined on the way we manage assets and liabilities and making sure which weve been able to do todate to bring on loans we feel very comfortable about our ability to price them appropriately to maintain at a respectable margin spread nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate you guys taking the followups thanks again mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks yeah i might just remind everybody were done just because its been a and you start in april with the way the world look and you look and then you get to where we are now we really feel pretty good about our where we sit and just want to remind you a couple of things i said a moment ago umb said early on in the summer and spring that we would get to likely get to on noninterestbearing total and thats about where we sit here now we said we would go through the margin trouble early and then while others were seeing the declines weve flattened out on a linkedquarter basis youve seen us flatten out margin on a linkedquarter basis we continue umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 to tell you were going to have outsized loan growth we continue to have outsized loan growth we continue to tell the street about our ability over time to manage asset quality and while everybodys asset quality looks good right now ours looks good in the last cycle so we continue to have excellent asset volume weve had the best five quarters linked together weve had in our history from an asset quality standpoint and we have the same management team managing credit that weve seen through the last few cycles were still on top of credit this cycle and we expect that well continue to manage our company the way we always have and lastly were one of the few banks this quarter on a linkedquarter basis to show reduction in expenses of in our case and so really across the board everything that we can control weve controlled and have performed and any business every once in a while for geopolitical reasons or otherwise their input costs go up and so this is a job to manage how you pass on those costs or you become more efficient and were doing our job and were pleased with our results and we hope you are as well kay gregory senior vice president directorinvestor relations umb financial corp thanks mariner thanks everyone for joining us today and if you have any followup questions you can always reach
