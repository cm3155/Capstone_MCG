cover our presentation materials prepared comments and qa i will now turn the call over to john john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you dana and thank you for joining our call today were pleased with our performance this quarter and importantly were beginning to see increased activity across our footprint that gives us a greater confidence for overall growth in the second half of the year earlier this morning we reported earnings of million resulting in an earnings per share of per share credit quality at regions and across the industry has demonstrated remarkable resiliency throughout the pandemic broadly speaking since the pandemic began i believe banks have done a tremendous job staying close to customers and supporting their needs by providing capital advice and guidance as i have begun to trap our footprint again and meet with customers i see them gaining confidence in the economic recovery and in their own business plans ive seen the strength of our markets firsthand this combined with the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plan has positioned regions well for growth as the economic recovery continues we remain focused on clients selectivity riskadjusted returns and capital allocation all while making investments particularly in talent and technology to support growth for example over the last year we redesigned our mobile app and are continuing to make further enhancements to both our online and mobile platforms with these tied to sales process you can now apply for almost any consumer banking product online were putting digital tools in the hands of our bankers and contact center associates allowing customers to start a process in one channel and seamlessly transition to another we now have esignature capabilities across most of the franchise as a result of all of these changes yeartodate digital sales were up over the prior year regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 we have also leveraged artificial intelligence to build lead generation and next best action tools for our bankers were also utilizing artificial intelligence in our contact centers reggie our virtual banker is on pace to handle over a million customer calls this year technology investments have also allowed nearly of our contact center associates to work remotely providing permanent cost saves from reductions in legacy corporate space in addition over the last three years weve increased mortgage loan originators by approximately loans and well continue to add talent as we grow market share weve also added approximately clientfacing associates across the corporate bank and wealth management with a particular focus on growth markets weve consolidated over branches while opening de novo primarily within dense fastgrowing markets these new branches have contributed almost of our total rebuild checking account growth over the last three years were also investing in products and capabilities to serve our customers in wealth management we deepened our expertise in the notforprofit and health care space through the acquisition of highland associates and were working on a digital advisory solution with deployment targeted for late this year or early next last year we purchased ascentium capital to help small businesses with their essential equipment needs and the platform has performed well throughout the pandemic on the consumer side we just announced an agreement to acquire enerbank the top five originator and the home improvement point of sale space which were really excited about going forward well continue to look for bolton acquisitions that provide products and capabilities that are important to our customers win some really great markets as reflected on the slide you see now these markets coupled with our goto market strategy and aided by technology investments have helped us realize some really nice growth and consumer checking accounts our yeartodate account growth is nearly times higher than our pre pandemic rate for the same period so we have a really solid strategic plan that supports our goal of generating consistent sustainable longterm performance and we have a proven track record of successful execution we feel very good about our progress and believe we are really wellpositioned to grow as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum in our markets now david will provide you with some details regarding the quarter david j turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average adjusted loans remain stable during the quarter although adjusted ending loans increased confirming our view that loan growth should begin in the back half of the year although corporate loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity pipelines have now surpassed prepandemic levels production remains strong with new and renewed commitments increasing compared to first quarter and we believe utilization rates reached an inflection point during the quarter on a reported basis average corporate loans increased while ending loans decline reflecting an acceleration in ppp forgiveness late in the quarter through june approximately of total ppp loans have been forgiven and we anticipate that reaching approximately by yearend regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest ending growth in credit card however consumer loans continue to be negatively impacted by runoff portfolios and further pay downs in home equity overall we continue to expect fullyear adjusted average loan balances to be down by lowsingle digits compared to although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by lowsingle digits with respect to loan guidance and the rest of our expectations were not including any impacts from our pending enerbank acquisition so lets turn to deposits although the pace of deposit growth has slowed balances continue to increase this quarter to new record levels the increase is primarily due to higher account balances however as john mentioned were also producing strong new account growth we are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior and based on an analysis of pandemicrelated deposit inflow characteristics we currently believe between and of the deposit increases will likely persist on the balance sheet broadly speaking we think liquidity will normalize over time as the fed becomes less accommodative reductions in their asset purchases will mitigate future liquidity increases in the system which should curb further deposit growth lets shift to the net interest income and margin which remain a significant source of stability for regions pandemicrelated items continued to impact the nii and margin ppprelated nii increased million from the prior order cash averaged billion during the quarter and when combined with ppp reduced second quarter reported margin by basis points excluding excess cash and ppp our adjusted margin was evidencing active balance sheet management efforts despite a nearzero shortterm rate environment the 9basispoint linked quarter decline was mostly attributable to the purchase of billion of securities and one additional day in the quarter both of which support nii at the expense of margin similar to prior quarters the impact on nii from historically low longterm interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies a lower deposit cost and higher hedging income lower libor drove a million increase from loan hedges and at current rate levels we expect roughly million of hedgerelated interest income each quarter until the hedge has begin to mature in since the beginning of we have repositioned a total of billion of cash flow swaps and floors we do not currently expect any further repositioning however this is continually evaluated in the context of a dynamic balance sheet our current balance sheet profile allows us to support our goal of a consistent sustainable earnings growth specifically we are positioned to benefit from higher middle tenure interest rates and increases in shortterm interest rates in the future while protecting the nii stability to the extent the fed remains on hold longer than the market currently expects importantly the recent declines of longer maturity market yields have less of an impact on regions earnings potential as most of our fixed rate production has maturities of shorter than six years a point on the curve that on a relative basis has fallen less with respect to outlook we view the second quarters nii to be the low point for the year over the second half and beyond a strengthening economy a relatively neutral impact from rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive nii growth regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 before moving on i want to highlight slide through slide in the appendix which provides additional asset liability management information that we think will be helpful to investors now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income decreased from the prior quarter but reflects a increase compared to the second quarter of capital markets returned to a normal run rate after experiencing record results in the prior two quarters looking ahead we expect capital markets to remain a strong contributor generating quarterly revenue in the million to million range on average excluding the impact of cva and dva mortgage income decreased quarteroverquarter primarily due to the gain on sale compression and hedge performance particularly around timing and market volatility we believe pricing has stabilized and expects second half revenue to be fairly consistent with that recorded during the second quarter wealth management income increased quarteroverquarter reflecting strong production and favorable market conditions service charges also increased compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by three additional business days while improving we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting which we have highlighted in the appendix are likely to keep service charges below prepandemic levels we estimate service charges will grow compared to but remain approximately to below levels card and atm fees continue to benefit from increased economic activity in our footprint reflecting strong growth up compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by increased debit and credit card spend both now exceeding prepandemic levels given the timing of interest rate declines in combined with exceptionally strong noninterest income we expect adjusted total revenue to be stable to up modestly compared to the prior year but this will be dependent on the timing and amount of ppp loan forgiveness lets move on to noninterest expense while exceptionally strong performance particularly in credit is contributing to higher than anticipated other incentive compensation adjusted noninterest expenses decreased in the quarter driven primarily by lower capital markets incentive compensation payroll taxes and legal and professional fees partially offset by an increase in merit and marketing expenses we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business in we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up modestly compared to with quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses in the million to million range and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time from an asset quality standpoint we delivered strong performance as overall credit continues to perform better than expected reflecting broadbased improvement across most portfolios and recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values annualized net chargeoffs decreased basis points during the quarter to basis points nonperforming loans total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all improved during the quarter our allowance for credit losses declined basis points to of total loans and of total non accrual loans excluding ppp loans our allowance for credit losses was the decline in the allowance reflects better than expected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy the allowance reduction resulted in a net million benefit to the provision our allowance regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 remains above peer median as measured against period end loans or stress losses as modeled by the federal reserve future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of chargeoffs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery based on improved market conditions we now expect full year net charge offs to range from basis points to basis points with respect to capital our common equity tier ratio increased approximately basis points to an estimated this quarter and based on the recent stress test results our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement for the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of will be and our common equity tier operating range remains to with the goal of managing to the midpoint over time we repurchased million common shares during the second quarter however we are temporarily pausing further share repurchases until the expected enerbank closing date in the fourth quarter we anticipate being back in the market in the fourth quarter and expect to manage cet1 to the midpoint of our operating range by yearend also earlier this week our board of directors declared a increase to our quarterly common stock dividend to per share so wrapping up on the next slide are our expectations which weve already addressed in summary were very pleased with our second quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues pre tax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit quality is outperforming expectations capital and liquidity are solid and were optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp how are you matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good can you just remind us the impact of capital from the pending deal im just trying to think of the walk on cet1 from to by the end of the year david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i think you can matt its david you can the purchase price which is million and thats the capital were going to use well pick up a little bit of balance sheet and equity with that so i mean around that number call it billion which is round numbers about a point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just talk about some of the underlying loan demand that youre seeing you said some pockets of strength and obviously theres been some pickup in covid cases specifically in the southeast and have you seen any impact in terms of the behavior of that in recent weeks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so maybe ill start with the last question first in our markets when covid originally impacted the economy they were some of the last to close and the first to reopen and we really have seen the benefits of that with increasing economic activity in our markets we also are operating in markets that are some of the least vaccinated and so we have been at risk of some recurrence of covid the delta variant is having some impact on the population but weve not seen it necessarily impact the economy yet regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 loan growth has been broadbased were seeing increasing activity across virtually all of our markets growth has been across multiple segments whether it be the small business middle market large corporate and were growing in many of our specialized industries businesses like healthcare technology financial services transportation were seeing growth in assetbased lending and so our pipelines have definitely expanded as i think the point was made they exceed levels that we were experiencing at this same time in and the needs are to support ma activity to support shortterm working capital needs associated with the expansion in businesses growth in commodity prices and also increasingly some fixed capital investment which i think is a very good sign and frankly is a green shoot weve been looking for matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i should say on the just on as a followon the consumer side as well we obviously had good mortgage production we expect to begin to see some growth in card as the level of payments comes down and spend increases so that should be positive as well operator your next question is from jennifer demba of truist securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning question on expenses just wondering how much wage pressure youre seeing and how much youre seeing of potential poaching of your employees i know theres a big war for talent out there right now david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah jennifer its david so from an expense standpoint you could see our numbers were controlling that very well i think at the end of day as we manage our human capital its providing a great place to work and weve received a number of awards on that front were obviously in this transition period post or i guess still in the middle of a pandemic but starting to return to the office weve been working the whole time really providing some flexibility for our workforce so i think when you create opportunities like that you have to pay people fair market value and we think we do that and so we havent seen any big trends that have gone the other way but were cognizant of the fact that people have alternatives when were working in a remote environment and i think being able to adapt to that and have flexibility would be a way to deal with it so the answer i guess short answer is no we havent seen that yet regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc are you able to at this point are you able to quantify how much money you can save in the area of real estate by having a more flexible work environment or totally remote work environment for some of your employees david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp we could do some math around that jennifer but its probably a little premature to do so were working with a number of different opportunities so for instance in our contact center were remote and so the question is will that remain that way and if so does that affect space over the long haul thats just one example there are going to be a number of those i think we need to get a little more time under our belt certainly it leaves you to believe that in time our square footage ought to come down and but i just dont know that we can quantify that at this point jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay and one more question if i could on your newer branches you mentioned the amount of deposit growth youve seen from newer branches over the last few years what are the plans for new branches as you look ahead the next one or two years david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i think youre going to see us continue the trend that we have were going to consolidate branches when it makes sense were going to make investments in markets that we think where we build out our density and so youll continue to see some new branches the power of the new branches were really contributing disproportionately to our growth from those de novo branches but we also have to acknowledge the fact that we do have investments in digital that are important as well so i think as we optimize our branch footprint were going to look for consolidation opportunities where we can take twoforone or threeforone branch consolidation where it makes sense in a given market to be as efficient as we can while maintaining access for our customers but dont want to have them travel too far to our branches so were going to continue to optimize our retail network as you have seen us do over time jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 good morning john good morning david david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc david can you share with us when you think about you guys gave us some good data about the pressure that your liquidity is causing on your net interest margin even when you exclude the ppp loans can you share with us whats a reasonable amount of money or size i should say that that liquidity should be so much more are you carrying today than you would be comfortable with the way your balance sheet is shaped today and second how long you think its going to take for you to wean down to that level that you think is appropriate david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp let me start with the end the second part of the question so as the fed continues to be less accommodative i think that liquidity in the system will start to go the other way we didnt expect the growth we had this past quarter so it continues to come in and of course we have child care credits and things of that nature that will probably aid to the liquidity so were carrying on average about billion sitting at the fed earning basis points wed love to redeploy that in a more meaningful manner but sitting here where we are with the 10year and trying to invest in mortgagebacked securities is probably ill advised normally we had been to draw that number had been call it billion maybe billion in normal times so its a tremendous number we do think that the surge of deposits that weve had this year 30plus billion that we think to of that will persist on the balance sheet as weve mentioned and have a higher beta on it but nonetheless the question of timing really is centered on the economic recovery and what the fed does with its balance sheet in a lower rate environment more accommodation means deposits linger longer if in fact the economy continues to rebound and we get the virus under control and we start seeing a gdp growth and people putting their cash to work then maybe we see it run out a little faster so its just really really hard to tell gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and john you gave us some color about the outlook for loan growth maybe can you give us or elaborate a little further on that loan pipeline that you talked about can you share with us what the pull through rate is and i know in terms of the loan pipelines it can be as simple as your loan officers had a conversation with a potential client to somebody who has actually signed a contract with you guys and theres a line of credit established and therefore thats more likely to come through as a loan than the first contact so can you give us some color of the pipeline and how it looks compared to prior quarters and what do you think a pull through rate should be john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah a great question gerard and one i asked ronnie smith just a few weeks ago because a lot of the outcome is a function of how the loan officer or the relationship manager assesses the opportunity when they put regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 it in the pipeline the good news is that our probability pipeline were pulling through more than of the opportunities that we believe were going to win so one of the reasons you sense a little more confidence from us and our ability to grow is that we are seeing good opportunities and we believe at least to this point were winning most of those good opportunities when we believe we have an opportunity to do that so i feel good about pipeline management and the efforts that our teams are putting forth to win new opportunities gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc is the pipeline considerably higher in this quarter versus or or is it slightly higher john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp its a good bit higher than its slightly higher i guess than we began seeing some momentum build toward the end of the first quarter it is as i recall 30plus percent higher than it was this time two years ago gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning also on the loan front i wanted to ask about frontend production do you have some quantifications around how much that was up on a linkedquarter basis and then how much where it compares versus pre pandemic john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yes so new loan production in our corporate bank was up linkedquarter i dont have that number right in front of me but ill get it while were here on a twoyear lookback david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so the growth in total production john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp new production is what im referring to regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp its david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah total new and renewed was up but if you exclude ppp quarteroverquarter is up john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thats right david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and how that compared to prepandemic john well look that up as we go through the call and come back to you john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp indiscernible memory john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah no problem and one other thing on that topic and then i have one other followup is your line utilization at how does that compare to your normalized level john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp typically we run so and were basis points to basis points shy of where wed normally operate and 800basispoint differential means million million in loan growth john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay and then separately i know youve indicated your service charges could remain to below levels part of that is the overdraft dynamic can we just confirm your overdraft fees annually they total about million annually and then secondly where do you see that going as you see the continued change in behavior and maybe a little bit of governmental scrutiny around the overdrafts again regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah john so your number is reasonably close to that i think everybody sit around that number and our anticipation of all the things that weve done our anticipation of customer behavior our transparency were providing which is allowing customers to understand where they stand intraday on things that well post to their account the following night of a given day gives them more opportunities to take care of a negative account situation so weve tried to anticipate what all that is and our guidance on our service charge has been down it was down because of that it was down because we were doing things to help our customers we reduced our overdraft caps and things of that nature in a given day so now youve asked a question what could happen we dont know were trying to do what we think is the right thing and what the government or regulators do well have to adapt and overcome if theres any change at all so i think our to below prepandemic is our best answer at the moment john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and i think id just add john that as we have provided our customers more tools to better manage their finances weve seen nsf od fees decline over time so if you look back years and come forward to today theres been an over decline in nsf od fees that weve recognized so call that i guess on average about a year from customers just managing their finances better weve grown our customer base over that period of time so youd have to assume there are fewer incidences of nsfs and overdrafts and i think that that trend will continue and as david said were prepared for that through growth and other fees associated with growth in our business whether it be debit card transactions associated with a high level of debit card activation and growth in checking accounts growth in wealth management capital markets and other sources of mortgage other sources of fee income john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks for taking my questions john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning how are you doing regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good thank you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i wanted to dig in a little bit on the enerbank acquisition strategy i know that you have some nice slides in the back talking about what the activity is in your footprint could you give us a sense as to how the activity skews in the nonregions branch footprint and then what are you going to bring to this business how are you going to ramp this going forward john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so today we estimate the marketplace is about billion annual origination market across a couple of different categories of home improvement enerbank has been particularly active in hvac and pools have a growing presence in solar and we have been observing participating in indirectly to the pointofsale lending space for now six years or seven years and have aspired to have the opportunity to have an origination vehicle if you will we think enerbank provides that we built our consumer lending strategy around lending around the home if you will so weve been investing in mortgage were making some improvements in our equity loan and line products and we think enerbank is the third leg of that lending around the home do with a focus on home improvement and point of sale lending to the consumer in terms of what we bring we bring balance sheet enerbanks growth has been constrained to some extent by their willingness if you will the parent companys willingness to fund their growth and we of course have significant liquidity and a balance sheet and a desire to continue to grow that business we bring banking products and services to enerbanks customers which we think we can more broadly deliver and deepen those relationships which benefits enerbank as well and then which bring overall capacity and an existing customer portfolio that we think we can market in to across our footprint so we believe the combination really powerful we think we can be a nice asset for growth and a nice set of products to offer to our existing customers and at the same time a nice group of customers to sell our products into to meet enerbanks customer needs it should be a good combination david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well id add as it relates to production so of their production is in our existing footprint so is not and so were looking at continuing to build out and diversify throughout the country on this particular product one of the things that we bring that they did not have is as you know the yield is roughly with points and thats coming from the contractor or the dealer and the others is the customer and so if somebody takes out a loan and then refinances were going to be there thats going to be our customer now that we have a mortgage opportunity for so if that happens those fees get accelerated and so whereas enerbank would have received that they wouldnt have gotten the benefits of the mortgage were going to be able to get that and the fees so we just think its going to be very powerful regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 the last piece of this ill say is as john mentioned its a large industry but its incredibly fragmented where enerbank only represents of that production and we think over time were going to be able to penetrate this market much deeper than what theyve been able to do primarily because of our funding betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right i mean when you look at the filings it looks like they were selling out half of their originations historically and obviously youd be able to retain that david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the other question that i had is you mentioned that you are looking at more incremental ma opportunities and im wondering what gaps do you still have or what youre most focused on growing john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well we want to continue to add to some specific capital markets capabilities we have a very good mortgage servicing rights group and so were interested in potentially acquiring more mortgage servicing rights we want to continue to as david said potentially grow and expand what enerbank is doing were thinking wealth management theres some potentially some opportunities to gaining some additional capabilities there as well so fairly broadbased as we think about other opportunities to grow and diversify our revenue and to acquire capabilities to help us meet the customer needs betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the mortgage servicing rights piece how does that fit in to customer needs can you just give me the strategic bullet point on it john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well its a we think it just continues to support the capabilities that we have and it continues to drive efficiencies through that particular unit so its as much about benefits to the shareholder i guess as it is meeting customer needs betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks operator your next question is from ken usdin of jefferies regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys hey just a followup on the swap book david you said that you dont intend to making any other changes to the book as is and just wondering how you philosophically think about that against whats happened with the rate curve and the excess liquidity ill start with that david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah ken i think all the adjustments that we see right now weve made but that we also had a caveat in there that this is a pretty dynamic environment so as circumstances change well also adapt and overcome weve talked about we think theres a misunderstanding on our swap book we do have a long terms fiveyear terms on our swaps and as conditions change and we see an opportunity for rising rates then you would expect us to take off some of that protection that we have for the low rate environment so that we can benefit as rates rise so that being said we are naturally asset sensitive more so than many banks because of our deposit base and so the repositioning of moving those notional amounts to a different period of time to help protect us when the economy actually rolls over the other way and the fed becomes more accommodative so its very dynamic what we want to do is make sure we have an appropriate interest rate risk program that lets us benefit regardless of what the rate environment is and thats an everyday we have a whole group of people thats what they do every day and so weve made the changes we think necessary thus far but were going to continue to watch it kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood and just as a followup to that then david the million benefit run rate that you mentioned how far quarterly of a line of sight do you have on that level and when in does that start to drip a little bit as just the natural role i know obviously kept in concert with hopefully by then rates have gone up as an offset david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i mean thats the point im glad you mentioned that thats exactly the point were trying to make so if you just looked at the hedge benefit of million i think we have didnt we put that in the slide if we didnt do it this time we actually had a slide that show it drifting down lower as you go through but thats stat thats based on today over time that can change because if we reposition certain derivatives were not going to be benefiting from the derivative but well be benefiting because rates are higher on the rest of our loan portfolio the purpose of the hedge was to protect us not the dues nii and margin it was to protect us if rates stayed low which they have done and so when you think about giving up if you will benefit from our derivatives because either their term comes or we terminate them its because were winning on our whole portfolio that helps offset and then some for nii growth hopefully that makes sense regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc it does okay thanks for that david david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp let me go back to john pancaris question on loan production so john we if you go back to the second quarter of and you compare that production level to what we just had its a little over so a little bit more than double what that production was at that time so hopefully that gives you a little bit of context operator your next question is from bill carcache of wolfe research john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning john and david following up on your comments around the enhancements through your overdraft practices can you give a bit more color on whether youre combining those enhancements with a marketing message on your consumerfriendly practices so that hopefully those enhancements translate into greater retention and lower attrition john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp we are were reaching out to customers reaching out across our associate base making sure that everyone understands the benefits were providing and hopefully that translates into frankly customers beginning to increase the utilization of tools that were providing were not seeing early early were seeing some nice pickup and alerts as an example which i think is a key tool that customers can and will use to help them better manage their finances we should be introducing our bank on product its been approved and should be live sometime later this quarter and we think thats another enhancement that when combined with the other changes were making will send a real positive message to our customers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it separately followingup on enerbank can you give a bit more color on the crosssell opportunity across the 10000plus contractor network and sorry if i missed this but over time do you intend to extend the business model nationally outside of where enerbank originates loans today or is there a reason you need to stay closer to your indiscernible john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well i think theyre originating loans across the country today and we dont intend to change that the good news is that 55plus percent of their originations are in our footprint and that makes some sense when theyre financing regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 hvac and pools swimming pools youd naturally think that a good bit of that activity is going to occur in the southeast and so well continue to lean into that in terms of crosssell were just beginning to have conversations with the leadership team there about how well go about it but we have a similar effort underway if you will with ascentium capital and were already beginning to see the benefits of that activity so well have a template of sorts with what were doing with ascentium and their customer base that we think we can leverage into the relationship with enerbank bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc i see i think i may have misread on slide you guys have on the top right the originations ltm and there are several states where there arent any and so i just thought that that met only the ones that show i think i just may have misread that so they are john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc originating across the country john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah and its think about it just as a function of product so back to the three primary products being hvac pool and solar those are largely going to be products that get originated across the sunbelt and on the west coast bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and then lastly on ppp with the bulk of loans forgiven by the end of this year can you give any color on the extent to which you think ppp helped deepened the relationship with your customers that participated in the program beyond having provided support for them during the pandemic just curious whether you think theres any future benefit from those deeper relationships john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i do i mean i would say the customers that i run into that i mean that was such an incredibly stressful time for customers for bankers in the economy there was so much uncertainty and our ability to meet customer needs and to help almost customers receive a loan through the ppp program had a huge impact on customers and on their employees we think that we supported saving of over million jobs as a result of the loans that we made and so i think we did generate a good bit of additional loyalty good news is our loyalty scores are already very high amongst our consumer and small business customer base but i think our participation in the ppp program and the way we responded for customers ultimately did generate good bit of additional loyalty regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks very much for taking my questions john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks john and david i was curious if the enerbank deal would have been as attractive as the excess liquidity wasnt as high because the excess liquidity kind of help justify that transaction john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i think ill let david speak to the finances but just purely from a strategic perspective as i said earlier weve been participating through an indirect relationship actually two indirect relationships we had weve been participating in pointofsale or unsecured lending to consumers on an indirect basis largely to support home improvement not entirely and it has been our desire to find a way into that space as weve seen consumers migrate their borrowing from banks traditionally to these pointofsale lenders and so weve had an interest we also as i mentioned are focused on lending around the home and meeting customer needs through three different product channels first mortgage heloc heloan and then third this pointofsale lending activity so weve been looking and interested for some time and we think enerbank is a great opportunity for us really wellrun company we like the team and the relationships they have and so i believe it would have been just as interesting to us but david if you want to david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah financially it would the fact that we had idle cash is incrementally beneficial but we would have still done the transaction even with a debt financing i mean the return on capital return on investment that were going to experience and continuing to grow and we think that at the end of the day what our investors really want us to do with our business and the capital we generate instead of buying stock back and things of that nature is to invest in the business and grow and to make smart acquisitions where you get a disproportionate return and you creating a product capability to serve existing customers and grow new ones that you can crosssell to as we just talked about whether itd be the contractors or all the folks individuals that have loans so this was not done because of that it was independent regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thats helpful thanks for walking through that background i appreciate it david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your final question is from christopher spahr of wells fargo securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you good morning so first id like to give you commend you on actually your good digital disclosures its one of the best amongst all regional banks so my question is going to be techrelated so whats your outlook for your million tech budget given the opportunities to grow accounts and target specific customers as well as like optimizing your contacts that are remote i dont think theres any other bank thats like that and then second my followup would be at what point do these investments become selffunding and when do you expect to get there thank you john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well i will speak to the first part of the question im not sure about the selffunding i guess its our hope is over time as we make investments that the cost of computing comes down and were able to continually make investments we said were spending about million as you pointed out roughly of that is dedicated to cybersecurity and defending the bank and our customers approximately we said is dedicated to keeping the bank going to maintaining operations and support innovation and new ideas and were going to continue to make those investments and we believe through doing things like improving our mobile app through digitizing the account origination process through giving our bankers whether theyre in the branches or our commercial and wealth rms more digital tools to assist customers esignature capabilities across the footprint drives digital usage at the same time we want to make sure that were investing in capabilities that give customers more selfservice options that allow them to use all of our channels and have the same great experience whether theyre at an atm in a branch or using their mobile or online app or talking to the call center thatll be really important to us as we continue to try to meet customer expectations for convenience and speed of transaction and more selfservice options regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 so i think as we make those investments they create process improvements they help us drive efficiencies and effectiveness consistent with our desire to continuously improve and that generates more funding for a reinvestment in technology and innovation and we believe that that model and weve proven that that model works over the last threeplus years and we expect it will continue to work as an important part of our strategic plan david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah chris ill add i think so were spending of our revenue on technology we expect to grow revenue over time and as a result technology spend will increase youve asked a very good question and to the folks that work for regions i promise i didnt have chris plant this question because thats what we ask all the time is if were going to spend this kind of money where is our return when are you going to be on your own and thats hard to answer chris but certainly we challenge ourselves all the time to make sure every dollar that we spend is meaningful and that were not just spend in technology spend technology what benefit does our customer get and what benefit do our shareholders get from this spend and its a continual challenge and i think were in pretty good position for that but its hard to give indiscernible project exactly when thats self sustaining christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you very much john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thats it okay operator there are no other questions john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp great well ill just close by acknowledging the great work of our teams these are still somewhat uncertain times and i think our teams remain focused on the things that we can control particularly focused on taking care of our customers and i think that those benefits are beginning to appear in our results so i appreciate the work our teams have done thank all of you who participated today for your interest in
