management discussion section carlo pellerani group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc hello everyone welcome to the hsbc fixed income call for our fullyear results thank you for joining us im carlo pellerani group treasurer and im joined by richard oconnor global head of investor relations and greg case head of the investor relations as usual ill mention a couple of things in the results then a quick update on financial resources and finally well go into qa i will not be referencing any slide as we go through in terms of results i just would like to mention three points royalty for the year up on the back of higher nii and good cost control which more than offset a higher ecl charge we expect royalty to improve to about this year second in terms of balance sheet dynamics the reported loans and deposit numbers need to be read carefully because they include adjustments for the canadian and french sales and fx so if you exclude those loans actually decreased by billion only in the quarter and deposits were flat and then finally credit quality remains quite solid fullyear ecl charge equivalent to basis points of gross loans stage loans remain low at of total loans and at this stage we still see limited signs of deterioration in the loan book and we are flagging an ecl charge of around basis points for the year now on to financial resources starting with capital our cet1 ratio as you saw was which is 80basis point up in the fourth quarter thanks to profits and lower adjusted rwas we are now inside our cet1 target of to and percentage points above our nda requirements hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 second on liquidity it remains quite strong most importantly at the legal entity level but also reporting group lcr with total gross hqla of over billion our loantodeposit ratio is quite low at and hence we have a meaningful deposit surplus which positions us quite well in this high rate environment our mrel ratio is at which compares very favorably to our requirement we intend to continue to operate with a prudent buffer over that minimum from a funding perspective we expect to issue a similar amount of gross debt to the one we issued last year targeting billion to billion of holdco senior billion to billion in tier and about billion in at1s on legacy capital good progress in we reduced the ph stack by over billion we will continue to monitor the market for costeffective options to manage the stack down over time so in summary a good year the group now becoming very capitalgenerative our capital funding and liquidity positions leave us well placed to continue growing and we believe our business model offers bondholders one of the most diverse sets of revenue streams in global banking on that note lets open the call for qa ill hand over to greg question and answer section greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks carlo hi everyone as we did last time well be taking questions over zoom if you want to ask a question please can you raise your hand to signal that you want to ask a question and youll need to ensure your line is not muted when we come to you ill just give that one a minute to signal for questions and you can also ask the question via the chat function yeah so the first question comes from lee street from citi lee your line should be open lee we cant hear you sorry indiscernible move on to dan david from autonomous daniel david q analyst bernstein autonomous llp good afternoon all hopefully you can hear me greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah we can hear you thanks dan daniel david q analyst bernstein autonomous llp success great congratulations on the results and thanks for taking my questions i have three just wanted to touch upon the at1 call the dollar was this decision taken on an economic basis you mentioned before the call that the market wasnt pricing in the risk of extension and i guess if i look at your spreads today hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 and also your issuance plan versus your total calls this year it suggests that it could have been called outright similar to what youve done in previous years on the legacy could you just remind us of your priorities whether anything has changed there and then just focusing on the makewholes youve talked about economics there in the past as well im just wondering if you can provide a guide as to what sort of pl or cet1 impact youd be willing to book and i guess im looking at the exercises that youve done so far and kind of thinking of to points that youve kind of paid is that reasonable or should we expect that you can maybe take a larger hit as a result of the need to get rid of ph these securities and then finally just a quick one on libor do you intend to use the synthetic extension on your dollar discos post june thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc hi there thanks very much for the three questions on the at1 call to start yes the decisions that we make are on economic terms now the way that those economics are calculated are a little bit more complex than just calculating the pv of the transactions so broadly speaking what we do is we take into account three components one is the pv of a call versus those automatically reaching the full amount second what is the full amount that we need outstanding and whether were going to have a period of time or an amount outstanding to replace that call which is smaller and as a consequence there is a cost of carry that we are avoiding and third what is the impact on the future spreads and the issuance markets when you put all those things into account its a little bit of an art rather than a full science we put all those things together and we come up with the results and you saw on the back of that that we decided to call the transaction thats probably all i can say on that one in terms of legacy you might remember from previous calls that i described that i think of these in two dimensions there is a dimension which is how complex the securities are from a resolution perspective and on the second dimension is what is that call of taking those securities out so when you put all those two dimensions together we ended up with a pecking order that has broadly speaking four buckets the first bucket is the holding company ph near low securities those are in the first bucket because they are out of our resolution entity the holding company and there is a lack of ph contraction rights of recognition of the bank of england indiscernible rights so those are the first priorities second we have the ph hpe the nonringfenced bank fixed rates tier then we have the discos and then we have everything else so as you saw we progressed along the first two buckets last year and those buckets continue to be the most important and will progress down from that priority list third on synthetic libor all i would say is at this stage the consultation on synthetic libor hasnt concluded so well have to wait for that before we can do anything about it greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks dan and so weve got some questions in from lee ill just read them out as i think hes having some trouble joining so at first lee asks a high level question with all the changes in the business model in recent years which banks do we regard as our main peers additionally whats the plan for the billion of legacy hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 that loses capital value in and also linked to that should we assume that the billion to billion of tier will be a normal run rate over the next few years carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you thanks very much lee on the first question hsbc stands pretty much on its own in the type of business model that we have so we dont quite see ourselves having a very comparable peer around the globe what we do is we look at each of those markets and we compare ourselves versus more local peers with of course the caveat that the value of our franchise is actually international connectivity so its difficult pretty much to give you a few set of peers that you can compare us against in terms of the legacy securities losing value in what were doing is we are prefunding that those amounts over the next few years to avoid a big cliff risk in and thats incorporated into the million to billion that we are flagging for this year for tier and then on your third question looking forward and i would say this more broadly across all the components of the stack we are now more or less at a level where the distribution of the different components of the stack are pretty much where we think they should be and from this point we are about refinancing and financing growth so if you take the current amount of spending and you divide and in i dont know five to sevenyear average maturity you end up with an annual amount of issuance which is not that dissimilar to what we are doing this year and that includes also the tier so somewhere between lets say billion to billion on a stable basis every year richard do you want to comment anything else especially on the first question richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah on the peers lee its a very good question and clearly we can do benchmarking for example on uk ringfenced bank versus our big peer banks and ph we do say saying that well achieve it then saying this with friends in china and obviously in our home market hong kong versus other large hong kong banks but the short answer is at the group level theres no one indiscernible theres no one sort of a direct or totally direct peers in trade weve obviously got three or four banks who are also global but are much smaller than us were double size ph were number two for example in transaction banking its basically us and citi and then you go down to peers who are a lot smaller than us ph you wont see it yet but just so you youre aware the peer group for indiscernible purposes has changed this year and there are more asian peers within it so we have made a few changes to the peer group to basically make it more asiancentric as the center of gravity for the bank and moves more to asia so thats one account do you want to have a look at that greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah sure one last piece of lees question so he also asks as it relates to securities with liborbased coupons should we be expecting libor consent solicitations to be announced by june carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc so lee as we have said before we have no intention of leaving investors with libor risk without before offering them a modern alternative that is of course depending security by security when that impacts you in the case hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 of the discos specifically there is a more a closer timeframe for us to look at that so you should expect something imminent from us in terms of offering remediation for those the form of that offering is still under discussion we havent concluded what is but you should expect something imminent in that regard greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks for your question lee the next question is coming from rob smalley from ubs rob your line should now be open robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions and doing the call first on net interest margin developments weve seen and youre projecting continued strong growth in the margin even with a passthrough of an increase in rates could you talk about the development particularly hong kong versus the uk i think that some of your peers in the uk are seeing peak net interest margin now and where are you seeing growth in yours thats the first question second ukrelated again you have a lot of liquidity at the bank any other plans to deploy it in any other way i know that the easy answer is if we could we would have already but anything that changed there and then finally on the ecl charge million for mainland china million for the rest of the book could you talk about the methodology there whether theres more whether theres idiosyncratic risks in there how much of that is modeldriven and how you came to that number thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks thanks rob thanks for the questions so lets start with nii so as you saw we had nii for q4 of billion if you annualize that number it gives you about billion of nii we had a lot of questions earlier today as to what should be our guidance of nii for the full year and what we have said is we havent changed our guidance what we are saying is that we are flagging more than billion of nii for the way we think about it is there are a few tailwinds and there are a few headwinds on the tailwind side we have still a component of the rates that havent repriced the rates that we have seen so far that havent repriced yet in our books so thats a tailwind there are some potential additional rate moves that are still in the tailwind and fx calculations gives us about billion upside versus when we flagged that more than billion conversely there are a few headwinds the headwinds are potential increases in passthroughs our pass through so far have been inside the longterm averages were expecting from this point on the pass throughs to start to become closer to which implies more than from this point on an additional tailwind an additional headwind is also on the migrations of clients from savings accounts to time deposit that is particularly relevant in the hong kong market which is extremely competitive much less so in the uk market so when you put all things together we end up with a guidance that we provide at least billion and more than billion for the year in terms of the uk the uk market is theyre starting to see some sign of competition in the uk market but is still far from what we see in hong kong so at the moment were quite confident with the guidance that we have given hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 in terms of liquidity indeed we are a bank that ends up having a lot of liquidity what we have done over the last few years is we have become very deliberate about our liquidity management which clearly is helping us in this off cycle having surplus liquidity in this increasing rates environment is a competitive advantage but broadly speaking we created a framework to look at surplus liquidity in each of the entities that looks at what the liquidity should be and then we look at what the surplus in each of the entities is and then we lay out a framework that looks at how we deploy that liquidity how do we invest that liquidity or how do we reduce it if deploying and investing are not appropriate deploying is about business opportunities investments are at the margin if you have the liquidity what you can do without increasing the risk profile for the bank and then reduction is about offering different products to our clients and potentially finding intercompany solutions so we put all those things together we are quite active i would say given the current rate environment the reduce dimension has become less of a priority than it was when we started this a couple of years ago richard do you want to cover china richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah the additional charges you expect is on a bottomup basis but youre right to some extent the million on china cre is based on a sort of bottomup view of our particular borrowers and their particular situation and circumstances and then clearly we then look at it at an overall provision coverage level is that sensible what are whats the downside scenario what are what our peers doing and so as we said morning were comfortable with that charge as of december and we also said that the situation in that sector has improved since the yearend its still very early days i think theres still a lot to work through but i think youve seen positive developments in the last couple of months whereas in q4 you did see some deterioration so it still were still very ph much around that sector but more positive the rest of ph the world not much to say really bps broadly spread uk a pretty normal charge mexico pretty normal charge those are our big big books again broadly split between retail and wholesale no big tall reason there or no big sort of overlays or indiscernible adjusted for economic guidance adjustment so a pretty standard quarter for the book outside the china cre million charge which we called out separately robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc so can we assume that the goforward ecl from a modeldriven basis without anything idiosyncratic should be in around basis points over the next several quarters richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc well we got it to bps and then as you know our sort of guidance range if you like is bps to bps so were at the top end of that range that reflects difficult sort of economic circumstances at the moment with high inflation and so on and so forth some company going from cash flow difficulties staying in the retail sector so thats the reason why we struck it at the top end of the range obviously china cre as we mentioned already has weve been making ph trillions there over the last months or so so bps to bps is our guidance range and for now indiscernible the top of that range given our caution early in the year and given the difficult economic circumstances which much of the world is has found itself in the last few months hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thank you carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks rob greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc so weve got some more questions submitted over chat so from rob thomas at t rowe price and rob asks outside of china cre are there any areas of particular concern that youre monitoring closely and also can you update on the progress of the sale of the canadian business how is this transaction to occur and whats the timing richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc on the first look as youd expect our two big books are booked in hong kong and the uk clearly in hong kong its the hong kong booked china cre which ph has been an issue the book outside of that has been very very very solid and remains so during and so clearly ph it was where it was it works when the market is a big market for us ph it has own economic difficulties in the last year ph it actually worked it seems to be coming out of those difficulties with reopening pretty strongly albeit its still early days there but certainly all the signs positive in terms of hong kong recovery during and beyond ph and our other book is the uk and again its really we watch them on small businesses and small and midsized companies ph the mid sector who some of whom have cash flow difficulties as youre aware a fair chunk of the small business market is government guaranteed and but even there were obviously watchful so those are the areas where ph were watchful elsewhere in the world i suppose its idiosyncratic risk particular ph company in a particular sector you can get one or two of those each quarter but i would say those are the major points which were watching at the moment in terms of canada nothing to add to we only just announced it a month or two ago were working through the regulatory process as you would expect and thats on track with nothing more to say i would expect us to give you a more fulsome update on where were on the process probably at the half year we do we continue to think that it will take much of to ph work for all the various regulatory and other process weve got to work with greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks for the questions rob and another question submitted via text is coming from paul fennerleitão from socgen i think paul weve covered your first question but on the to set the other two specifically on the stage a big jump in total balances but no change in provisions why is that and also what can we expect for the remainder of the year ph or most its the jump is in retail but you would have thought that corporates would have been the most volatile in stage balances hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean the methodological change on uk mortgages nothing to flag its just a methodology change uk mortgages ph do perform well for us indiscernible explained ph in the board of accounting in more detail its more of a technical change ph than anything else wouldnt flag anything there particularly ph you know were more or less concerned what ph booked entities worked very for us and nothing much to say again in stage in wholesale obviously youve seen some of the china cre book go from stage to stage during particularly in q4 but also some in q3 as well but nothing else to call out there in terms of anything more than normal quarterly volatility in the wholesale stage area greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc all right and thanks for those questions paul just a reminder if you do want to ask a question over the phone please do raise your hand otherwise we have some more questions submitted over text from ellie dann at morgan stanley ellie i think weve answered a couple of the questions that you submitted but theres a couple here that we should cover so ellie says i notice that your at1 issuance plan is billion and is less than total redemptions for all the at1 calls you have this year given youve been operating above the official at1 level ph of regulators ph i think that you should reduce your at1 bucket in calling all of those and not replacing carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc hi ellie thanks thanks for the question yes the answer is yes the reason an at1 bucket specifically in terms of regulatory requirements right there is a tier bucket so we look at the tier in totality where the amount of tier that were issuing this year in comparison to the calls is in the part of plan to normalize the total amount of the at1 stack to the levels that i flag we think we are comfortable with so yes we are comfortable with that and also the discussion with the regulators is consistent with that greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc and then i think it looks like the last one from ellie as well does the sale of the canadian operations free up some cash for the redemption of legacy securities trading above par carlo pellerani a group treasurer general manager hsbc holdings plc we thats a creative connection between one area and another which we dont quite connect at all the way we think about the canadian proceeds is priority one is to pay an extraordinary dividend that we are foreseen to be after that its going to be a combination of additional buybacks and investment for growth we havent quite decided what the proportion of the last two are thats the way were thinking about it greg case headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 21feb2023 perfect okay so well that wraps up the call so thank you very much everyone for dialing in and for your questions and please do let us know by the usual channels if you have any
