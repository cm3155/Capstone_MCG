steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning and thanks for joining us as you saw in our earnings release issued a short time ago we reported strong second quarter results and raised our eps guidance for the fullyear based on the continued momentum were seeing in our core business revenue in the quarter reached an alltime high and earnings grew year overyear or after excluding the gain of we realized from the sale of accertify the strong performance of our core business yeartodate and our expectations for the balance of the year will enable us to increase our investments in marketing and other strategic areas that drive our growth without using any of the proceeds from the accertify sale while still delivering exceptional earnings results in fact we now expect to invest around billion in marketing this year up about million versus last year all of it funded from the results of our core business as a result we are raising our eps guidance range for the fullyear to to up from to previously and we continue to expect revenue growth in line with our to range for the year as we seen through the first half of the year our core business continues to generate strong momentum even against the backdrop of a slower growth environment the continued momentum were generating reflects the earnings power of our business model which is driven by several interrelated factors including first and foremost the quality of our loyal premium customer base plus the increasing scale of our business a wellcontrolled american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 expense base the success of the strategic investments were making to enhance amex membership and our talented colleagues around the world our continued strong performance starts with our premium customers who are highspending long tenured and have excellent credit profiles and we continue to attract large numbers of highquality premium customers with our superior products as seen in the consistently strong new account acquisitions and consecutive quarters of doubledigit growth in card fee revenue weve delivered next is scale over the past few years the scale of our business has grown significantly compared to yearend revenues have grown by nearly card member spending has increased by almost cardsinforce globally have risen by around million or about and a number of merchant locations on our network has grown by over million or nearly this increased scale drives growth and gives us significant flexibility in running our business for the longterm at the same time our operating expenses are growing wellbelow revenues as we drive efficiencies across the business the combination of our increasing scale and a wellcontrolled expense base produces significant operating leverage that generates more investment dollars we can inject into our business another key factor driving our momentum is the success of the strategic investments weve been making in critical areas like marketing value propositions technology control management capabilities and talent to sustain our growth and to keep the momentum going were continuing to invest in enhancing our unique membership model through ongoing product innovations and new capabilities and benefits for example as we execute our strategy of regularly refreshing our products we focused on embedding additional value in our premium cards to make them highly attractive to customers across generations and geographies this enables us to add large numbers of new premium card members to our customer base drive greater engagement with existing customers and price to the value we add we are on track to refresh approximately products globally by the end of the year as part of that number we look forward to announcing our refreshed us consumer gold card in the coming weeks adding to the nearly two dozen refreshed and updated products weve announced through the first half of the year we also continue to add new capabilities and benefits through both internal innovation and bolton acquisitions for example our resi dining reservation platform has seen significant growth since its acquisition in and our planned acquisitions of tock and rooam will further expand our dining portfolio giving our customers access to more great restaurants and increasing the digital offerings we provide to restaurants and merchants in the food and beverage industry finally our talented colleagues across the company are the engine that drives our growth their creativity determination and deep commitment to providing the best customer experience every day is what has made american express what it is today and will continue to make us successful in the future the combination of all these factors is what drives our premium business at a scale that can deliver superior earnings on a sustainable basis the power of our unique business model and the ongoing momentum were seeing in the business driven by our loyal customers and dedicated colleagues gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our expectations for the year and our longterm aspiration for the business with that ill now turn it over to christophe american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 christophe le caillec chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our second quarter results which reflect another quarter of strong performance starting with our summary financials on slide second quarter revenues were billion and grew year overyear on an fxadjusted basis net income was billion in the quarter generating earnings per share of our second quarter results also reflect the sale of our accertify business which closed during the quarter we recognized an aftertax gain on the sale of million equating to of eps impact excluding this gain eps grew reflecting power of the business to generate stronger earnings growth even in a slower growth environment as steve noted on slide billed business grew versus last year on an fxadjusted basis reflecting stable growth and in line with a softer spend environment weve seen in the past few quarters the stability in spend growth was also visible by category where we saw growth in goods and services growth in travel and entertainment spending we did see some slower growth in certain te categories versus the prior quarter such as in airline and lodging at the same time growth in our largest te category restaurants remained strong and goods and services strengthened a bit versus the prior quarter when excluding the impact of leap year stepping back while spend growth in certain categories was slightly higher or lower versus the prior quarter overall spend growth was stable and we continued to see strong growth in the number of transactions from our card members which grew this quarter there are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses starting with our largest segment on slide us consumer grew billings at this quarter with balanced growth across both goods and services and te our premium customer base continues to demonstrate steady growth we also saw growth across all generations millennial and gen z customers grew their spending and continued to drive our highest billed business within this segment this younger card members continue to demonstrate strong engagement and we see that they transact over more on average than our older customers and in some categories like dining they transact almost twice as much turning to commercial services on slide overall growth came in at this quarter spending growth from our us small and medium enterprise customers increased a bit sequentially versus last quarter but remained modest lastly on slide we see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services up we continued to see doubledigit growth in spending from international consumers and from international sme and large corporate customers and we are also seeing doubledigit growth across all regions stepping back we continue to see stable spend growth across customer segments spend categories and our us and international geographies and while we are not in a highgrowth spend environment particularly in the us our spending volumes are tracking in line with our expectations and support our revenue expectations for the year american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide we saw yearoveryear growth of demonstrating strong growth but continuing to moderate as expected as we progress through we expect loan growth in particular to continue to moderate by a few percentage points but still growing double digits as we exit the year turning next to credit and provision on slide through our credit performance remains very strong and is a direct result of our disciplined growth strategy which has been focused on growing our high credit quality premium customer base including through the younger customers we attract to the franchise this strategy coupled with our robust risk management practices are an important aspect of our business models going forward we expect our writeoff rates to remain generally stable for the remainder of turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide the quarteroverquarter reserve build of million is mostly driven by growth in our loan balances largely offset by lower delinquencies this reserve build combined with net writeoffs drove billion of provision expense in the second quarter as you see on slide we ended the second quarter with billion of reserves representing of our loans and card member receivables a slight decrease compared to q1 its worth noting that there is a seasonality component to reserves although we are also encouraged by the strength of the performance we see in the portfolio moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear benefiting from the diversification across revenue streams customer segments and geographies looking at the components of our revenue our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide this growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide were now generating over billion in quarterly card fee revenue as the differentiated value and experiences we offer on our products continues to resonate with our card members globally this is an important metric for us because it also reflects the choice that our customers make each year to renew their membership were pleased with the growth and expect to exit the year with further momentum in the quarter we acquired million new cards demonstrating the demand were seeing for our products and the investment weve made acquisition of our premium feebased products continue to account for around of new accounts and importantly as weve increased the total number of cards acquired we have maintained discipline underwriting standards moving on to slide net interest income was up yearoveryear this growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances which also contributes to the continued net yield expansion versus the prioryear as weve shared before we continue to expect this growth to further moderate as we progress through the year to sum up revenues on slide the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum even in a slower growth environment as our results in this quarter were fueled by growth in all our major revenue lines across each of our different business segments and across geographies moving to expenses on slide starting at the top of the page variable customer engagement expenses came in at of the total revenues for the second quarters looking forward i expect variable customer engagement expenses as a ratio to revenues to be in line with this level for the balance of the year on the marketing line we continue to invest at an elevated level at billion in the second quarter given the strong performance in the american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 core business we now anticipate our fullyear marketing spend to be around billion or higher versus last year as we plan to invest at high levels to sustain our growth momentum to put this in perspective this is an incremental million above what we spent in at the same time we intend to deploy those investments in a disciplined way as i discussed at investor day our investment optimization engine is engineered to make profitability based decision at the margin and theres a high bar for returns on these substantial incremental investments moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses operating expenses were billion in the second quarter down versus last year due to the million pretax gain we recognized from the sale of our accertify business excluding the gain operating expenses were up in the quarter wellbelow the pace of revenue growth even as we continue to invest in technology and our control management capabilities excluding the impact of the accertify gain we continue to expect operating expenses for the year to be fairly flat to this quarters results demonstrate how the scale of the business and strong expense discipline enable us to generate significant efficiencies and those efficiencies are enabling us to invest at elevated levels while still generating significant levers to drive strong earnings growth turning next to capital on slide our cet1 ratio was at the end of the second quarter within our target range of to we also returned billion of capital to our shareholders including billion of share repurchase this is the highest level in over two years and the recent ccar results further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and the resilience of our business model the stress test results show that under severely adverse scenario our portfolio remains profitable in fact we are the most profitable financial institution as a percentage of asset growth across all the banks subject to ccar and have the lowest credit card loss rate under stress as well this results in our stress capital buffer remaining at the lowest prescribed level we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth we do not expect any material nearterm changes to our capital management approach this brings me to our guidance on slide let me step back and make a few observations about the growth in the business and the way we see the balance of the year unfolding first we have a core business that is comfortably generating midteens eps growth even in a slower growth environment and before the gain from the accertify sale second the pace of earnings generation in the core business combined with a strong demand we are seeing in the market for our products is enabling us to invest around more compared to marketing last year as a result we are able to fund significantly more investments from our core business than our expectation at the start of the year without relying on the oneoff gain from accertify with that as steve mentioned we are raising our guidance for eps for the year to a range of to and within that range we now expect to drop all of the accertify gain to the bottom line this is a departure from our usual practice of reinvesting a significant portion of one off gains in growth initiatives but were confident in the ability of our business to support the yearoveryear growth of around million in marketing while delivering midteens eps growth finally we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the year in line with our initial to range with that ill turn the call back over to kartik to open up the call for your questions american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 kartik ramachandran senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you christophe before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is coming from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc good morning steve good morning christophe stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc steve can you maybe expand on what youre seeing in the us consumer and sme us consumer we saw a little bit of a slowdown from eight to six are you seeing a broader slowdown in the consumer and maybe just talk about where youre seeing on a samestore sales basis and then on the sme side you obviously saw a slight uptick so maybe if you could just expand on those both thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so i think look in us consumer you saw a little bit of a sequential decline but also remember last quarter we had the extra day so its not really applestoapples but listen the us consumer was up for the quarter continued to be strongly influenced by millennial and genz growth its now up to of our total billings and theyre up and so we feel good where the us consumer is obviously organic spending wed like to see a little bit higher but it is a slower growth economic environment but one thing i will point out before touching on sme you know when our consumer a lot of their spending is discretionary and for our consumer if they decide theyre going to pullback theyll pullback a little bit on discretionary but theyll continue to pay their bills which is why our credit numbers continue to be so strong and we continue to widen the gap between us and our competitors so we feel that look the us consumers been pretty consistent and we think its going to be pretty consistent throughout the year american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 from a small business perspective while there still is an organic decline yearoveryear that organic decline is less than it was last quarter and the quarter before that so were seeing slight improvement in both the us consumer and in small business retention is still strong and acquisition is still strong and so what i like about where were sitting is as the economy rebounds whenever that may be organic will pick up driving future growth and then just the last comment on international you didnt ask about it because probably it did so strong its up in the quarter and even small business and commercial within international is up so we feel good about where we are right now operator thank you the next question is coming from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes can you talk a little bit i know youre reiterating your revenue guide for of to but just given the results do you think youre sort of more leaning towards the mid to lower end and then can you talk about where youre investing in marketing in terms of us consumer commercial and international stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so i think look quartertodate were at about both reported and fx and for the quarter we were at and so i think were going to wind up within that range and i think depending upon how organic either rebounds or stays where it is will determine where we wind up within that range but were very comfortable with sort of the to as far as investment what we do is we will look at the myriad of opportunities that we have to acquire more cardholders and depending upon at any given point in time because our acquisition engine is a very dynamic engine and things change all the time we will allocate those investments either us consumer small business or international traditionally the us consumer business would get more of that investment followed either by international and small business but as i sit here today its hard to say exactly what percentages will be but it will be focused on acquiring more cardholders and the key about that is is that when we acquire cardholders in the second half of the year its really not going to drive spending for us this year it will what were doing here is were investing for the medium and the longer term and itll acquire cardholders that will spend for us next year so i think the takeaway from the point that christophe made and the point that i made is the business is so we feel the business is strong right now that were able to invest more and we have line of sight into those opportunities without compromising on credit christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co the only thing i will add to that don is that the revenue growth was exactly as we were expecting it to be and as we talked about it on the q1 call we talked about stable billings which is exactly what we got we talked about card fee remaining in terms of growth where it was in q1 before picking up a bit of momentum in the balance of the year we still think that its the right way to think about card fees and we talked about nii growth rate moderating a little bit so that revenue growth is where we thought it would be operator thank you the next question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning steve i think i heard you say a gold card refresh will probably be announced shortly i guess just can we contextualize what that means i assume it probably helps card fees next year and then just the spend trends intraquarter were those pretty stable it sounds like they were but just clarifying stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so im not going to get into the details of the card but what i would say is one of the big advantages of the refresh is is it makes the marketing dollars work a lot harder right so what happens is when you do a product refresh whether its gold whether its delta whether its hilton or whether its another gold or platinum card that we do internationally what happens is youre able to provide more value to those cardholders that already have the product you may be able to upgrade a green to a gold and obviously youre able to acquire even new cardholders with that and what happens is as you go out and acquire new cardholders youll have buzz around the fact that we have a new card and it has obviously a different value proposition and youll have the marketing that goes with it and so when you do a refresh and you have your marketing spend your marketing dollars work a little bit the overall value proposition is a lot stronger and it works a little bit harder for you christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co and when it comes to the intraquarter billings we typically dont talk about those and theres nothing much to say here so theres nothing noticeable in terms of monthly billing growth operator thank you the next question is coming from craig maurer of ft partners please go ahead craig maurer q analyst ftp securities llc yeah good morning thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask about the marketing spend and it seems like youre putting the pedal down so typically when american express does this its because or at least in the past youre seeing this happen because amex is either anticipating or already seeing a slowdown from competitors in terms of their market activity and you see a significant opportunity to gain share is any of that thought process going into this here and second business development costs were lower than what was being forecast so im curious if thats due to some slower partner growth that might have meant less incentives or what went into that thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so a couple points i think billion for the year in total marketing is not an area weve ever been in before and million yearoveryear increase is a pretty significant increase i think that when we make a decision craig to put more marketing dollars in its because we see the opportunity and if you look at where we have been from a marketing spend for the first two quarters that would show a trajectory of billion so were really keeping all of our marketing spending consistent quartertoquarter because we do see the opportunity and we see the opportunity within the credit box and within the dimensions of who were looking for for our cardholders american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 its not due to a were not making this investment because of a slowdown in billings this was something that we had planned to do at the beginning of the year where billings were where they werent going to be and as far as competitors pulling back i dont see competitors pulling back at all i think competitors right now the environment is just as competitive as its ever been obviously you make these investments because obviously you want to gain more traction with your cardholders and you want to gain more share christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co craig let me add a few things and i will also answer your question about business development expenses so the other element here to factor into the decision to invest more is the visibility we have in the balance of your performance the business is generating a lot of earnings we have more visibility in terms of the credit performance in the balance of the year in terms of the opex as well and that gives us confidence in our ability to actually deploy more marketing dollars and to get to your question about business developments its expenses theres nothing here significant there was in the quarter some efficiencies i will use that word in terms of the commercial spend and the incentives that we have with some card members and partners here and it gave us a bit of efficiency but there was nothing related specifically to core brand partners or anything of that nature operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my question and i apologize i cant see my computer this morning so its a little hard to get context on the marketing spend but what im trying to understand is the following what ive heard is that given the strength of the underlying business the incremental marketing spend is going to be funded organically as opposed to from the accertify gain what im wondering is that million yearoveryear has that changed materially from your prior guidance have you in fact increased your expectations and funded it organically or is it roughly the same and its just a matter of how youre going to pay for it christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah let me take that question and i hope you fix your computer problem soon the way to think about this is we always so we enter the year thinking we want to invest and we want to invest more because we see the opportunities and they are compelling investments with attractive returns the fact of the matter is that their core business which i would define as like the business excluding the accertify gain is generating more earnings that we had anticipated so youre right we can afford to spend more and to fund it through the core business but on top of that we also raised a little bit of our marketing dollars now its not a significant amount as weve said in the past in a given week we spent million on average of marketing dollars so or a bit more a bit less is actually not that material but the key thing here is that in terms of the funding its going to be funded all from the core business and because its generating more earnings that we had anticipated at the beginning of the year operator thank you the next question is coming from jeff adelson of morgan stanley american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning steve and christophe just wanted to revisit the credit quality a little bit i know last quarter christophe you were talking about your expectation for writeoffs to kind of continue ticking up from here and it seems like your view has now shifted to a more stable outlook over the rest of the year can you just maybe talk about what youre seeing from your core customers maybe whats driving some more confidence in the outlook there and then should we also be thinking about a stable reserve rate from here versus i think you were talking about more of an uptick over the rest of the year as well previously thank you christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah good morning jeff so youre right we have changed a little bit the way we think about credit writeoffs for the balance of the year and we are at the beginning of q3 now we had good visibility in terms of whats going to writeoff in q3 and q4 so we can be more confident in terms of providing a direction here and to your point the direction were providing now is that its going to be like stable at about level you saw in q2 at around now i need to say this specifically to address your question on the reserve and how to think about it for the balance of the year a big driver of the reserve is going to be the delinquency levels right those card members that are showing signs of and signals of stress early on the delinquency improvement in the quarter there is seasonality in that improvement right and so we expect either the delinquency rate is just going to probably tick up a bit in the balance of the year and that will drive a bit of incremental reserve together with the volume growth that we expect to see but from a reserve rate standpoint we are its a good reference point for what to expect for the balance of the year it might increase a little bit well see its hard to predict where cecl is just going to land exactly at the end of q4 but its a good guide in terms of what to expect for the balance of year i would expect maybe to but were going to be in that range and to your point credit losses we expect stability from where we are now for the balance of the year operator thank you the next question is coming from mark devries of deutsche bank please go ahead mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks as i think you pointed out it is pretty unusual for you to let a gain like the accertify gain fall to the bottom line and i realize you dont give guidance but steve just kind of wondering if youre still expect a target that midteens eps growth off this higher eps level stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well im actually glad you asked that question because it is a onetime gain and so as we do give guidance for next year we certainly do expect to be in that midteens eps range however we will be and wed expect that people would adjust for that onetime gain i think by calling out that onetime gain the way that we have and not using it within the business i think it makes your job a little bit easier to just sort of remove that and then build from there because when you look at it its a onetime gain thats why they call it a onetime gain but the thing that i would also point out is that because we have elevated our marketing spending to where it is using the core business and not use the onetime gain that gives us the opportunity to actually reset our marketing at a much higher level for next year which will allow us to drive even more growth as we go forward so american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 thats the big advantage that we look at this by not using a onetime gain and saying hey look thats what we didnt have in our core by adjusting up our marketing by using core earnings your anticipation is well be able to keep that marketing there and grow from there going forward versus going back to the billion operator thank you the next question is coming from cris kennedy of william blair please go ahead cristopher kennedy q analyst william blair co llc good morning thanks for taking the question at the investor day digital banking was one of the key areas of investment over the next couple of years can you just talk about those investments and what the goal is there stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah look the overall goal is to be more engaged with both our small businesses and to be more engaged with our consumers and i think digital banking is a bit of a journey for us we now have multiple accounts and were just going to continue to invest not only in capabilities but continue to invest in making sure that our customers are using that so therell be more to come on that but were at the beginning of this journey and theres still a long way for us to go operator thank you the next question is coming from terry ma of barclays please go ahead terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc hey thanks good morning just want to get some more color on how your announced product refreshes are going in terms of just acquisitions retentions and just overall receptiveness and whether or not you still feel pretty good about having net card fees exit the year higher than last year stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co in terms of acquisition or the product refreshes terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc in terms of just overall how product refreshes are going and whether or not you still feel pretty good about having net card fee growth exit the year stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah yeah the net card fee christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so we feel very good about adding a bit more momentum as we said in terms of the card fee growth we are at like fxadjusted and we are definitely expecting this to pick up a bit in the balance of the year its on the back of the product refreshes but not only on the back of product refreshes i mean the singlemost american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 important as i said in my prepared remark here singlemost important element of that is the renewed commitment that card members tenured card members in the portfolio make every year to actually renew their membership right thats a super important element of the mix here but card refreshes were on track we talked about products and we are tracking well against that and as steve said gold is next to come stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean were about halfway through on those product refreshes gold is the next big one to come and its really a little bit too early to tell how each one individually has done but what you look at is million cards million cards acquired and retention rates are still strong and those are the things that you look at but well be able to have more color as the year goes on operator thank you the next question is coming from saul martinez of hsbc please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hey good morning guys so a question on your eps guide the midpoint of your guidance range implies an eps in the second half that at the midpoint of the range suggests around growth i think at the higher end its a little under now obviously the higher marketing explains the bulk of it if not all of it but just wanted to ask is there anything else there that is relevant that we should be thinking about driving that deceleration and maybe different than what you had anticipated because obviously on a core basis your numbers stripping out accertify have been better than expected in the first half yet on a core basis kept eps guide unchanged and on that second half outlook i think you have said in the past correct me if im wrong that card fee acceleration ends the year closer to i dont think youve given a specific number on this call other than to say you see some acceleration but is still the bogey there thanks christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so we havent given a number and ive got to stick to that but your math is weve done the math as well and were looking at those numbers and you need to factor as well into account the fact that last quarter we had like about million of oneoff gain as well you might remember linked to the urr model but as you think about the balance of the year there are a couple of additional items to bake into your forecast the first thing is that as i said it was from a previous question i think it was from jeff we expect to build some balances in the balance of the year for credit reserves cecl reserve and so that will put a bit of pressure on the eps the second thing is that opex were investing in technology as i said in my remarks as well were investing in our control management capabilities and typically as well as the seasonal factor at american express weve seen operating expenses pick up a little bit towards the end of the year so when you bake all of this into account including a bit more marketing that we are projecting at this point in time in the balance of the year you actually get back on your feet and youll see that the eps cadence or run rate is actually not moving that much and remains like very high operator thank you the next question is coming from moshe orenbuch of td cowen please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc great thanks and is there like indiscernible as you look at the net interest income that did decelerate about six points in the quarter from the first quarter level but still the growth rate of nii is still well above the growth rate in loans as you kind of approach the end of the year do you think that those two kind of converge or will there be margin pressure and could that net income interest growth be lower than the growth in balances by then christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co thank you for your question moshe there are a couple of things to keep in mind here the first one is that as ive said we should expect the volume the balances the loans to growth rate to moderate a bit further in the balance of the year although it will remain in doubledigit from a yield standpoint we have a slide that shows the yield we had a bit of a yield improvement on the back of i would say a few things yearoveryear yield improvement on the back of the revolve rates are a bit higher and they keep ticking up a little bit and the second thing is and as we covered during the investor day on the funding side we still have this dynamic around a bigger share of our funding mix going to high yield savings accounts which for us is an effective funding channel and so that dynamic is still going to play out in the balance of yearend so you should expect to see the nii growth rate kind of like moderate a bit in the balance of year operator thank you our final question will be coming from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my question wanted to go back just staying on spending and revenue is it fair to say that youre planning for the softer spending environment to continue for the next couple of quarters so discount revenue growth will be at current quarter levels probably a fair way to think about it or are you thinking any change in that trajectory and then just relatedly on spending if i could just if you could just tell us what happened in large and global spend it looked like it decelerated a fair amount so is there anything to call out there i mean i know its a smaller business but so fairly meaningful deceleration christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so let me take the first one around how were thinking about billing so we are as i said we see a lot of stability across the last two three quarters and even a bit further when you look at this in detail so from our guidance standpoint when we developed the guidance and the revenue guidance thats what we bake in if there is upside to that spend level then its going to be a good thing for us but from a guidance standpoint thats what we are assuming on the revenue side when it comes to global and large last quarter you remember there was like a tick up it was at this quarter there was back to that there are a few things here like theres really nothing meaningful outside of like we noticed in one specific client or a significant drop in terms of their card member usage but there is nothing really material there not big change not an inflection point in terms of what we see in terms of corporate card spend kartik ramachandran senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 donna after you all
