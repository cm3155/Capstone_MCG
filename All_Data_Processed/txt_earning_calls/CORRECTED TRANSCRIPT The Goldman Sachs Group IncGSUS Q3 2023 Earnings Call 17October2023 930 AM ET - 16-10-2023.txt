may begin your conference david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you very much and good morning everybody thank you all for joining us before i start my prepared remarks id just like to take a moment to address the horrific events in the middle east we condemn the terrorist attacks against israel on the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss of so many innocent lives this is clearly an extremely difficult and uncertain time for the region and its very concerning for many of us around the world we obviously will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds earlier this month i marked the end of my fifth year as the ceo of goldman sachs ive never felt more optimistic about the firm and our strategy has never been more clear we operate two core businesses our marketleading global banking markets franchise and our growing asset wealth management platform both of which are being positioned to deliver midteen returns through the cycle as i reflect on the past five years much of what has always made goldman sachs extraordinary remains the same long track record of being a trusted advisor for the worlds leading businesses institutions and individuals a global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products geographies and solutions an aspirational brand exceptional people and a culture of collaboration and excellence additionally over this time we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a one goldman sachs operating ethos this approach coupled with our bestinclass talent advice and execution capabilities has strengthened and solidified our leadership position across our businesses as we sit here today our client franchise is as strong as ever enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions for our clients for example the ipo market has started to reopen since labor day there have been four marquee ipos priced in the united states arm holdings instacart klaviyo and birkenstock goldman sachs was lead left on three of those four and the joint lead book runner on the fourth no other bank can make that claim being entrusted to help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market requires longstanding client relationships deep market expertise and experience given the execution of these transactions im encouraged by the prospect of a wider reopening of capital markets if conditions remain conducive i expect a continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 activity as a leader in ma advisory and equity underwriting a resurgence in activity could be a tailwind for goldman sachs in asset wealth management our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes weve seen across our franchise while some active asset managers have faced quarterly outflows over the last few years we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of longterm feebased inflows we generated record management and other fees of billion and are well on our way of achieving our billion annual target for we are also ahead of pace on our billion target for alternative management fees while our marketleading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength we know we still have work ahead of us earlier this year at investor day we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus and we have made significant progress on these priorities most recently we announced the sale of greensky we also announced the sale of personal financial management this summer sold substantially all of our marcus loans portfolio weve reduced our historical principal investments by billion this year we are confident that the work were doing now provides us a stronger platform for and beyond as i assess the operating backdrop the us economy has proven to be more resilient than expected those are reasons to remain vigilant treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10year yields up basis points in the third quarter on top of that recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates driving market expectations of higherforlonger interest rates and there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates especially in light of the further tightening of financial conditions weve seen over the last quarter at the same time there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe indiscernible war in ukraine ongoing tensions with china and now the conflict in the middle east overall levels of risk are more elevated than weve seen in quite some time while we dont know where this will all lead it could impact economic growth and stability in the us and around the world and we remain cautiously positioned before i turn it over to denis id like to spend a moment on basel iii endgame proposal and reiterate my views on it we of course support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound financial system there are some who have recently said we need to address the lessons from the financial crisis which is driving the need for much higher regulations but frankly speaking the rules as proposed go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of doddfrank and other reforms not only have banks doubled capital outlays over the last years have improved the quality of capital increased liquidity simplified businesses and have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests requiring too much capital will have negative consequences i believe if these rules are implemented three things will happen first the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all size from large corporations to small businesses second more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector policies that incentivize the transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could in fact increase systemic risk and third us competitiveness will go down our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world theyre the engine of our economy has access to capital allows for innovation and growth across the country our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal the net result of these proposed rules will be slower economic growth in the us ph material improvement and the soundness of the banking system we alongside clients and others in the industry have been the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders and given this engagement we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately changes to the proposed rules though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risk remain top of mind i feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the longterm opportunities for goldman sachs we are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading global banking markets franchise and grow our asset wealth management business i feel good about the relative performance in our core business and we remain firmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders i will now turn it over to denis to cover financial results for the quarter denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the third quarter we generated net revenues of billion net earnings of billion resulting in ph eps of and a return on equity of as david highlighted earlier this year we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus and we made strong progress across a number of activities we provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table in aggregate these items reduced net earnings by million eps by and our roe by percentage points these items include results related to our historical principal investments within asset wealth management including the net impact of marks sell downs and cie impairments as well as results relating to greensky which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results additionally we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the pfm business turning to performance by segment starting on page global banking markets produced revenues of billion in the third quarter advisory revenues of million were down versus a strong prioryear period amid lower completions equity underwriting revenues rose yearoveryear to million though industry volumes remained well below medium and longerterm averages debt underwriting revenues of million also rose versus the third quarter of for the yeartodate we ranked number in the league tables across announced and completed ma as well as equity underwriting and ranked number in highyield debt our backlog fell quarteronquarter as we successfully brought transactions to market though market conditions are dynamic client engagement continues to be elevated and our bestinclass franchise remains wellpositioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter down from a strong performance last year particularly in currencies and commodities and up relative to the second quarter we produced record ficc financing revenues of million which rose sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products additionally we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of signature banks capital call facilities holding just over billion in commitments that were held for auction by the fdic in september as we spoke about at our investor day alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us and the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base so we can serve even more holistically with our one goldman sachs approach these activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive riskadjusted returns the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 equities net revenues were billion in the quarter equities intermediation revenues of billion rose year overyear on better performance and derivatives while equities financing revenues of billion were lower versus a record ph second quarter ph overall financing revenues across ficc and equities were nearly ph billion for the yeartodate representing a record performance for these more durable activities our financing results combined with the substantial share gains weve made since our first investor day are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business we are raising the floor in global banking markets as reflected by our yeartodate roe of despite muted activity levels across investment banking now moving to asset wealth management on page revenues of billion were lower yearoveryear primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments management and other fees increased yearover year to a record billion largely driven by higher average assets under supervision private banking and lending revenues were million up slightly yearonyear as higher deposit balances and spreads were offset by our sale of substantially all the marcus loan portfolio we remain were very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending both of which generated record revenues for the yeartodate period equity investments generated net losses of million driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate in aggregate the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results from marcus loans negatively impacted our pretax margin for the segment by percentage points for the yeartodate now moving to page total assets under supervision ended the quarter at trillion we saw billion of liquidity inflows and billion of longterm net inflows representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of longterm fee based inflows turning to page on alternatives alternative aus totaled billion at the end of the third quarter driving million of management and other fees for the quarter gross thirdparty ph alternatives fundraising was billion for the quarter and billion for the yeartodate we were pleased to announce the close of goldman sachs vintage fund ix sic vintage ix fund in the third quarter our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately billion total thirdparty fundraising since our investor day is now billion putting us well on pace to hit our billion target ahead of schedule onbalance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately billion of which roughly billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio in the third quarter we reduced this portfolio by over billion bringing yeartodate reductions to billion we are on track to achieve our yearend target of a historical principal investment portfolio below billion next platform solutions page revenues were million including a million revenue reduction related to the greensky loan book which was more than offset by million associated reserve release as we move the portfolio to heldforsale on page firmwide net interest income was billion in the third quarter down sequentially as increased funding costs supported training activities our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion flat with the prior quarter our provision for credit losses was million which reflected net chargeoffs in our credit card lending portfolio offset by the reserve release i mentioned related to greensky additionally within our wholesale the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 portfolio impairments were partially offset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter on page we provide additional detail on our cre exposure similar to last quarter cre loans continue to represent a relatively small percent of our overall lending book at cre investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than of the total onbalance sheet alternative investments across both equity investments and cies we have more marked or impaired office related exposures by approximately this year now turning to expenses on page total quarterly operating expenses were billion our yeartodate compensation ratio net of provisions is inclusive of approximately million of yeartodate severance costs at investor day in february we articulated a goal of million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be achieved in and and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal these efficiencies allow us to reinvest in our highest performing people particularly as the market for top talent remains fiercely competitive quarterly noncompensation expense ph was billion the yearoveryear increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the writedown of million in intangibles related to greensky as well as cie impairments of million while onetime expenses have been elevated for the yeartodate we continue to focus on bringing down noncomp expenses and are making progress on our million run rate efficiency goal our effective tax rate for the first nine months of was higher versus the first half due to the writeoff of deferred tax assets related to greensky and the geographic mix of our earnings for the full year we expect a tax rate of under now onto slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach basis points above our current capital requirement of in the quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchase of billion and common stock dividends of million given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter we remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield in conclusion our third quarter results reflect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities which will help drive our businesses to produce midteens returns through the cycle we are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for goldman sachs with that well now open up the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the qa roster operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks so much i guess just big picture if we add backlog significant items in the quarter were obviously still well short of the midteens target i know this is super slow times like decade lows in investment banking and youre in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of onbalance sheet stuff so i wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because in the back of our minds we also have the potentially up to increase in the denominator so i wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much comes do you think from improvement in capital markets activity how much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator i know its tough but i wanted to say high level indiscernible thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure glenn and appreciate the question and so well keep it high level and lets separate into what we got and then we can have a separate discussion about basel iii but first we are simplifying the firm and kind of managing the firm to drive us toward the overall majority of the firm to be in two core businesses our global banking markets franchise which is performing very well in an environment thats not a great environment for that business investment banking activities are well below 10year norms i dont think that will stay that way but if you look at the performance of the business through nine months that business which is kind of of the firm twothirds to of the firm that business is operating with a roe in an environment thats not the best environment for that overall business i cant tell you when the environment will get better but i do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years history tells us that it doesnt stay short it doesnt stay closed for multiple years at a time there is an adjustment were making the adjustment yes the worlds uncertain as we mentioned that could be a headwind but i do think it will improve and that business performs well and we firmly believe that that business is a midteens throughthecycle business the way weve materially grown our wallet shares the way weve grown our financing footprint which adds more balance to the business and with our marketleading franchises across that business second we have the asset wealth management business which we believe is midteens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal investments and make it a lower capital audio gap business were on that journey i think you see us making progress weve talked about how we reduced the historical principal investments by billion this year we set a target for billion by next year which well meet and then close to zero two years later and so that business we have a high degree of confidence will operate at mid teens or higher as we reposition it the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 as weve also stated were reducing the drag in our platforms were narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag and were relatively confident that over the next to months well make materially more progress in that so you add that up with what we have and i think you can get very comfortable with the midteens target now the basel rules the basel rules if they were implemented as their positioned now would be a headwind to that but also that doesnt account for how we optimize and how we passthrough pricing indiscernible im not saying it wont be a headwind but i dont want to speculate on what it would do to our target until we actually understand how its coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it so we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders and when theres more clarity on basel were committed to giving you clear picture of that view but i wouldnt jump to a conclusion on it at this point im not saying you are i wouldnt jump to a conclusion on it at this point glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that one quickie followup on your prepared remarks you mentioned a number of sectors that have yet to absorb the higher rates im curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how meaningful that is im thinking from more of a big picture economy standpoint but that caught my ear thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah glenn as i listen to you play it back what id say us economy has been more resilient the fiscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions thats occurred im still of the belief that theres been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy we will see more sluggishness now that doesnt necessarily mean it has to be a recession and certainly there is a good debate on where this all lands but we again in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions and i just think theres a lag in most sectors of the economy not all but most sectors of the economy and i do think over the next two to four quarters the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas i am hearing as i interact with ceos particularly around consumer businesses some softness particularly in the last eight weeks in consumer behaviors i dont want to overamplify that because i think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient but i think that indiscernible watching closely glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks so much operator well move to our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i guess maybe just one first follow up denis i just want to make sure i heard you correct did you say you marked your cre exposure by in cre office the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 and on that just give us a sense of visibility even beyond office cre clearly its a very manageable issue for you but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise how much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so yes to clarify for our ph cre and cie exposure in the office space weve either marked or impaired that down by about approximately this year so i think thats quite significant we started the year with about billion of cre alternative investments thats been reduced now by about billion three quarters of that was either through paydowns or dispositions the balance through marks and impairments so were making very very significant progress against those exposures if you were to look at the same set of exposures in ph nonoffice the adjustment there through marks or impairment is about yeartodate so we feel we reduced a lot of notional we appropriately reflected the valuations in those positions but as indicated by our target we intend to continue to move down those exposures ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just a separate question i think the capital markets environment it is what it is when you look at the firm over the next year or two if maybe david where do you see the best growth opportunities one maybe talk about the client franchise in capital markets financing is that getting better or worse and then theres a lot of talk about private credit direct lending youve talked about credit being an opportunity just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or two david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so on our global banking markets franchise we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on execution to continue to grow our wallet share we expanded our focus from the top accounts to the top accounts and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one two or three as opposed to just top three and so we still do see some wallet share opportunities but we obviously have very strong wallet share so thats not most significant we are growing our financing audio gap for our global banking markets franchise and we expect to continue to grow that financing footprint and we have a plan to continue to put more financial resources toward growing that financing footprint and we do think that it has reasonable returns and it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because were a significant financer ph with them when you turn to asset wealth management i think weve been very clear at our investor day and marc stated this we think we can grow the revenues in that business by highsingle digits that is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and a continued growth in the wealth management sector where we are experiencing good growth and we still see good opportunities in wealth management to grow the franchise all over the world and weve made continued good progress on that journey the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 when you talk about private credit we have as you know over billion of private credit weve launched private credit ph vehicles we obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at global banking markets and what we do with financing which we think can also be an asset wealth management opportunity for growth in private credit but we would expect significant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our asset wealth management franchise those are a handful of things id highlight at this point ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful thank you operator well move to our next question from christian bolu with autonomous research please go ahead christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning just another one on basel iii endgame appreciate that you think its going to change and all that but now that you had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is any more color on how you think it affects the competitiveness of the markets businesses are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted and then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure christian i appreciate it im going to talk very high level because again this is all fluid but obviously if these rules went in place the way theyre proposed they would have an effect on the businesses but its different from business to business there are certain activities that would meaningfully impact endusers whether theyre corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you pass on cost a corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative i cant imagine that their desire to hedge wont still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher obviously ph with some balance they would think about that differently there are certain businesses that we might reduce our activity level because with the new capital rules the returns dont look attractive but there are others and the one id point to thats most obvious which by the way a significant part of the impact to us would be is prime okay there arent a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business there are very few in europe a little bit and obviously the europeans if this was implemented this way would have an advantage but at the end of the day there are a handful of scaled players there are lots of scaled institutions that need that service our belief is wed be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way wed have to look at the final rules wed have to adjust so it will affect behavior it will affect pricing it will affect optimization but i know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer i think you need to see the rules and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality whatever it is and its not binary that it only affects us or others in the industry ph theres obviously the process of working through that as we have in the past christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you thats helpful maybe a question on the platform businesses here just have a twopart question i guess firstly can you just update us on how youre thinking about the partnership with apple can the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 economics work for goldman in the current state or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that partnership and then the second question is more on the credit quality in ph your senior credit cards kind of what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio how does it compare to your expectations and the broader sort of credit card industry david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc right ill start on the first part denis will make some comments on credit in the portfolio first i think you know we hired a gentleman named bill johnson whos got decades of experience to help us better run and better optimize the credit card portfolio the credit card partnerships as weve stated to you a number of times and ill repeat it here very clearly weve worked to narrow our focus youve seen us execute around marcus loans and greensky our partnerships with apple and gm are longterm contracts and we dont have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships so our focus at the moment is on managing them better getting rid of the drag and bringing them to profitability and were making progress both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them and bill johnson joining is helping with all that well continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine whats best in the long run for goldman sachs but our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next to months and ensuring we operate them better denis you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that were seeing denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure what id add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio a couple of things to bear in mind in consumer the net chargeoff ratio for the quarter was down from last quarter and the total dollar amount of chargeoffs down as well youll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at which we think is an appropriate level given our expectations for the portfolio that adjustment is basically a function of greensky being removed from that ratio and so now that applies to the cards portfolio but we feel good about where that stands right now on the overall performance of credit on the forward well continue to be focused we made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box and well continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment christian bolu a analyst autonomous research us lp great thank you operator well move to our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning david good morning denis so david you the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steve denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses was hoping you could just speak to the commitment to deliver on the efficiency goal maybe more specifically given changes in revenue mix some recently announced business exits and the heightening competition you cited how thats going to impact your ability to deliver on that if at all david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so we continue to be committed to the efficiency ratio but as you know were moving through were narrowing our focus were moving through some things that were trying to create more transparency on steve and highlight for you im going to turn to denis to make sure that we get the number right but ex those oneoff items the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc about ph david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc okay so putting in perspective because i think its important to highlight that we dont think the things that were highlighting continue in perpetuity were trying to narrow the focus and when we look at our global banking markets business and our asset wealth management platform we think we have the right target now back to your point steve about competition the competition for talent especially the best talent remains very very strong and so we think weve got a very very good talent ecosystem i feel good about the hiring were doing i just highlight that for our analyst ph jobs out of university we had applications for approximately jobs there were over million applications for employment at goldman sachs last year very very aspirational desirous place to work but the competition for talent remains high and so well strike the right balance in making an investment in our talent you heard denis ph talk about some of our efficiencies and the fact that the efficiencies allow us to make a reinvestment in ph some of the best talent we feel good about where we are but we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of global banking markets and asset wealth management that the efficiency ratio target that were highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color and just for my follow up a broader question on the sponsor outlook ph alt fundraising its continued at a healthy clip but pe is facing numerous headwinds whether its the lp denominator effect higher rates and just slower realization activity in general i was hoping you could speak to the broader outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor banking activity as well as the alternative asset management business david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so that broadly defines ph the sponsor community steven which really is the broad alternatives world private capital world the first thing id just say is we believe strongly that theres still a very very longterm secular growth trend that is intact and will continue i think theres some very very interest in macro dynamic i believe theres over trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations by the way charitable foundations who also invest so theres a very very strong dynamic of good flows and a shift especially given the size of the public markets into private asset classes and so we believe thats firmly intact theres no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than its been i would say it was extraordinarily robust in and and very very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodative but theres no question that all this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher the one thing i know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets and the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses and they also make money when they buy new assets they obviously have to buy new assets at different valuations with different financing costs now and what id say is for the last six quarters the last year and a half that community has been very quiet in our dialogue they are starting to see more interesting opportunities and i would expect in the next to months the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again both in terms of sales thats one of the reasons why im optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activity audio gap look forward over the course of the next four to eight quarters but also in terms of new purchases im not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in that would not be the normal but if you look at kind of 10year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity the sponsor activity would make up i would expect that youll see it go back to those averages and at the moment were well below those averages at the current point in time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful david thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 good morning david and denis thanks for taking my question id love to start on expenses and comp and david you just spoke a little to this when answering stevens question but the comp ratio we saw revenue growth broadly quarteroverquarter and yet the comp ratio ticked up which is rather unusual for goldman denis i know you layered in that there was nearly million of severance yeartodate was some of that in the third quarter was there unusual items impacting the comp ratio or was this mostly just because of the competition for talent thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so in terms of third quarter it was very very small we previously disclosed million of severance it was a small amount of severance in the quarter we just think its important to continue to call that out and highlight it so you can track that over the course of the year that obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of ph what were thinking for the full year and we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for yearend performance as well as what we expect to pay our people and were looking ph at the entire composition for this being mindful that we continue to pay for performance but also recognizing in particular across our core businesses we have leading market shares in global banking markets record yeartodate financing activity record management fees yeartodate record private banking and lending activities yeartodate and these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future and we think its important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our midteens returns in the future brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that denis and then when youre thinking about thanks for all the color on the cre and the exposures when youre thinking about these historical principal investments that you are intending to continue to sell by the end of next year what portion of those are cre or crerelated is it possible to give any color around the assets that youre going to sell and how exposed theyre to cre or other sectors denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so i made a comment earlier if you look at aggregate crerelated onbalance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans and debt securities equity securities and the remaining exposure of equity in our cie portfolio that in aggregate now stands at a little bit under billion billion and down already billion yeartodate there are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our firmwide activities our cra obligations and some coinvest exposures if you look at the in aggregate about of the cre onbalance sheet investments is ph hpi and thats what we are looking to sell down over time brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color operator well move to our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi the pivot is not new its been advertised i guess whats new is the actual losses so looking back who is accountable and who pays the price for the losses with greensky the marcus loans and the consumer expansion strategy that was wider than you wanted to be now and then looking ahead once you eliminate what you want to eliminate both on the consumer side and principal investments how much would that alone improve roe thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hi thanks mike appreciate the question the leadership of the firm which includes myself and the other senior leadership are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and for our people so obviously were responsible and accountable for any decision that we make ive said publicly before that im happy that we pivoted as you said the pivot is not new weve made the pivot we said we were going to do certain things with hindsight you will do certain things differently we obviously reflect we learn from the things that we do but i think its important for companies to try things for companies to learn and adapt when you make a decision that you thinks the wrong decision for shareholders and the firm you adjust accordingly so were doing that and were moving forward the second part of the question was mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc how much does roe improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining consumer businesses you want to get rid of david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think weve given you a bunch of transparency mike just by looking at this but if you look at what created a drag to roe this quarter of the drag to roe this quarter were the impairments and indiscernible historical principal investments and if you look over the last few quarters the most significant impact on roe performance has been the historical principal investments now also there were benefits in most historical principal investments historically but in this environment obviously you dont see that we think its a better business to release that capital and were on a fund business a lower capital fund business and so were driving that i think earlier in the call we talked about the throughthecycle performance of the banking markets business you can see the banking markets roe right now and also the forward roe of the asset wealth management business with less capital on it the drag from the platforms is getting smaller and over the next to months itll get smaller too hopefully eradicated and so that will give you a cleaner roe we continue to believe it can be midteens through the cycle mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 and then what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks in basel iii of course but to the extent that youre discarding off the principal investments that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i think denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks weve built a pretty big cushion and buffer given that we successfully reduced our scb based on actions were taking we think that under the stress test that we continue to reduce principal investments we will have more benefit to scb now obviously basel is out there and its uncertain so were at the moment operating a little bit more conservatively around that and weve highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity but we will continue to buy back stocks we will continue to pay our dividend and as we have clarity under this strategy there should be meaningfully more capital release which could ultimately benefit to further buyback but at the moment wed like were going to be a little bit more cautious ph and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we plow ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator well move to our next question from ryan kenny with morgan stanley the floor is yours ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question so wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets maybe asked another way so trading revenues are clearly extremely strong industry wallet in both fixed income and equity is tracking well above prepandemic levels and youve been taking share but looking forward is there any scenario related to basel endgame where we see industry wallet size shrink and as you think about higher forlonger rates how do you expect that that impacts the various trading businesses david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc look i think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world continues the growth in the government indiscernible continues the market capital world continues to grow and expand i cant and i wont speculate on exactly where the final basel rules windup and how everyone optimizes through all that but i dont think anything is changing in intermediation and the need to finance the positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing and so i continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprints ph and are in a leading position in these markets businesses i think theyre very well positioned in these market businesses of course there will be ups and downs in those businesses but i think the businesses will continue to perform very very well ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 operator our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thank you good morning david and denis want to come back to wealth management i know that the sale of personal financial management is a small business but just if you can remind us how and where you want to compete in wealth management moving forward and david maybe give a little more color on some of those growth opportunities you alluded to that youre seeing there across the globe thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i appreciate that question devin our focus is on ultrahigh net worth management where we have a leading franchise i just highlight that ultrahigh net worth management high net worth wealth management is still a very fragmented business and while we have a leading franchise leading franchise is kind of midsingle digit share and we have less share than that in places like europe and around the world weve seen really good growth in europe we see continued growth in the us we have an ability as we put more resources on the ground and invest in more resources to cover clients to continue to grow that business weve seen very good growth over the last five years we think we have meaningful run rate room to do that one of the decisions we made and again this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned is by selling united capital and selling pfm which was a small business as you highlight it allows us to take the resources and the investment we might have geared toward growing that and add it to our investment in ultrahigh net worth growth and we think thats a better returning business and something were very confident that we can continue to execute on devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific and then just quick followup so the billion capital call facilities with signature bank it sounds like you think that could help gain share with alternative asset managers and you framed out obviously why such an important customer base for goldman sachs so if you can maybe just give a little flavor for how thats going to help drive market share and how you think about where you sit with sponsors just given how important they are as a customer for wall street whether you have any sense of like where you are in the top three or where you can go from three to number one or just any flavor for where your market share opportunities exist there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure we have in traditional investment banking services we have leading share with sponsors across ma and leverage finance these capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business and while weve been in the business of capital facilities it is an area of growth for us an area of lending growth for us one of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us where we havent been a lender and we havent been engaged in this activity and it gives us an attachment to them so this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we were in meaningfully again and i made this comment when we were talking about the global banking markets business financing your clients strengthens your overall position with them because the financing is important to them and so as we continue to finance sponsors i think it strengthens an already very strong position with the sponsor community the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc understood thank you operator well move to our next question from dan fannon with jefferies please go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i had a question on platform solutions so for the quarter if we exclude the writedown is this a reasonable run rate for expenses and as you think about achieving your target of profitability in this business is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth and then if you could also just give an outlook for transaction banking just given revenues are down both sequentially and yearoveryear denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you for the question i dont think its the right run rate i think theres a combination of things that we expect over the next months in terms of growth in revenue composition of the clients as well as ongoing efficiency with respect to expenses so i think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis i think on transaction banking weve tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business which is to grow a higher quality client business over the longterm we had grown quickly we are now focused on growing with high quality clients high quality deposits as you know the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially i think reasonably in line with the industry given some migration to other higheryielding opportunity sets but we did grow our client count we remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall investment banking franchise and footprint and we think it could be a good valueunlock over the longerterm for goldman sachs daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks and as a followup you mentioned in terms of alternatives in the fundraising that the private equity challenges but maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that youre in the market with today and then also as you think of the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward and when should we start to see those become a material component of the overall revenue profile denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so on the alternative space our fundraising activity billion in the quarter billion yeartodate has been broadbased we have a broadbased platform we have mentioned the secondaries fund david covered some of the private credit spaces these are big areas of interest for our clients around the world theyre particularly relevant we expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds were in a position to start ph distributing carry so incentive fees will be lumpy they will depend on the performance of different funds but we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond when we laid out at investor day the building blocks for our the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 performance in the segment we put on the page not only the top line target information that david covered earlier but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis so i think thats a source of upside for us operator well move to our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david good morning denis david in the past you and you talked about the ipos the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter but in the past you talked about green shoots and part of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they wanted to go public theyre going to have to recognize that the valuations they are far below where they were in at the peak of the cycle are you finding those conversations easier today or are you finding more people are recognizing thats correct and if they want to go public they just have to accept it david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i mean i appreciate the question gerard i think absolutely theyre easier and if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the valuation now but i dont think those discussions are difficult i think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them and i think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to advance themselves strategically denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc and gerard id just add its actually especially helpful to have ph numerous real data points ph in market both ph those space for equities and across the leveraged finance space so the conversations that were having with our clients now who are looking to access the markets theyre informed by our leading role and insights into most of the activity thats been accomplished in the last several weeks and so i think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market what types of terms and pricing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very helpful and then as a followup its not a big line item obviously for you folks but can you share with us some of the color in the transaction banking area that was obviously a new business line that you guys created just how is it going i saw the revenues were down slightly i think sequentially but whats going on in that line of business and again i get it its not a major line of business for you folks at this time denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure no thanks gerard our transaction banking activity remains a strategic focus the revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarteroverquarter basis those things are linked we have grown our client count and we remain committed to making the investments to grow highquality balances and clients in that business over the medium to longterm no change in strategy the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator our next question comes from saul martinez with hsbc the floor is yours saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi thanks for taking my question i wanted to drill down a little bit more on platform solutions i think denis you mentioned that this quarter isnt necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues but even this quarter if i adjust for the loan markdown and the impairments it seems like you are if my math is correct you are ppnr positive obviously credit costs are high as the credit card book is seasoning and you are still growing that portfolio but if you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting back to or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next say months denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks saul so just a couple things on glide path to help with the question and the context so rate of growth is important in a business like this thats been growing very very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with cecl we expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further and that has some positive impacts and then as david mentioned we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional and were working very very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform we remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efficiency for the platforms for our clients and for goldman sachs i think its a combination of the way were going to grow on the forward combined with how we manage the expense and the operating efficiency saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thats helpful and just maybe a quick followup there i think you mentioned that ncos net chargeoffs are down this quarter is that and you do have a reserve coverage it does seem like youre maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning could come down quite a bit especially under cecl so maybe just give us a sense of how youre feeling about the credit outlook and is my assessment right that your reserving could especially if you slow down it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so you have a couple of facts that are right we did have a chargeoff ratio that was down sequentially quarter overquarter from to and lower chargeoffs we are not necessarily predicting thats the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio its something were still mindful of given the environment given the vintages in which weve originated those exposures we do feel that the coverage ratio at is appropriate and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses so as we move forward our expectation is well continue to see elevated chargeoffs and as you look at our reporting on that with greensky pulled out of the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 consumer line youll have a more pure look at the cards platform and we do expect that will show elevated chargeoffs saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc great thank you operator for our next question well return to mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a clarification on my prior question so if i have this right you reduced your pe investments by billion quarteroverquarter and that allowed a billion reduction in capital allocated to the asset management wealth segment i mean is that completely correlated so if you get rid of the billion of remaining principal investments does that free up say billion is that ballpark right denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc no mike i think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time we gave a number of about billion of capital release for the entire portfolio so i dont think id be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers but i dont think we have billion incremental on the forward significantly less than that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so how much do you have left then once you describe the billion that remains how much capital should be freed up denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc i mean on a yeartodate basis based on the activity that weve undertaken thats a release of about billion to give you a sense so we probably have remaining midsingledigits mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and as far as the comp ratio should we consider these onetime charges as part of comp or would that be excluded when we think about our models denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual we do think of them as more one time in nature we as you know did a head count reduction earlier in this year thats not our current expectation to repeat that if anything we think that the work weve done to rightsize the firm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our head count on the forward so we dont expect that type of severance to repeat itself and we are taking into account as we said the compensation ratio that severance the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the firm indiscernible continue to drive the franchise operator at this time
