southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 john c corbett chief executive officer director southstate corp thank you will good morning everybody thanks for joining us for southstates third quarter results for the quarter we generated broadbased growth in loans deposits revenue and earnings per share asset quality metrics remain stable and expenses are in check and with the backdrop of an improving yield curve the setup is looking pretty good for weve got a positive gdp forecast and low unemployment so it feels like were transitioning to a period of expanding margins and accelerating growth two ingredients that are good for any business its also been a quarter that presented the challenge of the hurricane season our hearts go out to our teammates and clients that endured the worst of the storms for the most part the severe damage you see on the news is isolated to specific areas and not reflective of the broader geography however power outages cell phone disruption and gasoline shortages were widespread for a week or more our business continuity team kept the bank running without disruption so it really wasnt as much of an operational challenge since weve been through this before but it was a chance to pull together as a community bank and for neighbors to help neighbors and for our team members to help one another at southstate we have an employeefunded foundation called the sunshine fund and that foundation provided generators groceries and needed supplies to fellow employees that were impacted by the storm several of you reached out with notes of concern and we appreciate that we continue to be excited about our partnership with independent financial everything appears to be on track we received shareholder approval in august and things are progressing as planned with the regulatory approval process rather than waiting until closing both the independent and southstate teams are traveling together now throughout texas colorado and throughout the southeast were building new friendships long before we get to the closing and a conversion next summer all in all things are looking pretty good our strategy is to build our firm in the best markets with the best scale and the best business model and culture our colleagues from independent share that vision and together were working towards that goal which we believe will drive long term shareholder value will why dont you go ahead and walk us through the moving parts on the balance sheet and the income statement william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp thank you john high level the third quarter core profitability was consistent with the second quarter with total revenue up million and noninterest expenses up million for another quarter of ppnr of million net interest income was up million on an additional day count and noninterest income was flat our nim of was down basis points from q2 loan yields increased basis points or basis points excluding accretion with that difference due to the early payoff of an acquired loan with the premium loans grew to annualized in the quarter consistent with our midsingle digit expectation for the year with single family residential and ci loans experiencing the highest growth the single family growth was mostly a result of construction loans moving into the residential portfolio upon completion you may notice a sizable increase in our yield on loans held for sale that is due to our sba securitization business which obtained its southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 pooling license and is now up and running those loans are on our balance sheet while pools are being created and they carry higher yields than the single family residential loans that have historically made up that line item deposit costs increased basis points to total deposits grew during the quarter with customer deposits up million on an ending basis and up approximately million on average customer deposit growth was predominantly in money market accounts with ddas flat we also elected to issue some brokered cds to replace fhlb overnight advances both of these areas of deposit growth caused the overall cost of total deposits to increase a few basis points above our mid1 guidance ill note that we did lower our deposit costs effective october including on exception priced accounts in alignment with our previous execution plan steve will give some color on our future margin guidance in the qa noninterest income of million was slightly above expectations with correspondent up million or million excluding the expense on variation margin collateral this was offset by a million decline in mortgage and a million decline in other noninterest income nie excluding nonrecurring items of million was up million from q2 higher salary expense due to july merit increases was offset by lower incentives and commissions looking ahead to q4 we expect nie to fall in the million to million range depending upon some variable expense items one note ill make about nie with the upcoming merger with independent several positions that are open or that were budgeted to be filled this year are being held open with plans for independent team members to fill those roles as such were seeing some reduced nie this year while we wait to close the merger and welcome those independent employees to the team our provision for credit losses was million for funded loans offset by a release of million for unfunded commitments for a total release of million unfunded commitment level declines continued strong asset quality and economic data and forecasts drove this result net chargeoffs remained low at million or basis points annualized total reserve levels ended the quarter at down basis points from q2 npas declined million with substandard and special mention loans essentially flat past dues and payment performance continue to be strong and line of credit utilization rates continue to remain flat except for the funding of construction loans as projects move towards completion capital improved again with our tce ratio growing to our cet1 to and our tbv per share growing to end at operator well now take questions southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you we would begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of catherine mealor kbw catherine your line is now open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i thought we could just start on the margin steve if you could provide us with your updated outlook on how you see the margin moving towards the next quarter and then into next year just with the updated movein rates youve talked about how youre better positioned for rate cuts i think before youve said that every rate cuts about to basis points in nim improvement just curious if that still stands and how you think about the nim moving forwards thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yeah sure catherine and ill try to kind of right set the third quarter where we were and then kind of go from there on forward so if you look at page on the review of quarter three results total revenue was right in line with our guidance nim was down basis points this quarter from to but mainly that was due to the increase in deposit costs of about basis points and for nim we forecasted it to be flat in the last call and so and the deposit cost to be up to basis points but on the other side noninterest income we had forecasted noninterest income to average assets to be to and it ended up on the higher end at so a little low on nim and a little high on noninterest income so what happened from the june to september the 10year treasury fell about basis points which caused us to have less cash collateral from our counterparties and in order to compensate for this decrease in cash we raised more higher comp deposits and funds throughout the quarter the effects of this were it moved our noninterest income up million versus the second quarter through the interest on centrally cleared margin line on page it shows up as under the correspondent bank thats really an interest expense and moved our interest expense and deposits up by the same amount so in summary without that movement between the line items nim would have been which would have been flat cost of deposits would have been indiscernible and noninterest income to average assets would have been about indiscernible so total revenue didnt change but it was in two different buckets so i thought i would just kind of start out and kind of right set where we are because of the movement in the 10year southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 but to your question as we think about guidance for next year were really just reiterating what the last quarters guidance for every rate cut were looking to to basis points for each of rate cuts which is what weve said before and its consistent with our modeling the timing of such we think that you get to to basis points within the first three to six months roughly twothirds of that will be within the first quarter and then the rest of it will happen as you reprice the cd book but itll happen within a pretty short period of time but yeah the midquarter its probably not going to be much in that quarter but more in the next quarter but i think thats the normal lag one of the things that we missed on last call was to exit nim in the fourth quarter with first quarter of im sorry with ibtx and we continue to see that we also looking at our balance sheet the fourth quarter would be about roughly billion in loans billion in deposits this is the end of and then the other guidance that we give and maybe just a little bit of an update is preibtx for noninterest income we think will be around basis points little bit on the high end just because of the drop in rate postibtx last quarter we said noninterest income to average assets would be in the to basis points we think now thatll be on the high end of that range just because of that movement so anyway i guess the point of all thats just to reiterate is let me just kind of outline a couple factors that were thinking through as we model number one its theres really four of them one is the level of the 10year treasury so if for some reason the 10year treasury went lower than it would really have no effect on the revenue but it would have lower nim higher noninterest income so really thats not a real revenue item the second one is level the fiveyear treasury that affects our loan and securities repricing we have about between now this is just us on a standalone basis between now for the fourth quarter this year and all four quarters of next year we have about billion a quarter in loans so billion in total by the end of next year of loans and about billion in total securities maturing by the end of and at todays rates we pick up about basis points over what the coupon is today if the fiveyear treasury moves higher or lower it would move that spread there the third one is this fed rate cut last quarter we talked about six rate cuts was factored in end of now with like seven or eight the things that will affect would be floating rate loans and deposits but i kind of look at the level of those indiscernible probably offset each other a little bit the last one is just our ibtx day one mark so as we contemplate closing that in the first quarter when we announced the deal the fiveyear treasury was around today its about so basis points lower what that leads to is less day one dilution more capital and less eps accretion maybe nim however as we think about that extra capital the question for us going forward if we did close on today is do we take that excess capital and restructure our own bond book with that capital that we already have those are the things that were thinking about but the bottom line is theres some pluses and minuses on all of that but our guidance based on what we model is the same catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats really comprehensive and helpful and just looking at next quarter is do you believe that or can you talk a little about what youre seeing in deposit costs with the first basis points cut i mean i know deposit cost increased this quarter but if we look kind of towards the back part of the quarter are you seeing an inflection to where we could actually see deposit cost decline next quarter or do you still think were stable to up a little bit for a time period southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yeah no thats good question and yes just as will mentioned in the call i think they cut rates in the middle of september we did not cut our deposit rates until october but we did cut them and if you recall we have about billion of exception priced deposits and about billion of cds so as we thought about it were trying to get about of the rate cuts on the exception priced deposits and then of course about on the cds and of course the cds kind of roll out over the first six months so we did see that we did execute it so we would expect that that would happen in the fourth quarter we also expect that over time that well get a beta over time in deposits but we did execute october and we looked and have no issue with that catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great very helpful thank you stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp thank you catherine operator your next question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler stephen your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thanks you guys talked i think will you spoke briefly on growth in consumer resi and a lot of that being from construction migrating over to permanent but i think i heard you also say the yields were better than traditional resi can you give us a feel for that and kind of how you think about balance sheeting consumer resi at this point given the rate environment just kind of strategically there william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah what i was talking about stephen i think sorry for the lack of clarity and i apologize my voice im battling a cold but the also about the loans held for sale we announced earlier this year a team in houston that buys and pools sba loans and then sells them in securities and so the loans held for sale bucket in q3 included some sba loans and of course those loans are primeplus type and its all the guaranteed portion but thats a higher yield than what you see in the loans held for sale traditionally which is up made up of single family residential so that was that comment there really wasnt related to sort of the balance sheet portfolio of consumer real estate but the loans held for sale line item if you look at the yield table youll see that that yield went up pretty markedly from q2 to q3 in that item john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah and stephen id just said theres a little bit of noise in that line just because the average balances versus ending but the bottom line is theyre a little bit higher yielding loans that are floating and then eventually that team will turn them into securities and get fee income from them so thats a group that were really excited about and just started this quarter and doing the production southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it got it thanks for the clarification there sorry i misunderstood that and then just maybe to follow up on that i guess residential real estate the question there i mean would you as you see spreads on that portfolio do you want that percentage of loans to kind of remain in this or has that become a less viable or less beneficial component of the balance sheet in this rate environment just kind of how do you think about that percentage of loans and growing or shrinking it stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure stephen this is steve what will naturally happen when we merge with independent that percentage of loans will decrease i cant remember exactly how far but i want to say its or and then i would think that we would kind of hold it pretty constant from there might grow or but i would expect that as we continue to grow and grow our ci and other businesses that the balance sheet will probably particularly be used there and then fee income will be more on the residential side i think this quarter our residential production was about secondary portfolio our goal would be over time to get that closer to and to use the balance sheet for both our private banking clients as well as some of our low to mod portfolio products stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay helpful and then just last one for me i know john you kind of talked about the overall strategy of building the best team in the best markets and obviously great trajectory there with the ibtx deal pending do you guys think about slow down potential hiring in your existing markets do you kind of hold back capital and resources to think more about new hires in those new markets in or kind of how do you think about that build out moving forward and where you want to allocate resources to talent john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah stephen as we join with independent one of the things the team out there is excited about is the treasury management platform that were going to bring to bear for them that weve worked on for a number of years here at southstate if you think about ci and middle market banking having that sophisticated treasury management tool really is the foundation of that so once we get that in place we envision having our texas team colorado team continue to recruit but maybe a little bit more in the ci area and layer that on top of the great cre work that they do and were just going to continue to be opportunistic just like we always are in our existing markets to hire great teams and not feel constrained on the budget from that standpoint were going to remain opportunistic stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect very helpful guys thanks so much for the time operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james michael your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions just wanted to touch on the reserve release this quarter you guys have been understandably cautious and have built the reserve pretty meaningfully over the past couple years and it seems like the environment is now improving obviously therell be some accounting gymnastics with the acquisition but could we expect to see either further releases as rates come down or just very low levels of provisioning as we move forward just hopefully the environment remains steady to improved thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah michael its will and obviously thats a difficult question as weve talked about before but i think what id say is that the loss drivers the economic forecasts are correlated with losses historically in the various portfolios what they projected at the end of the third quarter running the model generated the result that we had which was that the reserve level needed to come down a little bit as it did and as we talk about cecl of course it is a forwardlooking model so in theory and in practice i guess you should see reserve build well in advance of chargeoffs and you could see reserve releases even if the bank were to see some chargeoffs pick up but i think to answer your question one word answer would be yes i think you could see reserve releases from here from us and others you could see reserve levels come down but it all will be driven by number one the economics the loss drivers and b the or number two the characteristics of the portfolio how its performing what banks are seeing in their own portfolio so its hard to predict anything looking forward but its not unlikely that you could see that going forward i wouldnt necessarily build that in your model but it well could come at that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah totally understand just wanted to understand conceptually just because all the forwardlooking indicators criticized classified being kind of flat qonq and again rates coming down just separately just wanted to touch on kind of the growth outlook i think what weve heard from a lot of banks this quarter is some near term trepidation but pipelines still remain strong and i think people are optimistic once we get through the election and kind of figure out what the rules of the game are you could potentially see some acceleration next year so just wanted to get a sense from you guys what youre seeing in your markets which are obviously very strong and then just follow on that i saw that ibtx is exiting the warehouse business so thats one vertical that youre not going to have on a pro forma basis is there anything else that youre either looking to bolster or maybe not shutter but just reduce in terms of a focus thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah michael its john in our markets the pipelines are steady dipped in after silicon valley picked up in the fall of last year and theyve really been steady at about billion for the last three or four quarters and we guided late last year that we thought this year would be kind of a midsingle digit growth year and the primary factor driving and controlling that is the shape of the yield curve its just not as attractive to step on the gas right now in an inverted yield curve and it looks like that inversion lasts if you believe the forecast probably through midnext year but as the yield curve shape begins to normalize and begins to steepen we think there will be an acceleration in growth the components of growth michael if you look at this year have been more ci oriented weve done about ci growth yeartodate a this past quarter but cre activity has slowed down largely because we believe the funding of construction loans largely multifamily is beginning to wane and just less appetite for cre with the shape of the yield curve so anyway i think going into our guidance probably southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 remains in that midsingle digit range and when that yield curve starts to take a more normal shape it probably picks up from there given the strength of our markets stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yeah and ill just followup michael on your mortgage warehouse question from independent and you know in our merger model the way we contemplated that originally is that that would those balances would not be there and that they would be in the cash balances and thats part of our billion at the end of next year guide at so that was always contemplated because of our conversations with independent and their thought of exiting that business so there is nothing new we just didnt werent able to publicly say that at that time michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right great color thank you for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of dave bishop with hovde group dave your line is now open q good morning this is ph justin on for dave i had a question on credit quality in the multifamily and office portfolios curious if you have any line of sight into potential upgrades there and given the recent increases in criticized assets is there is that any in any way related to rent abatements or leaseup issues thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah were ph justin were pretty pleased with the asset quality trends this quarter past dues are still low about basis points only basis points of chargeoffs independent actually had zero chargeoffs during the quarter and npas trended down so specifically as it relates to office and to multifamily what were hearing from our credit team and office is they feel like from the properties that were invested in that the work from home trend has bottomed youre seeing amazon and other companies require employees back to the office now will there continue to be some issues over the next couple of years sure but i think as we show in our deck were concentrated in more small offices under square feet not the over square feet where the kansas city fed thinks therell be most of the issues on multifamily as we look at that portfolio the substandard increase that weve seen is really more about rising interest rates on floating rate loans we continue to see absorption in those properties its happening a little bit slower i think when we went back and analyzed on the construction loans multifamily weve got of them are performing exactly as we planned as it relates to rental rates and vacancy the other ones that are behind theyre not behind by much the rental rates are off by maybe about i feel pretty good that with the inmigration and the lack of housing supply that those properties are going to fill up theyll just take about a year longer than maybe we plan on that portion so hopefully that gives you some color on what were seeing in those properties but right now in theory theyre performing great i mean our past due ratio of cre is only basis points william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 yeah and ill just add ph justin from the standpoint of timing of downgrades upgrades we our general posture is to be quick to downgrade and slower to upgrade so if rates stay lower or move lower it doesnt mean that the next quarter were going to start upgrading things right away we generally like to see some trending and some sustained improvement so we think thats a good conservative philosophy to have q great thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with citi ben your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc so i know you talked through the rate movement in and 10year kind of impacting the nii and cash balances i mean if were kind of marktomarket here would it kind of reverse 10year up as much as it is this quarter or is there a lag effect indiscernible whole conversation might be futile if the 10year goes back down but im just kind of curious on how fast that changes everything stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure its ben this is steve really probably the best way to think about it is based on the average yield of the 10year in any particular period of time thats probably what drives it but i think in the second quarter the average yield of the senior treasury i think was around or and the average of the third quarter was about so id kind of use kind of i think it was maybe so i would kind of use the average 10year treasury in a quarter as sort of a benchmark and then because i think the 10year actually even went down to maybe or so i mean its been kind of wild ride to in a quarter i look at the average and assuming that most forecasts have the 10year treasury somewhere in the range give or take i would use our run rate in the third excuse me in the third quarter as kind of that interest on variation margin sort of use that same number as expense there benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 got you okay thats helpful and then i know you gave some updated thoughts on margin especially next year i mean was high level obviously but is that marking to market both sides of the transaction or is that just yours stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp youre speaking to the independent transaction as well is that what youre speaking to benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc indiscernible stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp it did yes it did include ibtx im sorry so the fourth quarter exit rate would include first quarter closing plus our to basis points for each cut plus ibtx all of that included billion in loans billion in deposits fourth quarter exit rate in that to range yeah benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you all right and then just kind of higher level here when you think about you talked to deposit pricing you trimmed it on the 1st of october here can you kind of give us sense of the response have people looked to shop for higher rates potentially i know you have a really welldiversified deposit cost and flow which i think is great but the problem with being kind of the lowest deposit franchise is youre kind of more at risk when things are still stay elevated just kind of curious on any kind of anecdotal response you might be seeing from clients stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure yeah so far were three weeks into it and really nothing notable i will say that if you kind of think about we have indiscernible in deposits what i would describe to you was about billion of it is exception priced so its a really maybe not a quarter maybe its or so thats really the sensitive interest rate piece of it so the other indiscernible is not all that sensitive billion is not all that sensitive because they werent sensitive to begin with because theyre checking account relationship account so its really the billion youre talking about and in those cases we exception price those closer to market and so when the fed moves it would make sense that those rates would come down so it doesnt surprise me on that billion we havent had a ton of pushback well continue to monitor of course but thats where the sensitivity is not on the other piece of the business and thats why the our checking account franchise is so valuable with the granular retail small business and commercial account william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah and then with the billion cd book the our cd rates are never top of the market so someone is shopping to get the best cd and the markets not going to come into southstate because of those rates and then the brokered cd book of course is at the marginal market cost benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 got you okay thats helpful appreciate thanks guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp thanks ben operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson gary your line is now open gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning everybody john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp morning gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co wanted to ask more nim question if you assume that 10year and that the income statement geography of the variation margin piece does not change this quarter does the basis point cut in the september as opposed to kind of push out the ability to show nim expansion all else equal stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp no no i would expect all of that sort of was third quarter event as i was talking about kind of the third quarter 10year treasury so assuming fourth quarter 10year treasury is roughly the same our cost of deposits have now been fully baked in the third quarter we did on october cut deposit rate so i would expect youd have nim expansion basis points something like that in the fourth quarter because its all sort of right set at a and then you move up from there gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate that and i know you gave kind of the outlook loaded for ibtx on fees to average assets just kind of thinking through the year on the expense side when the dust settles towards the end of do you have a kind of a bogey for expense to average assets kind of exiting into stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp gary dont have that i dont have it in that terms i guess looking at the various components were still of course doing our final planning for indiscernible like everybody else not ready to give real precise guidance on but in general since our own legacy southstate expense base you should see sort of inflationary type lets call it to type nie on our book and then we got the ibtx merger occurring and with their nie base we are still confident that we will achieve the cost saves we announced on that merger and so if you take those components thats kind of where how we see nie shaping up for next year there obviously would be a lot of noise in quarterly close and then the quarter of the conversion which is scheduled for the memorial day southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 weekend so in the second quarter and then after that the third quarter should be a pretty clean nie quarter and certainly the fourth quarter even more so for next year william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah and i would just add i think as you think about the fourth quarter most of those costs will probably be out of the cost saves and if you kind of take our run rate their run rate add it together make the changes for the cdi and get the cost saves i think the its roughly around of assets kind of a billion run rate give or take on a annualized run rate so i think thats about where we think thatll be but could be in that general range of the assets probably a good way to think about it gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co got it thank you operator there is no further question at this time i will now turn the conference back over to john corbett for closing remarks john john c corbett chief executive officer director southstate corp
