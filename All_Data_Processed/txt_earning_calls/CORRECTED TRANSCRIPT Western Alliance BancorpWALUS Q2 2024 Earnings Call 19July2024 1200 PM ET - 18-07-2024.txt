you miles good morning everyone ill make some brief comments about our second quarter earnings before turning the call over to dale who will review our financial results in more detail after i discuss our updated outlook tim bruckner is back by popular demand our chief credit banking officer regional banking will join us for qa western alliance earned per share in the second quarter and demonstrated the bank building momentum as our repositioning strategy has transitioned into earnings growth strategy growth will be accompanied by an elevated risk management architecture as well as enhanced liquidity profile and capital base thoughtful balance sheet growth in q2 drove an upward inflection in net interest income from increased liquidity deployment into higher yielding earning assets we generated outsized core deposit growth of billion and hfi loan growth of billion or on an annualized basis from q1 which we expect will exceed our peers cet1 capital remained at deposit growth in excess of guidance lowered our hfi loantodeposit ratio by points to our liquidity profile was also bolstered by a billion increase in securities and cash from quarter end which allowed us to pay down borrowings by million and growth of deposits by million our differentiated national commercial banking franchise uniquely positioned us to generate sustained deposit growth from various business lines and deploy this liquidity into attractive no to low loss ci commercial loans where we have deep segment and product expertise asset quality overall is normalizing which we expect total classified assets declined million in the quarter to basis points net chargeoffs were basis points of average loans the majority of which relates to the downtown san diego office property we identified on this call a year ago when it migrated to substandard western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 i think its also important to note the renewed earnings power of our franchise strengthens our ability to consistently compound capital and generate risk adjusted earnings growth to support the q3 and q4 earnings ramp we have previously communicated for the quarter net interest income grew annualized driven by higher average earning assets and an expanding nim annualized deposits and hfi loan growth of and respectively pushed net interest income higher higher ending balances compared to average balances establishes a higher jumping off point to increase net interest income going forward in total preprovision net revenue adjusted for the fdic special assessment in q4 and the rebate in q1 is annualized and is poised to continue its upward trajectory at this point ill turn the call over to dale for a review of our financial results dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken during the second quarter western alliance generated preprovision net revenue of million net income of million and eps of net interest income increased million from q1 to million due to higher average earning asset balances and yields noninterest income of million decreased million quarteroverquarter primarily from lower income from equity investments as well as softer mortgage revenue mortgage loan production rose and interest rate lock commitment volume increased while the gain on sale margin compressed by basis points noninterest expense was million deposit costs of million drove the quarteroverquarter increase to find attractive loan growth amidst an elevated rate environment net interest income growth exceeded the increase in deposit cost by million this quarter as mortgage warehouse deposit growth continues to benefit from market share gains amidst industry obstruction in the first quarter we believe western alliances warehouse lending group has become the premier bank in this space considering our enhanced liquidity profile we are wellpositioned to proactively lower the ecr cost of these deposits as the first rate cut approaches provision expense of million resulted from loan growth above industry trends as well as million of net chargeoffs securities and cash increased billion quarteroverquarter and allowed for a further million reduction in period end borrowing loans held for investment billion to billion while deposits increased billion to billion at quarter end finally tangible book value per share continued its expansion rising or to march 31st to loan growth is primarily driven in ci categories of billion which offset continued purposeful reductions in residential and consumer loans of million and construction and land of million mortgage warehouse tech innovation and fund banking loan growth drove loan mix diversification while we reduced our cre concentration on a yearoveryear basis ci loans have grown billion deposit growth of billion was led by mortgage warehouse and followed by growth in juris banking and our digital consumer channel nonecr noninterest bearing deposits have posted three consecutive quarters of growth and we are encouraged by the traction our diversified deposit channels are gaining which should continue to drive growth in deposits that carry no direct or imputed interest costs turning now to our net interest drivers the yield on home securities increased basis points to recapturing twothirds of the prior quarters decline from the hqla build conducted in the first quarter completing our accelerated liquidity build related to larger balance sheet repositioning efforts allowed us to add more higher western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 yielding securities our liquidity position remains solid as unencumbered high quality liquid assets were of securities in cash compared to last quarter securities and cash in total held steady at of assets hfi loan yields increased basis points due to asset repricing benefits from the ongoing higher rate environment backweighted loan growth momentum led to period end loan balances exceeding average balances by billion the cost of interest bearing deposits were basis points higher from the first quarter while the total cost of funds declined basis points to due to a deposit mix shift toward noninterest bearing and a pay down of shortterm borrowings in aggregate net interest income increased million from higher average earning asset balances which includes a full quarters impact of the deployment of liquidity into securities towards the end of q1 as well as a basis point decline in the cost of liability funding net interest margin expanded basis points from the first quarter to from the billion increase in average earning assets as the growth was funded more from non interest bearing liabilities this quarter our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was net interest income growth was the primary contributor to this improvement deposit cost increased million from higher average ecrrelated deposit balances as noted earlier these higher balances funded commercial loan growth and purchased floating rate securities that propelled strong net interest income growth other operating expenses were essentially flat quarteroverquarter as ken mentioned earlier asset quality continues to normalize total classified assets declined million in the quarter to basis points of total assets nonperforming assets were essentially flat from last quarter just under twothirds of npls are paying as agreed when excluding the san diego property that ken cited earlier which we expect to move into other real estate turning to slide quarterly net loan chargeoffs of million or basis points of average loans most of the chargeoffs this quarter were attributed to the san diego office property provision expense of million cover net chargeoffs and added reserves in concert with loan growth our allowance for funded loans increased million from the prior quarter to million total loan acl to funded loans ratio of basis points was unchanged and covers of nonperforming loans our focus on growing loans in inherently low loss categories has resulted in a reserve level lower than some peers slide shows our acl lift from basis points to when incorporating the effect of creditlinked notes which insulate us from the first loss on covered credit as well as loans to loan notolowloss categories like equity fund resources our low ltv residential portfolio and mortgage warehouse loans more specifically for the creditlined notes we have in our possession million from insurers that we can deduct first losses on an billion mortgage portfolio leaving us with zero loss risk for our residential loans not covered by insurance these mortgages have an ltv at only at origination which is likely lower now to borrowers and fico scores of and debttoincome ratios at and have incurred no losses for efr capital call loans and mortgage warehouse credit not only have we never had a loss but other banks have had pristine credit experience as well we include this in a lockup for the acl because we have a large proportion in our book in these very low risk categories and other institutions our reserve level is supported by our low realized losses weve consistently discussed our proactive mitigation strategy along with our low advanced lending discipline is important ultimately indiscernible credit exposure western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 on slide we present a historical look back on migration performance which shows over the last three years wal ranks fourth or approximately onethird of the peer median on net chargeoffs to average nonperforming loans over the past decade we ranked number one at only the table on the right shows our allowance covers over times the last months net chargeoffs inclusive of the second quarter and places us in the top third among peers our acl also covers our last four years of net chargeoff which is the duration of our loan book by times which is the second best in the peer group during this timeframe our cet1 ratio remained our tangible common equity ratio to total assets moved down approximately basis points from q1 to as asset growth and low risk categories exceeded organic capital accretion from higher earnings i think its helpful to consider other sources of lossabsorbing capital when evaluating our balance sheet viewing our cet1 capital ratio with aoci marks and loss reserve as a percentage of riskweighted assets we ranked in the top third of our peer group notably among the six peers on slide with higher acl to net chargeoff ratios over the last months only two have higher adjusted capital ratios than wal finally tangible book value per share increased from the end of q1 to from retained earnings growth which equates to the annualized growth rate of approximately our consistent upward trajectory and tangible book value per share has outpaced peers by times since the end of ill now hand the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thanks dale following our q2 results i would like to update the banks guidance as follows a building pipeline provides clarity to continue loan growth at billion per quarter in a safe sound and thoughtful manner our current loantodeposit ratio provides flexibility to selectively make more loans as opportunities arise for the full year loans are expected to grow billion compared to the billion previously and deposits are expected to grow billion which is billion above our previous forecast deposit growth in q3 is expected to be billion turning to capital we expect our cet1 ratio to remain at or above capturing the forecasted increase in loan volume as organic earnings growth supports rising loan and investments net interest income is now expected to grow to from the q4 annualized jumping off point our rate outlook includes two 25basis point cuts in the back half of the year nim is expected in the area for the remainder of the year and q2 ending loans balance versus the average for deposits and loans provides continued net interest income momentum for the back half of the year noninterest income should increase to from an adjusted baseline level our upward revision reflects growth in commercial banking fees as well as incremental improvement in other fee segments non interest expense inclusive of the ecrrelated deposit costs is now expected to rise to from an annualized adjusted q4 baseline of billion primarily from the greater ecrrelated deposits which fund attractive balance sheet growth and grow earnings in aggregate these factors should enable wals sustained ppnr to provide the organic capital to support balance sheet growth and the cet1 target while offering us the ability to maneuver around various economic and operating environments asset quality is normalizing from historic lows and net chargeoffs are expected to remain low by industry standards at to basis points of average loans for the year western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 at this time dale tim and i will take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays jared please go ahead your line is now open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc thanks maybe just looking at the loan growth youve had great loan growth obviously this quarter as we go forward any change in sort of the geography of where thats coming you look at the cre portfolio thats been a little bit under pressure should we think that it still is coming from the same primary areas of ci or could there be expansion into some other areas kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thanks for the year and also for the quarter and also yearoveryear majority of our growth has been coming in the ci categories and again thats in no or low loss loan segment and i think were going to continue to move forward in that manner i think what you can expect for the rest of the year is to see a continuous downward movement in our residential loan portfolio as you saw this quarter i think youll find cre overall will be relatively flat we will look for opportunities to finance we do like pockets of financing in the construction land and development most notably weve always talked about this our lot banking segment will provide opportunity but the short answer i guess is that mostly its going to come in ci note financing warehouse lending are the two areas that are going to lead the way jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then just on the fee income side are you assuming i guess youre still assuming that the fed funds cut flowing through to help with mortgage banking there as well i guess whats the trajectory we could expect there following that those two cuts kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp right so for our forecast we have a rate cut in september and a rate cut in december we are forecasting a modestly declining mortgage income mostly because the q4 rate cut wont get it comes in a quarter thats seasonally low in terms of volume so we would expect to see pickup from the rate cut in terms of mortgage western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 volume really to follow into more so for the back end of q4 so basically q4 is a seasonally low quarter to begin with jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks ill step back thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc let me start in the ecr deposits can you just give more color of what drove such strong growth and was the increase in the interest expense on those purely tied to the growth or did the rate the effective rate basically rise as well kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks two questions there so first the growth came in warehouse lending all right and what we have found from the first quarter disruptions in the market that western alliances warehouse lending group has become really the premier platform to hold your escrow accounts on and also come to us for warehouse lending and msr loans so that volume is coming in for that reason also weve had a number of market share gains new clients coming in thats one type of market share gain and existing clients that we currently have have given us more of their deposits so thats the kind of push on that segment which carries a higher ecr now with that liquidity weve been paying down and well continue to pay down our shortterm borrowings and to your other question we do have several initiatives that we are launching to kind of work on the rate and see if we can push that rate downward as we go into q3 and exit q4 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 okay thats helpful ken in terms of the deposit growth getting lifted again were you guys just very conservative is growth coming in much more than you guys expected and its funny when we look at the second half you did billion of deposits in the first half i think youre guiding like billion in the second half i dont know if theres some seasonality in the fourth quarter but are you just being very conservative here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so lets talk about the seasonality first in warehouse lending we see an outflow of deposits every q4 so some of the deposit growth in q1 of was the return of those tax escrow payments that were made and usually that runs between billion and billion that flows out in q4 so why im saying billion net growth then you can see that were accounting for billion to billion thats going to fly out the door or flows out the door at the end in the year where were getting it from is whats interesting is for this quarter as an example of our growth really came from our depositonly channels and so weve launched a number of them as you probably know this is escrow services corporate trust juris banking and of course hoa which started about years ago when i first joined the bank and thats where those deposit vertical growth is coming from in addition our consumer lending or consumer digital platform has really taken off and were doing quite well there and we had another strong quarter in q2 when we saw our deposit growth drawing million so since we actually launched the consumer digital channel ill give you a number as of today because our folks are very proud it they are indiscernible but inside of a yearandahalf that channel has moved up to about billion and just provides another channel for us that we didnt have before at a cost point or price point which is rather consistent with our commercial pricing all right so we dont have a consumer base as you know so we dont have to worry about cannibalizing our consumer base and having them move from low rates to higher rates here its consistent with whats happening in our commercial book and it provides another challenge for us to use almost as a challenger channel to other deposits that are coming in to hold the line or try to push those deposits down over the longterm steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats great color thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp my pleasure operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you i guess maybe as we think about lower rates and the nii outlook dale if you dont mind reminding us including the ecrrelated deposit cost how should we expect sort of nii to trend if the rate cuts from september and december continue to is that positive overall for the nii and nim inclusive of ecr or negative and secondly what determines whether you end up at the which is the for this year on nii outlook western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so yeah regarding your first inquiry ebrahim yeah so were fairly neutral on an aggregate of net interest income plus deposit expenses and then just ken was alluding to earlier with the discussion about our mortgage operation were not sure that thats really going to kick in until we get a little more than one for the fourth quarter and then two moving into the beginning of a little more rate relief on the mortgage rate environment so we feel comfortable where we are and i think within the relative range that were going to see later this year were going to be fairly neutral on im going to say ppnrrelated to interest rate movements both inclusive of interest expense and deposit cost kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and ill take the second part of your question which is what factors influence how we will perform in the second half of the year i think you can expect q3 that youll see net interest income continue to rise and then in q4 you can expect net interest income more or less to be flat to q3 and what are the factors there one is our continued upward movement in loan growth thats very important and overall our total revenue should in q4 should be relatively flat to q3 so we are making up some of the decline in yield by having higher volume in loans and also working other some other feebased channels that we have and then weve been working those feebased channels and developing them over the last year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just a second question ken i do want you to address from a credit standpoint these are really low numbers i get it but its been overhang on the stock for three or four years just talk to us outside of things going through the pie your visibility in terms of credit quality outlook over the next months where do you anticipate some weakness drivers of losses ex all the things that you have said are low loss kind of pieces of the loan book would appreciate that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah im going to let tim take that one timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah thank you so dale i think did a nice job of really covering some key measures of success in the portfolio in his discussion so id start by saying were very pleased with our portfolio performance and then when we when we look forward weve taken every opportunity to describe we focus on early elevation and early resolution so we really take the forwardlooking approach when we view troubled loans portfolio performance and our acl so our forward estimates that ken talked about of to basis points includes all current valuations anticipated value based changes to carry assets that may default and are based on the market conditions that were living in today so we update these values and assess each exposure always on an ongoing basis ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you for taking my questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 operator our next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities brandon please go ahead your line is now open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey just to follow up on the credit conversation so the guide implies some increase in net chargeoffs for second half of the year but i just wanted to get a sense of what changed from last quarter to imply kind of a higher run rate kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think we really look at this all the time as a forwardlooking estimate and we really didnt make a significant change in terms of percentage or dollars we update based on current conditions and well continue to do that so from our standpoint were optimistic and we are maintaining really a stable outlook on our portfolio dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so we update our appraisals on our nonperforming loans approximately every six months and were getting more clarity some of these markets dont have a lot of transactions and so as that comes in we saw something in terms of the san diego property we took that immediately you see that here that put us a little bit above the kind of upper limit that we had as of our first quarter guidance and so we expanded that kind of to brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and just following up on that san diego loan could you expand on kind of the update there news about being foreclosure and kind of your plan to deal with asset kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah look were moving to foreclosure we took the appraisal charge as we described we are going to work to reposition the asset increase occupancy and then well also look to sell the building when we have the occupancy level at a higher level than it is today so its what you would expect anyone to do think of it as you going out and buying a property what would you do to enhance the value thats what were going to be doing brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then just lastly really leaning into some mortgage warehouse deposits any thoughts around concentration levels i know its continuing to creep up there but how do you feel about the concentration of your total deposit base particularly within mortgage warehouse kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 yeah so theres a good news and interesting story here okay the good news is as we continue to become one of the premier platforms in the industry were seeing all those deposits come in thats great we are also getting market share wins that also is great the flip side of that is a higher concentration and so youve seen our hqla grow and so we are not putting all those all that liquidity out to finance loans but rather holding that liquidity on our balance sheet and making a smaller spread what we will do over time is work with our clients to work through our repositioned current pricing models given the liquidity that we have so a year ago there was a premium placed on liquidity and people said if you want my liquidity you have to pay out for it well things have changed a little bit now and as a premier platform i think theres a discount that people have to take when coming to our platform for our service levels so the ability to do multiple things not only handle their escrow deposits but also provide financing and were going to see if they value it that way and so were going to work in that particular segment to scale down or push down some of the rates that were paying dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp the growth weve had is a great problem to have and it gives us flexibility and leverage to be more aggressive in this repricing initiative thats underway brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning im wondering if you can kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc provide us with an update on the large financial institution spend kind of whats left to be done there and im just wondering if the faster growth rate of the balance sheet what that implies for the timing of completion of some of those projects dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so weve indicated in the past that were approximately threequarters of the way through with complying with where we need to be to tip over billion i wouldnt extrapolate too much from our growth rate for the past few quarters and say make that trajectory in terms of where were going to cross over billion we still have at about billion of borrowed funds about billion of broker deposits and were going to be paying that down western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 in a more accelerated fashion so youre going to see our total assets grow at a slower rate than what youve seen for the past few quarters that said though were on track with this were developing whatever plans we need to finally get there we do not see a significant step variable cost in front of us to be able to get over that hump except for potentially what is related with the tlac total lossabsorbing capacity we need to do more debt there but even in that situation based upon indiscernible prototype which i think is being revised we have until to kind of get there timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then maybe just following up on ebrahims question around rates i guess how would the cadence of rate cuts potentially impact your ability to lower ecr costs and benefit some of the other mortgage related activity ie if we just have one rate cut or if the rate cuts are spread out how would that affect your ability to maybe lower some of those ecrrelated expenses dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp look most importantly the indiscernible is broken on rates so theres no places where others can go and get kind of substantially higher rates as we had when we were in an expected higher rate environment if you go to treasuries or some of these other products and be a competitor against deposit rate plus the situation within the banking space has become somewhat more relaxed as well however these are entities that control significant amounts of dollars and so they can get something at or near what would be kind of a market rate of interest but as i said earlier i mean were in a position that we can i think start to kind of use our leverage with our strong balance sheet with our strong delivery system within this space that we think were now kind of the premier player to be able to affect a more significant cost mitigation strategy going forward kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp but a simple answer is as rates move total ecr rates of the fed cuts in september youll see that flow through starting immediately timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then maybe if i could just leave one more question in around mortgage banking there was a comment in the release on maybe elevated loans held for sale and doing more conforming mortgages and then in the deck part of the rationale for the higher fee income guide was that margins are firming up it looks like gain on sale margin actually declined a little bit here but are we starting to reach an equilibrium kind of with the new production i guess what are the expectations for gain on sale margins in the context of the decline kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so gain on sale margins in q1 were higher than q2 in q2 you saw mortgage rates move back up above theyre firming now and we are optimistic but we dont have it captured into our forecast yet that as more people get comfortable that rate cuts are coming and with the shortage of supply and housing in the market that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 more people will start returning youre seeing a little pickup now in refi activity while were looking forward to the purchase activity to really drive us but from a forecast point of view were going to wait to see that flow through our pl before we capture it in our goforward consensus outlook timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the color kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp youre welcome operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead your line is now open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning thanks for the questions maybe just on the margin held up a little better than expected up bps i think you had guided previously down and thats despite kind of loans earning assets coming down updated thoughts on kind of the nearterm margin outlook dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we did pop it up basis point and again with the excess liquidity we did two things a lot of excess liquidity came in towards the back end of the first quarter so we were able to deploy average earning assets that help and then also were paying down our and working hard to pay down our shortterm borrowing as i said in my prepared remarks going forward q3 q4 you could see net interest margin holding very close to where we are now in the area and that includes the two rate cuts matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great yeah got it and then just shifting gears to credit any color on the uptick in special mention this quarter what drove that increase dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah really its a balance with the prior fourth quarter to last year so were down from where we spent most of the year last year slight uptick and its just part of our early elevation as part of our ongoing review processes id say that it was idiosyncratic or specific deal situations that brought credit into view and then we will quickly as we always do work through those to move them up or out kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i would note that whether youre looking at the special mention ratio or total dollars q2 is still below the trailing four quarter averages so nothing out of the ordinary in that special mention move western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great thank you operator our next question comes from bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead your line is now open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning so just a question on your interest rate sensitivity disclosures i believe you might have made some changes in the disclosure versus the 10k given more granular assumptions on the deposit betas so for basis points decline of rates you showed nii down about at million but wonder if you could update that at million and believe nii could come in better given higher expected loan growth and benefit from wholesale deposit repricing so just wanted to see if you could provide some puts and takes there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well okay so net interest income should come in higher because of what you just said but the volatility around that on a different interest rate assumption again this is the shock that we show its probably going to be fairly similar to what we showed you in the first quarter not a whole lot of difference there and again i mean we look at it really looking at net interest income plus the delta that were going to see in deposit cost which is going to have kind of the opposite effect and so the net between them gets to a fairly stable ill call net interest related items in ppnr combining of those two elements bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it and then just separately just on the fee income just a question on this i know the equity investments were about million which were much lower in the previous two quarters and i think there theres some benefits on one income in the prior quarters just wondering if you can provide any color and expectations from here going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thats a difficult thing to for us to really prognosticate and so we have equity positions in more than companies and which ones pop or which ones close is a process on how that looks i mean there is some correlation with maybe ma activity thats been a little restrained for reasons that i think everyone is aware of so maybe thats been a factor here i cant really project what its going to be in third and fourth quarter other than we dont see any really change going on so maybe weve got the parameters of where the higher or lower areas could be and maybe somewhere in there but theres nothing going on there that we think is going to be magnitude change either better or worse respectively bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thanks for taking my questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks dale when i look at your guide and the ranges in your guide it would seem that if youre at the midpoint of nii youll probably be at the midpoint of the expenses or at the high end is there any is there a scenario where youre perhaps at the high end of expenses and maybe the midpoint of nii or should we just think about them whatever our assumptions are they should be kind of consistent dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i wouldnt put too much interdependence on the elements in here there is a correlation obviously if net interest income moves up what does that mean is that a relatively higher either rates overall maybe fewer rate cuts andor better growth and that can affect what was going on the expense side but in total i mean i think these parameters are reasonably pretty fair i mean if anything were maybe we think were going to do a little better on the noninterest income side maybe toward the upper end of that range but the others i think kind of a midpoint is fairly on target with what we would consider christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thanks and then on the just going back to the balance sheet strategy you talked about the expense build and hqla and tlac the capital target the plus that youve been with for the better part of the year is there a scenario where that changes in your view materially either way now that youre kind of through the worst of the crisis and were a little bit more confident in the outlook kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp chris you blanked out we missed the first part of that question can you repeat it for us please christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh sure i guess just closing the loop on the billion investment discussion is there a scenario where your cet1 target i guess would move materially one way or the other i guess is the question kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so you want to keep the as a target more like a floor that weve said before growth that were generating from earnings are going to be used to fund loan growth so the progression from the cet1 level upwards is going to be slower its not going to be as rapid as youve seen in the last six or seven quarters and if youre asking is there a stock repurchase program in our immediate future the answer would be no because unlike many of our peers we have a higher degree of comfort regarding loan growth coming from these low or no loss loan categories that we think over the longterm will propel the company forward at a faster rate for eps so thats what we plan to do christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 yeah i actually wasnt for this time wasnt asking about the buyback it was just more about balance sheet leverage and growth but got you on there thanks ken kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay got it all right sorry operator our next question comes from samuel varga with ubs please go ahead your line is now open samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning i wanted to ask a question about the corporate trust business could you give us an update on where things stand and sort of where are the pipelines youd mentioned that the investment grade rating is the catalyst here can you just give a broad update on where that business is at dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i think were the only bank im pretty sure were the only bank that has had positive ratings actions if you want to call them that from either fitch or from moodys so were both on outlook positive obviously our ratings are not where we believe they should be but we think that is encouraging in terms of direction we have gotten certainly good traction in our corporate trust operation and weve tagteamed with our corporate finance group and deliver a combined product set for clo administration which we think has been helpful so were really quite optimistic of what that looks like while i would be glad to have a ratings increase from both of those entities we dont think its necessary for us to continue to grow strongly in that category we have more than billion in deposits there presently kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so i was on the road last week with the corporate trust group and our lender finance group and combining those two together when calling on clients has put a pipeline of deals ready to close now do not mean these deals have been mandated to us of about theres like a pipeline of clients that got to close and so putting those two things together has been very very valuable where we have the ability to make investments or lend on the lender finance side and as we do that we expect the mandate on the corporate trust side but whats more importantly is the corporate trust program that we built we took a few people from a large money center bank after chatting with them during the interview process i said what is needed to make this program successful and it really was rebuilding the technology the architecture thats currently out there and a higher level of customer service and i can tell you from the five or six calls i had last week thats exactly how our clients feel about us that we have the better technology in the industry and the service levels are meeting their expectations is actually not exceeding them so its pretty exciting for us were going to see how this thing moves forward this is a build so our corporate trust group in terms of deposits should do between million to million on average a quarter and as our name gets out there and we continue to expand the group i would hope for bigger and better things as we move into but right now very very pleased with that activity western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that update and then just trying to switch back to ecr deposits for one last question on that dale if i understand correctly the mortgage warehouse deposits are sort of pulling up that paid rates is it fair to assume that if seasonality comes through and those deposits partially flow out that that alone will be enough to reduce the ecr rate regardless of whether we actually get cuts or not dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp sure sure so first off i mean as ken alluded to earlier were expecting or a little bit above deposit beta or i would say funding costs beta on the ecrs as rates come down and so if you get that effect and then coupled with an expected outflow seasonally not related to relationships in the fourth quarter those should have a combined effect going from say a rate cut at their meeting in september into the fourth quarter lower rate and lower balances youre going to see a drop in noninterest expense kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp which gives us the confidence level that our eps as we move through q3 and into q4 will be on an upward trajectory which is what weve been communicating since the beginning part of the year samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for all the color i appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thanks couple of questions here can you guys talk about the competitive environment in your mortgage businesses seems like its changed you kind of alluded to it youve taken share just curious what happens when volumes pick up and how you take advantage of that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay so what im talking about is the warehouse funding group not the amerihome group all right thats going to be more and more dependent jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 but in the warehouse lending group weve seen a couple of competitors recently drop out of the market one has said that theyre selling loans one sold loans and whats most important to our clients and maybe this is really when people always say why is it that you guys grow while others dont well first is that were a commercial bank and were national and we just dont stick to a region so thats one answer the second answer is we dont move in and out of markets and people can count on us to always be there now terms and conditions may change because economic conditions change but we dont pull out of the market and then jump back in and our clients remember that especially around warehouse lending where those lines sometimes can get shut down rather quickly and larger banks can make a determination whether or not they want to be in the business or not and thats a little bit more serendipitous for us we want to be in the business and we let the economic terms and operating conditions tell us what it is we need to charge and how to be there to support our clients and i think thats one of the reasons why weve become the premier goto platform in that segment jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc theres been a lot of discussion on interest rates what do you guys prefer from a rate perspective do you want a couple of cuts do you want more than a couple of cuts whats ideal for you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp oh boy thats a question for me and my therapist but for the most part if rates keep coming down at a faster pace what we would look for is the mortgage fee income to rise and that we can bring in volume on the loan side to help offset some of the rate decline that you would see on our loan portfolio and that would be our approach dale do you have a different opinion dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no i agree i the other thing i would say is is theres been a little bit of a we can still say this right the chinese water torture on cre in particular related to a higher rate environment where debt service cost is just has become burdensome over time and its whittled away at dscrs debt service coverage ratios over the past few years and ltv as cap rates decline so relief on that i think would give the whole industry a little bit more headroom in terms of npa materialization and issues related to maintaining strong asset quality jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay fair enough on that and then dale just a quick one on the provision given the updated chargeoff guide and the growth guide i think it suggests a relatively stable provision am i looking at it the right way or is there something else to consider dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i think thats fair i would say however i mean look weve had good loan growth weve had our loantodeposit ratio on a marginal basis for the past couple of quarters has been very low we kind of climbed into our comfort level in terms of our liquidity profile so if we had higher loan growth how cecl works of course that demands a load up on provisioning cost irrespective of what earnings youve been able to draw from that in the present period western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp which you saw in this quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right okay all right sure enough thank you dale m
