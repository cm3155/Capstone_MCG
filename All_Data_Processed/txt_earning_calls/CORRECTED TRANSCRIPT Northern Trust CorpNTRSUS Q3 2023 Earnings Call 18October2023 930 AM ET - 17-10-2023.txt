mike ogrady michael g ogrady chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you jennifer let me join in welcoming you to our third quarter earnings call our results for the third quarter reflect solid execution against the challenging phase of this interest rate cycle particularly as rates appear close to be peaking third quarter deposit levels were generally in line with seasonal expectations but funding costs were significantly higher putting pressure on net interest income were focusing primarily on those areas of the business that are most under our control namely trust fees and expenses in those two areas were pleased with our performance trust fee revenue was up both sequentially and yearoveryear expenses were well controlled and we improved our capital position our wealth management business grew trust fees on both a sequential and yearoveryear basis we saw ongoing strength in the higher wealth tiers and within our global family office segment our momentum outside the us continues to be brisk families with large and complex trust structures continued to be an area where we excel activity with business owners also remained robust helping them optimize their complex personal affairs while they attend to growing their businesses is a consistent theme were also seeing early success with various new marketing approaches and referral sources in particular during the third quarter we had healthy new business generation with clients with assets over million in asset management we saw positive flows into our institutional money market platform for the third consecutive quarter relative to benchmarks our taxadvantaged equity product performance remained strong within the quarter cementing its one three and fiveyear track record of outperformance importantly two recent large asset servicing wins contain asset management mandates for indexed fixed income and outsourced investment solutions reinforcing our combined strength as one northern within asset servicing we had good momentum in core custody and fund administration and our pipeline remained solidly within historical levels our front office solutions is resonating particularly well across regions and different client types one notable front office solutions win in the third quarter was the billion abu dhabi pension fund our ability to provide a comprehensive view across public and private assets was cited as a key differentiator importantly we were also selected to provide global custody liquidity management performance and risk analytics and portfolio optimization we also had good success in the us asset owner space where we continued to take share in closing we enter the fourth quarter on solid footing our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample capital and liquidity and our credit quality remains excellent new business momentum is healthy and our pipeline is robust expense growth has declined each quarter this year and im confident it will continue to build on this northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 discipline were well positioned to navigate the current uncertain environment including the proposed regulatory changes related to capital and longterm debt and generate value for our stakeholders ill now turn the call over to jason jason j tyler executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our third quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported third quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was our assets under custodyadministration and assets under management were down modestly on a sequential basis but up sharply on a yearoveryear basis unfavorable markets and currency movements more than offset positive asset inflows relative to the prior period yearoveryear levels benefited from favorable markets currency improvements and asset inflows on a year overyear basis currency movements had an approximate 90basispoint favorable impact on revenue growth largely within our asset services division and 100basispoint unfavorable impact on expenses on a sequential basis currency impacts were immaterial excluding notable items in all periods revenue was down on both a sequential quarter and yearoveryear basis expenses were up sequentially and up over the prior year this reflects an expense to trust fee ratio of down from sic in the second quarter but higher than the sic we posted in the third quarter of last year pretax income was up sequentially but down over the prior year trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion a sequential increase and a increase compared to last year all other noninterest income was up sequentially but down over the prior year net interest income on an fte basis was million down sequentially and down from a year ago our provision for credit losses was million in the third quarter overall our credit quality remains very strong with small net recoveries for the quarter and there was a modest increase in nonperforming loans turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend down sequentially but up yearoveryear asset servicing fees totaled million custody and fund administration fees the largest component of fees in the business were million sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business activity offset by weaker transaction volume the yearoveryear strength was due to solid new business activity and favorable market and currency impacts that were partially offset by lower transaction volume assets under management for asset servicing clients were billion down sequentially but up year overyear similarly because of the significant portion of our fees are billed on a lagged basis the sequential decline in aum will impact our fourth quarter trust fees investment management fees within asset servicing were million moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients was billion trust administration and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were million northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 our average balance sheet decreased on a linkedquarter basis primarily due to lower client deposits client liquidity was essentially flat during third quarter average deposits were billion down billion or sequentially in line with our expectations for this seasonably weaker quarter the decline was seen largely in the interestbearing channel as clients continued to reallocate cash positions noninterestbearing deposits remained stable down less than billion sequentially and the mix held steady at at quarterend operational deposits remained at approximately twothirds of institutional deposits and institutional deposits comprised to of the total mix shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet the duration of the securities portfolio reduced slightly to years the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year loan balances averaged billion and were flat sequentially our loan portfolio is well diversified across geographies operating segments and loan types approximately of the loan portfolio is floating and the overall duration is below one year our liquidity remained strong cash held at the fed and other central banks was down reflecting the absorption of the deposit decreases but highly liquid assets comprised more than of our deposits and nearly of total earning assets net interest income on an fte basis was million for the quarter down sequentially and down from the prior year nii reflected the impact of several dynamics we saw some continued client migration into higher yielding cash alternatives but the pace moderated as we expected deposit cost increases were slightly bigger factor with funding costs up basis points over the second quarter due to the competitive environment we repriced a small number of meaningful products to ensure were protecting deposit volumes were not price leaders but were vigorously defending our deposits with an eye toward playing the long game we expect to benefit from this strategy when rates decline client engagement also led to a combination of specific repricing on existing accounts and a shift to higherpaying term deposits theres no question that clients want to remain on our balance sheet but sensing that the rate cycle is close to peaking theyve begun to stretch for duration our nii in the fourth quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior which has been less predictable given the speed and extent of this cycles rate hikes our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are billion modest outflows are expected to continue due in part to client efforts to optimize returns and to some known outflows related to ma activity and other corporate needs pricing should remain under pressure with further nim compression possible we currently expect fourth quarter nii to be in the range of million to million factors that could swing the outcome include the pace of further deposit outflows the level of price pressure the extent to which we continue to see deposit mix shift and the offsetting impact from the repricing of the securities portfolio as we look out to there are wide range of scenarios under which net interest income could trend deposit pricing pressure our securities maturity schedule investment outlook and other factors provide upside thats not reflected in the current quarter turning to page as reported noninterest expenses were billion in the third quarter down sequentially but up as compared to the prior year excluding unusual items in both periods including those noted on the slide expenses in the third quarter were up sequentially and up over yearoveryear northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 ill hit on just a few highlights excluding unusual items compensation expense was down sequentially this reflected reductions in incentive compensation and head count actions taken yeartodate the increase over the last year reflects base pay adjustments excluding unusual items in all periods noncompensation expense was up sequentially our expense to trust fee ratio improved basis points sequentially to but remains higher than our targeted range of to as a reminder we began the year expecting to take at least basis points off of our adjusted expense growth rate of our first quarter adjusted results were meaningfully better up yearoveryear our second quarter adjusted results were even better up yearoveryear and our third quarter results were in the same range despite unfavorable currency impacts for the fourth quarter we expect continued improvement compensation expense is expected to be up million benefits expense should be our normal fourth quarter lift of million to million outside services likely to be up approximately million equipment and software should be up approximately million relative to adjusted third quarter levels and occupancy is expected to increase a few million dollars above adjusted third quarter levels other operating expense has many components including marketdriven categories that are not predictable but it has tended to increase in the fourth quarter all in this would put our full year adjusted expense growth rate at approximately or roughly basis points lower than levels our financial model is based upon midsingledigit trust fee growth from a combination of organic growth and market appreciation against this backdrop we hope to generate basis points to basis points in trust fee operating leverage in normal macro environment our capital levels and ratios remained strong in the quarter we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimum our common equity tier ratio under the standardized approach was up slightly from the prior quarter to as capital accretion more than offset the unfavorable impact from higher rates on our securities portfolio this reflects a 440basispoint buffer above our regulatory requirements our tier leverage ratio was up basis points from the prior quarter at quarterend our aoci was a negative billion a slight improvement over second quarter levels we returned million to common shareholders through cash dividends of million and common stock repurchases of million we slowed our buyback activity in order to reserve for the anticipated fdic special assessment were well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements that mike referenced without significant changes to our operating model and with that melissa please open the line for questions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and we can go with our first question from glenn schorr with evercore jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi wow it sounds like it sounds like the price is right i like it okay so i appreciate the range of outcomes for nii next year that you cant control so well leave that aside for a sec but you mentioned your expense to trust fee ratio your target and what you can do in terms of operating leverage in a better environment or a normal environment im curious just whats the overall approach to expenses as you enter budget season next year within that mindset of what your goals are how do you approach it with that much uncertainty around things that you cant control jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah well as we enter this is the time of year where were thinking trying to get a sense of where the launch points will be and i walked through a little bit of a financial model for you guys to think about that if were over time well get lift from the equity markets and we should also have low to midsingledigit organic growth if we can get to basis points in fee operating leverage that sets us up really well based on where our pretax margin is for good eps growth over time and so thats the goal that we its one of the metrics that we look at really closely and were still in an inflationary environment where its harder to get that operating leverage if youre just looking at fees because the expenses are elevated and you dont get the benefit from higher rates on the trust fee line but you can tell that weve spent an incredible amount of effort this year working the yearoveryear expense growth rates down and you go back to and printing a growth coming into this year we knew we had to do better than that and weve been grinding that down each quarter quarter after quarter we first tackled it with working hard on labor and you can see thats the biggest cost that we have so we have to get that right head counts down and then another key element is technology that shows up in equipment software and outside services thats still elevated above the rest of the company in terms of growth rate but weve had a lot of accomplishments there too and expecting to have that growth rate be lower next year than it has historically and so we think we can have another year next year thats similar to what we did in this year which is to work that continue to work that yearoveryear growth rate down glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 exactly what i was looking for thank you you have tons of capital and youve generated plenty also but im curious some of the big banks have articulated what they thought as is that the rwa impact or allin impact might be im curious at your first glance what type of impacts are we talking i know that you mentioned it doesnt disrupt your model and i agree im just curious if you can help us box it in in terms of ph all three impact if as is thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure yeah im going to give you a wide range like to in rwa and thats going to be impacted by a few different things but one of the benefits that we have is the diversification of the business model and so weve got obviously the custody business comes with a lot of operational risks thats really the most significant driver but well actually get some benefit from an rwa perspective in some of the loan treatments just given the nature of our underlying loans and then there are some other dynamics that we have that should help on rwa as well on a relative basis but its worth thinking about at this point it could be anywhere from to but as we mentioned earlier feel really comfortable and we see where our cet1 levels are and see where our liquidity is and so well keep an eye on where our peers are well keep an eye on what the business is doing but weve got flexibility and other ways to manage that dynamic as well glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats great thanks for all that appreciate it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure thanks glenn operator we can take our next question from michael brown with kbw jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning mike michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning everyone so i guess i wanted to start on the custody and fund admin fees they were essentially flat quarteroverquarter and i guess a little bit softer than we expected what were some of the key drivers that played out this quarter and as you noted the lower market levels present a bit of a headwind here for the fourth quarter but you did talk about some positive dynamics on the new business front so what are the puts and takes that we should think about here for the fourth quarter and then heading into next year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so first of all the if you just look at the custody and fund admin line and split it wed talked about the fact that currency on a sequential basis was effectively a push yearoveryear it helped more than that roughly in the neighborhood of to but if we just go back and look sequentially at how the quarter looked the net new northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 business in custody and fund admin fees was a positive it was lowsingle digits very low single digits but positive and then transaction volumes continue to be light and were starting to talk about that dynamic as something that might be more longterm just as our clients move more toward more indexing as opposed to active management theres less trading activity theres less reporting theres less transitions and so we did were continuing to see a lower level of transactionrelated activity but the overall business is strong again net positive from an overall net new business perspective and the pipeline as mike mentioned looks strong michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then if we just change gears to the deposit side it sounds like the pressure there still remains can you just maybe unpack some of those underlying dynamics by client type and maybe just touch on where the pressure is perhaps the greatest and maybe where theres a bit less of a challenge and are you seeing some elements of the deposit base that are seeing stabilization here or is it really kind of across the board jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp definitely feel it stabilized in a lot of ways its hard to predict where its going to go because obviously its been a volatile cycle and clients are clearly trying to figure out what to do from here theres a lot of clients that are terming out their deposits we saw in the wealth side just to get at your question of how its separated by channel the wealth side we saw a significant increase in term deposits so clients are saying this is an opportunity to move out of checking and into cds and a part of that is the nature of our clients where they have large amounts of deposits and so they can take a component of their deposits and think about that more strategically and less about the need to maintain that liquidity just for daytoday payments but interestingly on the wealth side deposits were actually up if you look to theyre up somewhat and so it gives us an indication that the pricing actions we took worked really well clients are they continue to see the strength of the balance sheet they like to deposit on northern trust balance sheet so that increase was meaningful in the institutional side thats what drove the periodtoperiod and most of the average decline and that comes to a lot of clients is moving to different types of either longerduration or higheryielding liquidity types overall liquidity across the company was flat across the channels cumulatively and so clients clearly are just saying northern is the right place to be theyre moving from one overall liquidity mechanism to another and as we look out i think its interesting to see that the balances thus far in the quarter have held in just over billion and frankly thats higher and its still early in the quarter but its higher than what we would have anticipated at this point and the million to million just to give some context there that assumes that net interest margin would be relatively flat up a couple to a few basis points but deposits would have to come down and average in the billion to billion for us to get down to that million to million and so at this point thus far again its very were weeks in to a 13week quarter the deposit levels are holding in higher than that michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for all the color jason northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator and our next question will come from alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey jason good morning hey mike as well so just like another one around deposits you guys seemed to have been a bit surprised i guess by this latest move in terms of kind of the catchup that you played there you articulated at the conference in september and obviously today do you feel like you caught up to where institutional pricing is or do you still think theres might be incremental migration or kind of the need to increase price more and then again on the institutional side of things is there a particular client base or channel internationally that is driving this pickup or is that fairly broad based because your competitor said that is fairly limited right i mean we know theres three or four and at the end of the day thats who you compete with on the custody side so im just kind of curious where we are in that process jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp it seems like we caught up and we made if we get to why we we thought we were going to be down about in nii we ended up down we saw that midquarter and hit right on the number so what happened in call it the august timeframe we clearly saw that in general the market was taking deposit pricing up and we reacted to that again were not price makers were price takers and so we reacted to that and it seems to very much have leveled out the deposit activity and thats why you see things very kind of flattish and then also ended this quarter stabilizing at levels we thought would be even higher and so i think the big takeaway is it seems like the pricing is where it needs to be for clients to level things out and the pricing actions that we took were in pretty small number but of big accounts and you asked about kind of geography the bigger actions we took were in the us custody book on the institutional side of the business and then in wealth it was in mmda and so we took a targeted approach to increase those pricings and early reactions look like we got it we hit the mark well alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right thanks shifting gears a little bit pretty constructive comments from you guys on the new business we heard that for the last couple of quarters as you know converting that to fees is always a little hard and its a bit opaque so any way you can frame maybe the fee backlog and as we sort of work that through into revenues over the next call it months do you feel like you have enough scale in the business to onboard especially some of these larger mandates without a material pickup in expenses so in other words to glenns northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 point it sounds like you guys are aiming for i dont know to expense growth in is that doable with potentially more net new business jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp it is and we didnt give a number on the expense growth just that we want to do better than what we did this year and so with that backdrop the growth in the asset servicing business in particular has come with expenses its a less scalable business relative to wealth which is obviously highly highly scalable that said were focused as you can tell from what weve done this year not just on top line growth but on managing the type of business that comes in and so thats why head count was such an incredible focus for us this year the compensation line an incredible focus and so as we look at what business to bring on board theres going to be a very strong scrutiny on looking at what expenses come along with it the business is committed to do that theyre leading that effort saying that theyre going to be very diligent about identifying what business to bring on michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah and alex i would just add to what jason is saying there thats why were driving so hard on productivity as well is because we have to have the capacity to invest in the foundation of the business and what were building out the investments we need to make but then also to your point if youre going to bring on new business that has resources you have to be able to offset a portion of that as well alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay that all makes sense and sorry i didnt mean to put words in your mouth on the to as it sounds like less than so maybe michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp no no alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe wishful thinking okay all right i appreciate it michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp its a good test thanks operator our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp morning brennan northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning yeah good morning jason how are you doing would love to unpack a little bit because i you walked through some of the it sounds like you walked through some of the underlying assumptions behind the million to million expectation for it sounded like you were saying that it predicated a deposit base of billion to billion and nim flat did i interpret that correctly and does that suggest that youre sort of girding for further deposit declines even though theyve been stable quartertodate jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp just to tweak the words i mentioned that implies nim would be up a few basis points but the deposit levels you mentioned are accurate and so coming last quarter we came into it thinking were going to be down the market ended up being more competitive and again weve got to react to what the markets doing we dont set it and so coming into this quarter we did prepare for further decline in deposits and that could easily still happen so not walking that back which is saying that early stages of the quarter are indicating the deposit levels are higher than that and weve also got even as we look out to next year we dont think about this million to million as the run rate of nii theres reasons for us to believe that nii is going to go up from there and just that you look at the runoff in the securities portfolio and were still trading securities that are yielding and reinvesting it at and securities yielding in the and reinvesting it above that and so without taking more risk or duration and so there are things that we can continue to do weve also had the balance sheet positioned very defensively and we saw the decline in deposits that was happening and frankly the stress in the banking industry in the spring and in the summer and we positioned very defensively we wanted to we have the ability to do that based on the strength of the balance sheet we can stay short we cannot stretch for nii but as we feel more confident about the stability of deposits the stability of the industry we can use nonhqla capacity and so theres multiple levers we have to work on nii for it so although were trying to give you as much color as we can about fourth quarter the interpretation shouldnt be that thats necessarily something that you should annualize thinking about brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all thats fair i guess the will depend on the competition for deposits so well see how that goes so one followup here you guys made reference and i apologize if you said it in the prepared remarks theres a couple overlapping calls here this morning but you laid out a visa gain in the press release but i didnt hear it quantified in the commentary is it possible to quantify that impact jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its up million to million relative to second quarter second quarter was a slight loss this was a slight gain and that just a little bit of color that relates to a derivative that we have associated with part of our visa position and as our view of the length of that swap extends or reduces that has an impact to the markto market northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 and as there was news that was proposed by or theres news that was put out this quarter of visa saying that they have a shareholder proposal to release half the shares it reduces the amount of time in that swap and so therefore it changed the mark from what it otherwise would be brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from ryan kenny with morgan stanley ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning so just when thinking through the puts and takes to nii you mentioned taking securities yielding and reinvesting at could you just update us on how much afs and htm rolloff youre expecting per quarter going forward and as those securities mature are you mostly reinvesting that onto cash jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i want to make sure i got the question fully can you repeat it for me you just came through a little soft i want to make sure i got it ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so as youre reinvesting securities from into could you let us know just how much afs and htm rolloff youre expecting per quarter and are you reinvesting that onto cash jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure a lot of the reinvestment recently has been in cash and ph i began as i mentioned just a few minutes ago thats not necessarily where well be reinvesting it before and as we look at the schedule it probably averages the runoff averages about particularly and lets just take the us dollardenominated amounts and then overall theres about close to a little over billion a quarter across all the currencies thats maturing thats reinvesting ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 operator and moving on to our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thanks good morning hey good morning folks thanks for taking my question just one clarification on the other investment in or the other income that was the million this quarter versus million in the second quarter should we take that million and think of that as a more normalized run rate given the noise on the visa swap gain jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah i think that visa is going to at some point in time i think the noise in that line item will just go away and theres visa did announce that they did make this announcement and so that should have an impact on the swap at some point and so i think it shouldnt be again it has tended to be a negative that negative will go away and so the prior run rates are probably too low and the current run rate might be too high is the best way to think about it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay fair enough on that and then just on the nii guide just to clarify also the million to million is that fte and then well let me just ask that first thats fte correct jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay great and then just as we move into some of the elements obviously a lot of wide ranges of what can potentially happen but on the competition front sounded like that was fairly episodic this third quarter it got resolved and just sort of i guess your view on whether you think that might reemerge of course its always tough to predict but just in terms of the fact that youre able to defend it with higher rates but keep those deposits would that seemingly be a disincentive for other providers to try to grab those deposits and not actually get them and then what would you think of maybe its tough to answer too but what level of deposits is at risk of that competition within the custody and the wealth business jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 in the institutional business lets start there that a lot of those deposits are there for clients to be processing payments and they not only have the endofday deposit needs but intraday needs as they have they can have intraday overdrafts and so theyve got to think about their liquidity not just end of the day but intraday and we process a tremendous amount of payments across the system and so thats why we always are talking about not just the traditional operational component but the amount of dollars and velocity that we have in the asset servicing business which is very high the amounts that are more sensitive to rates tend to be very large clients that are making a decision on where to park large amounts of dollars and those tend to be negotiated and thats the thats kind of the top end but thats also where theres lighter spread in the wealth side of the business clients are making decisions more from a product perspective and theyre moving between term treasuries money market funds and traditional checking accounts and weve seen increases in all nonchecking account areas over this cycle and weve seen cds go from less than billion to close to billion and that obviously has a really big impact when you think that thats coming from a traditional checking account into a market rate cd theres basis points of difference and so if it gives you a little bit of a sense of on the wealth side if weve talked about of the deposits overall that we have are in institutional and in wealth and then you see the type of movement that can happen if were talking about billion billion billion of movement of that billion to billion base its pretty meaningful but its the good news is it has stayed with us and weve done a good job of holding on to the deposits again its been deposits up this past quarter and overall client liquidity for the business flat from one quarter to another brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes thats great color thank you very much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi yeah im a little confused on the nii guidance so youre looking to be down to in the fourth quarter to million to million but you said dont take that as a run rate and so what kind of run rate do you think youll have because i guess youre guiding down nii yearoveryear in the fourth quarter so how much of that do you think youd get back as you take those securities reinvestment and take all your other actions and do you think the fourth quarter will be the low point or the nii inflection comes later or just a little bit more color on that if you could northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah sure no fourth quarter could be it could definitely be a low point and particularly thinking about some of the things that we mentioned but just taking the securities runoff alone the math gets to you get to over call it a million million million lift per quarter coming from just the securities maturing and reinvesting again in similar duration similar credit profile and thats without us taking these other actions and just as our clients are thinking about where are we in the yield in the overall rate cycle we think about that as well and weve again we positioned weve had the balance sheet positioned in a pretty defensive manner and this provides us an opportunity to start thinking about what do we do differently but just the maturity schedule alone has kind of a call it a million annualized lift to it and thats just one of the levers that we have that well be working from mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc in light of just more headwinds though than you had expected i know you said no more expense plans but and you have kind of indiscernible cost curve which is the expression i guess of the year any thoughts of tightening up expenses even more than youve already done jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah the productivity office we launched just in this year from kind of a standing start and were going to get over million within this million of savings in this year most of those are on a recurring basis and so you see a lot of that reflected in the actions we took from a compensation perspective but negotiations with consulting firms how were looking at demand for technology consumption how were managing real estate and so weve pulled a lot of levers there and couldnt have a higher sense of urgency on what were thinking about from a productivity perspective but we should be getting above a year in help from productivity and were not going to stop uncovering opportunities and having difficult conversations about what we can stop doing or how we can be thinking about things differently michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp mike definitely continued focus on productivity as jason is saying so just want to emphasize that point there are still plenty of opportunities to functionalize automate centralize a number of different ill call it more fundamental structural things that were doing already but just have longer time frames to implement them in order to get those savings longerterm and a lot around technology that enables that so it absolutely has been a focus but will continue to be a focus particularly as the environment is so uncertain and not necessarily knowing what the direction of whether its rates or markets are going to be mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 sure operator and our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jason how are you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp very well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys can we take a step back were obviously all in the weeds in the quartertoquarter stuff for all of the banks understandably so but when you step back if were now after when was it since the financial crisis lets call it years of a incredibly low interest rate environment with a little blip up in of course but if were now in a new environment for the next three to five years where the short end of the curve stays above or maybe even for nobody knows for sure how does that maybe alter the way you guys have been running the business for the last years in a rate environment to one now that is going to be basis points to basis points higher at the front end of the curve or does it alter the way you run the business michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp gerard its mike appreciate the question and the answer is yes it does alter the way that we have to look at the business and just starting with some of your comments there just around low interest rate environment higher interest rate environment what aspects to that are cyclical versus maybe permanent changes jason mentioned some of the shifts in the way institutional investors invest and the implications on transaction volumes that may come with that and as a result beyond looking at the productivity of the business which i think weve emphasized here we also have to look at the pricing side of the business to ensure that we are being appropriately compensated for all the high value added services that were providing ill say to all our clients because it really isnt specific to just institutional clients or wealth clients but if there was an expectation that you were managing a certain level of deposits as a part of an overall relationship that was a part of the value you were receiving for all the services youre providing if thats going to be different for some time period then you have to be compensated in different ways now you know our model well enough to know its not a consumer product or something where you change the pricing daily or even monthly so its something that you have to work through the longerterm way that your northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 services are priced and the way relationships work i mean were always looking to retain relationships but also very focused on expanding them and the more we can do with the clients the better the overall economics so my point which i think youre on to it is we do and have been looking at this holistically both on the revenue side and on the expense side so that we can continue to look at meeting the financial targets that we have gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you mike and then as a followup jason you were talking about obviously youre approaching your budgeting season and im not asking you to obviously tell us whats going on yet but can you frame out for us a year ago this time when you were doing the budgeting for and as you pointed out you guys have made progress in reducing expense rate of growth but can you frame out for us the outside factors that you were dealing with last year at this time whether it is wage inflation or just inflation in general versus today is it a little easier today or no just as tough the outside factors havent really changed and its going to be a tough environment to put together a budget jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp last year we were in a heavy heavy inflationary environment that was hitting us in not just our labor costs but also we were defending from others trying to take our talent a lot was one of the talking points that we had at the time that had implications and we were just spending time on that as well and then we were seeing inflation come and technology costs in a lot of different ways so every budget year is really really difficult i have to say that the macro headwinds last year i feel were heavier than they are this year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good
