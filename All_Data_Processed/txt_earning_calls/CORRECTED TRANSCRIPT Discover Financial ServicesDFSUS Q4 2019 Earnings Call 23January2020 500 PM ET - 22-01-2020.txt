reviewing the highlights and key performance metrics for the full year then turn the call over to john to review fourth quarter results as well as our guidance elements for was another very good year for discover with net income of billion aftertax or per share and a healthy return on equity of these results reflect our business model that brings together the positive attributes of high return consumer lending and direct banking with the benefits and longterm potential of owning our own global network our robust returns allowed us flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders while continuing to make important investments in the discover brands advanced technology and expanding our acceptance globally these investments have further strengthened our competitive position in and set us up for continued strong returns in and beyond looking at some of the specifics total loans grew in line with our expectations and credit performance was also on target as we benefited from the continued strength of the us consumer and ongoing advances in our risk discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 management and servicing capabilities we achieved a robust net interest margin of and operating expenses remained in our targeted range economists are forecasting continued growth in the economic environment in however given the unprecedented duration of the economic expansion we will manage credit with that in mind we continue to invest in our global payments business in focusing on expanding acceptance by adding network partners and relationships with acquirers in key markets like the uk new zealand france and spain our payment services segment generated a increase in pretax income primarily driven by strong volume gains from our pulse business the team at pulse had a great year adding volume from acquirers in both existing and new issuers turning to slide we had solid loan growth in all our products with total loans and card loans both up in our card business the majority of this growth was in higheryielding merchandise balances as opposed to promotional activity reflecting strong card member engagement we continue to introduce features and service enhancements that are relevant to customers and prospects including for example leveraging merchant partnerships to provide even greater value to our card members we also had a good year in our student lending business with organic receivables up loan growth is benefiting from increased awareness of the discover brand enhancements to acquisition models and improvements in the conversion process we continue to benefit from our strong position as the second largest provider of private student loans our personal loan portfolio grew in a touch above our expectation our investments in analytics and modeling have had a significant impact on our personal loan credit performance enabling us to increase originations while maintaining an acceptable level of credit risk turning to slide credit performed very well in and was in line with our expectations the seasoning of loans from recent vintages was the primary driver as the impact of normalization in the consumer credit industry continues to abate as i said earlier we feel good about the underlying economic and credit trends as we enter and well have more to say about the overall credit environment when we discuss fourth quarter performance and guidance later in the call before i turn the call over to john i want to wrapup by saying how excited i am about our prospects for continuing to create value for discovers customers team members and shareholders we finished on very solid footing generating outstanding returns by combining solid loan growth and effective credit risk management ill now ask john to discuss our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good afternoon everyone ill begin by addressing our summary financial result on slide looking at key elements of the income statement revenue net of interest expense increased this quarter driven primarily by a increase in average loans provisions for loan losses increased mainly driven by loan growth and to a lesser extent by ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry operating expenses were up due to higher compensation expense and continued investments to support growth in collections digital platforms and advanced analytics discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 moving to slide roger already covered the key loan metrics but i wanted to emphasize that the majority of the growth in card receivables came from standardized merchandise balances with a smaller contribution from promotional balances we expect merchandise balances will continue to be a primary driver of card growth in just under of the increase in receivables was from new accounts for the remainder from existing cardholders looking at student loans total receivables were up from the prior year with the organic student loan portfolio increasing yearoveryear turning to slide volume on the discover network rose from the prior year in line with growth in the discover card spending within our payment services segment pulse volume increased over the prior year driven by strong performance in key products moving to slide net interest income of billion increased million or from the prior year the increase was driven by higher loan balances a higher revolve rate lower promotional balances and a favorable funding mix as we continue to grow lower cost directtoconsumer deposits this was partially offset by the impact of a lower average prime rate in the quarter and unfavorable funding rate reflecting maturities of lower coupon brokered and directtoconsumer deposits and higher interest chargeoffs total noninterest income was million for the quarter up million or yearoveryear the primary drivers of the increase were higher loan fees and an increase in transaction processing revenue net discount and interchange revenue was up million or turning to slide our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter consistent with our expectations this was down basis points yearoveryear and basis points sequentially relative to the prior year quarter or the decrease in nim was due principally to three factors first the unfavorable funding rate i just mentioned second the impact of a lower prime rate and third higher interest chargeoffs these were partially offset by a higher revolve rate bt fees and a favorable promotional balance mix relative to the third quarter nim decreased basis points due to the impact of lower prime rate and an unfavorable funding rate partially offset by a higher revolve rate and bt fees total loan yield decreased basis points from a year ago to primarily driven by a 12basis point decrease in card yield reflecting prime rate decreases and higher interest chargeoffs this was partially offset by a higher revolve rate bt fees and lower promotional balances on the liability side of the balance sheet average consumer deposits grew billion in the quarter and now make up of total funding consumer deposit rates decreased basis points from the third quarter as we actively manage our funding cost lower although market observers expect a stable fed funds rate this year well remain vigilant for opportunities to prudently manage our deposit and other funding cost turning to slide operating expenses increased million or from the prior year employee compensation was million higher reflecting staff increases in technology as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs professional fees were million higher mainly driven by thirdparty recovery fees cost to support investments in analytics also contributed to higher professional fees the million increase in information processing was driven by our continued investment in advanced analytics and infrastructure costs turning to credit on slide the takeaway here is that overall credit performance remains stable and well within our risk and return expectations total net chargeoffs increased basis points from the prior year with the primary driver continuing to be the seasoning of loan growth and to a lesser extent the supply driven normalization in consumer credit discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 credit card net chargeoffs increased basis points from the prior year and basis points from the prior quarter the credit card 30plus delinquency rate was basis points higher yearoveryear and basis points sequentially this was another solid credit performance in our card business reflecting our disciplined underwriting and line management we saw a modest uptick in student loan chargeoffs as the portfolio seasoned student loan credit performance continues to be aided by efficiency gains in collection including expanded outreach to cosigners in personal loans chargeoffs rose in the quarter consistent with typical seasonal patterns the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points from the prior year and basis points compared to the third quarter we continue to see credit improvement as a result of our prior credit tightening and improved fraud detection before leaving the subject of credit i wanted to preview an additional disclosure on troubled debt restructuring youll see in our 10k to provide greater clarity on the growth in our tdr receivables we will now report the balance of receivables that have successfully completed programs at december we had total credit card tdrs of billion up billion from the prior year but in fact over half of the billion increase was from customers who had successfully completed a program in account number terms this equates to about an success rate this demonstrates that our modification programs are an important aspect of helping customers through temporary hardship and also benefit discover by reducing overall credit cost and enhancing revenue lets turn now to slide our common equity tier ratio decreased basis points sequentially reflecting loan growth and capital returns partially offset by strong earnings our payout ratio which includes buybacks was over the last months and as we noted earlier average consumer deposits now make up of total funding slide provides a summary of business performance compared to our guidance for the year and against performance you will see green check marks against each of the metrics and i want to congratulate the team for its solid execution against all of our key financial objectives for the following slide provides a summary of our outlook and guidance for first we share the consensus view that the macroeconomic environment will remain stable we do not see any indicators that point to a recession in the next months we expect the us consumer to remain healthy and unemployment remaining near the current levels we also note that household debt service levels are at a 40year low an indication that consumers remain financially resilient based on these factors we have assumed no fed rate changes in our business plan this backdrop sets us up for another year of profitable growth and strong returns now turning to the specific guidance elements first we expect loan growth to be in the range of to next we expect operating expenses to be in the range of billion to billion as we continue to invest for future growth with incremental spending on our brand to increase awareness and consideration we expect net chargeoffs to be in the range of to this year reflecting a stable credit environment and the seasoning of our growing portfolio our target cet1 ratio continues to be which remains an achievable target under cecl due to the phasein for regulatory capital purposes and our capitalgenerative business model im sure youve noted our list of guidance elements for is a bit shorter in fact weve taken a fresh look and decided to no longer provide specific guidance on rewards rate or nim the rewards rate can vary quarterto discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 quarter depending on the category the annual rate has been increasing by around to basis points due to the ongoing shift from the more card to the it card and we expect this trend to continue in terms of nim the single largest driver of changes in net interest margin has been fed actions given this weve elected not to provide specific guidance but will comment on the other drivers such as deposit beta and spending patterns as part of our quarterly earnings calls so with that ill move on to the topic of cecl on the last earnings call i indicated the day one adjustment would be towards the north end of the to range we had guided to we now expect our adjustment to be approximately billion or above the year end incurred basis in terms of the day two impact the reserve change will depend upon the mix of the business economic outlook overall credit performance at the point in time in which quarterly estimates are determined additionally the seasonality of our business will impact quarterly reserve changes and could introduce some volatility from one quarter to the next as youve seen our business model is capable of generating high returns which should enable us to largely offset the capital implications of cecl over time wrapping up on slide in we generated total loan growth and delivered a robust return on equity we had a very strong year in our deposits business with growth of credit remained in line with our expectation and return targets and we executed on our capital plan by allocating capital to loan growth and share buybacks in conclusion was a strong year and were very pleased with our performance and positioning for that concludes our formal remarks so ill turn the call back to our operator erica to open up the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services hey ryan john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good evening ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey john and roger so john thanks for the updated day one outlook on cecl where you said increase i guess first what is driving that higher from the initial guidance and then second on last quarters call you mentioned the day two impact on the reserve build could be higher than day one since youre adding new accounts that dont have any incurred loss the message is slightly different from what weve heard from others so i just wanted to get a sense one how should we think about does the fact that youre growing faster and adding more accounts factor into that faster day two impact or is there something else thats impacting it thanks and i have a followup john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay thank you ryan thanks for the question so let me start with day one impact so i think as i said on the last call that my take was the team did a fantastic job in terms of modeling and preparing for cecl implementation and that view still holds very very strongly the initial guidance to included a number of factors and as we came through the fourth quarter we took a look at the modeling the performance of the portfolio and specifically recovery assumptions and we ended up revising a recovery assumption that had to do with overall recoveries taking a look at most recent history which was certainly a stellar performance and we moved it back to the middle point of the observable history on recovery so that was the primary driver of the change in day one in terms of day two i said on my first call third quarter that day two would be higher and certainly in the third quarter it was higher as we modeled and that increase had to do with the amount of volume we put on the books related to our student loan products which in terms of day two impact has a significantly higher impact than day one would under a incurred basis discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 now that actually points to some of the volatility that were seeing in cecl so as we take a look at all our product and the relative mix throughout the year i would say a good proxy for day two would be that range around so its a slight nuance on the initial message that i provided but i would also caution that thats a preliminary number and were working through it and theres a bunch of dynamics that impact cecl including the macroeconomic outlook portfolio performance mix of products that were putting on the book in any one quarter and obviously the delinquency and roll rates that were observing so a lot to consider there but i hope ive provided enough specificity to be helpful as you think about how to model this business ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for all the color and then i guess a followup for the both of you so if i look at the expense guide it implies about to expense growth which is ahead of i guess expectations and where you are running so first john can you maybe size on what are some of the incremental investments and roger are there any oneoff investments in here that you feel you need to make for this year or are we entering into a new phase of elevated investing and then second how should we think about seeing the paybacks from these investments thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay hey ryan ill start and then roger im sure will have a followup so im going to start by editorializing a little bit here so if you look at the efficiency ratio that this company has generated over time its among the lowest in the industry and then if you also look at in terms of return on equity we are among the highest in the industry and one could use those two data points and make a simple argument that perhaps weve underinvested over time given the returns that were generating so as we put the plan together for we looked at where it was appropriate to invest where we thought wed generate the best longterm return to our shareholders and there was two items specifically so investment in brand around awareness and consideration and thats a meaningful number be around million believe it or not and then also continued investment in our infrastructure to add functionality and ensure its appropriate from a scale and resiliency standpoint going forward roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and maybe just to build on what john said in terms of the payback some will be more immediate to drive our continued strong loan growth but others we also expect multiyear returns and as you think more broadly about our expenses id say its sort of a dual story of efficiency but then also investments and so the vast majority of the expense lines are close to flat yearoveryear as john and i look across the pl were looking for efficiencies in terms of our marketing expenses so our cpas that were targeting across the different products but we are investing significantly around building the brand and also building brand awareness of some of our noncard products as well as some investments in technology that we think will be very helpful in driving growth in the future john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 yeah and then just one followup comment so this company has a rich tradition of effectively managing cost and certainly my background ive had my share of cost management and analytics to ensure we are were going to get a payback on these investments so as roger said some of these are longer term some of these are shorter term well continue to monitor and ensure that for every dollar were spending were getting appropriate paybacks for our shareholders ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks appreciate the color operator well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i guess i wanted to dig in again on day two impact related to cecl i was wondering john if you could give us a little bit more to help us sort of triangulate on how we should think about the provision for john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so i guided around that figure as a call it a post or an anchor as you think about day two its still early as i mentioned on my last comment sanjay so i would say for the year thats a decent way to think about it might be a little higher might be a little lower and in terms of quarteroverquarter the third quarter we originate a lot of a lot of student loans and that day two will certainly exceed the number that i just mentioned so mix will be an important factor on it but beyond that i dont know if id be doing anyone a service by being more specific sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay fair enough and then on the other guidance data point around loan growth and not getting a whole lot on nim and rewards rate i was wondering if we think about loan growth and what revenue growth might do in relation to loan growth is it fair to assume that it should be fairly commensurate ie theres not significant factors that would lead to a different direction than one would suggest or am i thinking about it incorrectly john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services no i think youre definitely in the right direction so theres a couple of things that i just want to point out so as i said in my prepared remarks we assume no fed rate changes in our planning assumptions so if that changes that certainly as it has done historically and been a problem from a forecasting standpoint that would impact nim were also i alluded to this in the prepared remarks in terms of our focus around deposits and increasing the level of overall funding from a directtoconsumer deposits which are cheaper funding source i also mentioned that i think theres over time we will continue to work to see what we can do in terms of the cost of deposits making sure that were originating the deposits at an appropriate level to fund the balance sheet towards our longer term target but also being very mindful of the cost of funding discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 so if things went well there could be a basis point or two on the deposit side thats your call whether you want to put that into your model and then in terms of pricing action the companys been pretty stable but well continue to look for opportunities on the pricing side sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator well take our next question from john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore isi good afternoon roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi i just have a question on the tdrs i know youll be giving us more disclosure in the 10k but i want to see if you can give us the of the million loan loss reserve build that you recorded for the quarter how much of that was related to tdrs and then separately do you have what the delinquency ratio was for the tdrs for the quarter john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so for the quarter weve previously said this and it remains consistent that from a tdr standpoint only are more than days delinquent so thats remained consistent so performance there no major change in terms of reserve provisioning were probably not going to break that down on this call i dont know that it would be super helpful and if i did it would take the balance of the call to kind of walk through the nuances of it so well pass on that one if you dont mind sorry i cant be more specific john john pancari q analyst evercore isi no no i get it thats fine i guess one more on the tdr topic just given the increase that you cited the up billion yearoveryear thats about just under a increase and then tdrs were up linked quarter it looks like i mean what are you seeing differently in your the makeup of your card base that you that discover is seeing a much larger increase in the usage of tdrs versus a lot of your peer institutions i know you cant really talk too much about what the peers are seeing but the increase in tdrs has certainly outpaced that of other lenders in the space john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 yeah so let me startoff by saying that we have some really solid analytics around our tdrs and we test populations and then once those tests come back and show that indeed cash flows are improving well open it up to a certain population and then well observe that and then well adjust accordingly based on any differences we see between the test population and when the tdrspecific program is in process so im not really going to talk about what other folks are doing there also is an approach that we take where we think that and weve seen real differences in terms of outcomes for our customer base in terms of helping them work through some difficulty and they end up some of them end up sticking with us have their credit lines open back up and continue to be very very satisfied customers so what around the edges were going to take a look at smaller accounts and see if the effort to make a tdr is worthwhile based on our belief in terms of whats going to happen in those particular populations but these are good programs the financial impact is taken as soon as we tdr they remain in the delinquency buckets that theyre in unless theyve made three successive payments so what youre seeing flow through the financials is exactly what you would hope in terms of overall good credit performance and a solid book and tdrs has an approach to work with customers and help cash flows roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services and maybe just to build on that there has been a lot of noise around this and so thats part of why we decided to add the disclosures to help provide you more information and kind of give us more insight to the way we see it a better way to classify it might be not just tdrs but customers who have ever been in a tdr and so the growth really some of them will have returned to prime well be getting line increases et cetera and are well into the book it just happens to be the way we account for these is once a tdr always a tdr so thats why we think these new disclosures that you see in the 10k will be very helpful john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thank you operator well take our next question from mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thank you my question is what are the implications of the cet1 target for the end of which i believe is kind of where you guys have indicated you think you should operate longerterm on the payout ratio as we look beyond and sort of factor in the continued phasein of the cecl impacts along with continued loan growth john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah okay so ill take this and maybe roger will have a comment if appropriate so when the team set up the original target for cet1 they did that with the idea that indeed cecl would be implemented and would impact the overall capital plan for the year through the first half of so we are going through our beginning our ccar work and were going to make the submission and well get some feedback likely in june and well use that coupled with our overall plan around capital allocation that well review discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 with the board to make a determination of what the future dividend payout ratio and buyback programs will look like i would say this so as we look at cecl for and our capitalgenerative business models we can likely absorb over the shortterm based in the phasein and longterm the impact to cecl now theres questions regarding our regulators and how cecl will impact the consumer finance industry especially given its procyclical nature and the fact that products with longer lives such as student loans and certain home equity products and even to a lesser extent personal loans in a tough economic environment certain lenders might not look like the profile of that and that will impact the availability of credit i will say this we like our products under cecl and under the current fas5 methodology so its based on the cash flows cecls not impacting the cash flows and we like the return profiles that weve generated historically and will in the future roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and to build on that from our discussions with regulators i wouldnt interpret the phasein as just delaying the pain the fed has indicated to us that its designed to give them time to see how cecl is impacting different financial institutions and that actually they feel like the amount of loss absorption in the system currently ie pre cecl which is capital plus provision is appropriate so well see how that comes out but again i wouldnt just necessarily view it as something thats going to phasein and thats that mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay so sorry roger does that imply that theres some room for the fed to potentially say now that youve got greater loss absorption capacity kind of postcecl that maybe the isnt the right level that maybe you could go a little bit lower roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i would not predict what the fed is going to do i can just say what ive heard directly from them which is they feel like prececl the loss absorption is right for the system as a whole and that the phasein is not just to spread it out over time but to actually give them time to figure out what they want to do so i would say were all going to have to stay tuned john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 and then the other kind of party that will help form this will be the rating agencies right and we spent some time with the rating agencies in december and the view there is at least my personal takeaway is that theyre going to take a look at equity and reserves as in the aggregate so i dont see any major implications at least in the shortterm there mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay thank you operator well take our next question from eric wasserstrom with ubs eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc thanks very much gentlemen i have a question just about credit i heard your commentary about broadbased stability but also were seeing a few other trends too such as higher interest chargeoffs and investment in collections higher late fees the tdr experience that you cited the success rate seems high but as others have pointed out just the growth in tdrs is also very large so im just trying to put all of those pieces together to understand kind of how to really think about the credit experience over the nearterm horizon roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i would worry about stringing a bunch of things together i think weve talked about the tdrs and are adding more disclosures so that hopefully that will help you see them the way we do in terms of investing in collections i think thats something that makes a ton of sense just about anytime but certainly late cycle but thats something weve talked about i think pretty consistently for multiple years there so if youre trying to string those kind of data points into a bigger story im not sure thats something i would agree with eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay and maybe just transitioning topics for a moment in terms of the investment expense that youve highlighted is this an expense that youre thinking about over a specific horizon or should we just think about the overall efficiency ratio of discover as just being a little bit different going forward than maybe what the recent historical experience has been roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i think we provided guidance for what to expect for my guess is going beyond that well continue to invest in growth but im also optimistic about our ability to find efficiencies as well especially leveraging some of those investments on the technology side around robotic process automation around advanced analytics so were not prepared to really give guidance beyond but you can rest assured well be looking to see what we can find on the efficiency side to help fund investments in growth eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks very much discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 operator well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great sort of following up and i appreciate roger that youre not interested in giving guidance beyond that but if you put together the comment that you do expect a payback from those investments and obviously the efficiency ratio given that youre likely to see revenue growth between and at most there is going to deteriorate in i mean should we take from that the inference that at some point it should be improving or i mean can you kind of discuss that a little bit roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services actually it sounds like youre asking for longterm guidance no again as i said earlier were not giving guidance beyond next year but i did want to make it clear that you shouldnt necessarily take that as a run rate number and we do believe to the point john made as efficient as our model is compared to the rest of the financial services industry we believe there are further efficiencies to be gained by deploying some of these advances in technology so were not also saying that you can just continue to print the number for moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right maybe just to take that idea because im not a huge fan of the idea that well because its lower than others we should want it necessarily to be higher for some period of time i mean you talked about the high level of returns but its not like were seeing a degradation in that right its not like that was running down so maybe talk a little bit about what are the things you saw that kind of made this the right time to take that stand on expenses roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah no i think its a very good point moshe we dont manage the business to an efficiency ratio we manage our expenses to be as efficient as possible but then also look to invest and drive growth and the sum of those two really is the entire expense base and drives the calculation of the efficiency ratio but to the extent we see opportunities to make investments to drive accelerated growth and we feel good about the payback as john talked about we will do that and communicate that as appropriate but i think your points a good one you dont want necessarily just manage the business to an efficiency ratio moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc no i dont think so and i guess i look forward to having a future discussion about seeing some of those gains coming in there on the revenue side roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure operator well take our next question from jason kupferberg with bank of america discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi this is mihir for jason maybe we could start with just cecl i just want to make sure we understand i think you had mentioned like cecl has a differential impact on some of your products particularly on day two and as we go into the quarters has that changed the way you think about those products and also just relatedly in terms of just the disclosures youll be providing are you going to provide disclosures for the next several quarters so we can compare results on a more applestoapples basis john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so yes thanks for the question so in terms of how we think about our products we think about them from a cash flow standpoint and on a risk and return basis and we continue to like all our products whether we are on an incurred basis or under this new regime cecl so no change in the thinking there now in terms of disclosure what weve said previously and we continue to be in the same spot that we will provide disclosures that will create transparency between cecl incurred for the next four quarters mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it now that makes sense thank you and then just real quick if i can go back to just the opex guide maybe i guess clearly its a topic integer on this call but maybe if you could give us a little bit of more color on just the kinds of investments youre making and just maybe just help us understand your loan growth next year is to is a little i guess in the range similar to this year and it sounds like some of these investments have a little bit longer payback period but is it also supporting that to loan growth this year and do you need to make those investments to achieve that growth i guess that would help thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so heres how we think about it so there is the investment in brand to drive awareness and consideration we havent actually baked it in but we think that over time will lower our acquisition cost our per unit acquisition costs as people find greater awareness of discover the product offerings the customer experience and frankly a fair value exchange so that is one aspect but that is over time and to be determined the other piece around technology investments were going to be very judicious about those and with those to make sure that we are deploying functionality that helped make a difference to either our growth trajectory or expense profile so over time i would expect that indeed well see efficiency gains either top line or through the expense base and some of them as roger said longer term some are shorter term but there is a thorough process to make sure were getting the bang for the buck mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you operator well take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question when we think about the sort of normal factors that cause hardship loss of job death unemployment or illness and divorce is there anything that idiosyncratic that youre seeing thats changing in the portfolio or is there a policy shift thats driving this roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah no there is no change in terms of i would say customer behavior what youre seeing here is frankly the benefit of frankly some solid analytics by our collections team in terms of when a customer is experiencing difficulty in helping that customer manage through it the only process change weve made is that used to be someone had to callin and talk to a rep for large balances that continues to be the case for certain customers who made a certain criteria they can do it online on their mobile app and weve tested those populations versus the callin populations and actually the mobile app populations are performing as well or better than when someone talks to a rep so what youre really seeing here in the growth is a couple of factors one is the i think there is a difference in reporting versus some competitors two is weve had weve done an analytical exercise to make sure we understand payback and we are to make a difference to cash flows positively and weve open those up so its a combination of those factors and were going to keep doing them as long as theyre cash flow positive richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and to the extent it is constructed from an npv perspective does the transition to cecl and for lifetime reserve make it easier because theres less accounting sort of penalty to doing this roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah you know what in terms of the pl impact right when you take a tdr you basically take the net present value of the cash flows and compare it to your balance and thats the pl impact cecl you basically do the same thing on life of loan losses so yeah the relative kind of decrement to the pl if you were growing tdrs is smaller under cecl but thats not how we make decisions here richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you so much operator well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi john a couple of followups on the day two conceptual accounting can you clarify what you mean by the not on the day one but on day two are you talking about incremental provision discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc on just the loan growth and then also can you talk once your allowance rate sort of is set will it remain relatively stable through the year if theres no change in sort of mix or economic outlook john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so in terms of the on day two it would be relative to what they would be on an incurred basis so an incremental versus incurred now loan growth will create incrementality versus an incurred basis its just the nature of taking a lifetime loss upfront in a provisioning standpoint and donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc right john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services we the team did a really good job in terms of modeling and we feel like were appropriately reserved and from a day one standpoint and going forward if were seeing better recoveries through a cycle or better performance from a overall portfolio standpoint then well adjust and if correspondingly if were challenged somewhere well adjust the other way donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc but conceptually what do you think about sort of the reasons all else equal that the allowance rate would remain relatively stable throughout the year despite mix or economic change and are we talking about sort of cecl being an incremental couple percent gaap eps impact all else equal john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so im not sure im totally clear on the question but ill try to answer and if i miss we can come back so in terms of if were seeing a change in the economy or our outlook of the economy or a change in the performance of our portfolio or a change in mix all those will have an impact on the cecl reserves so donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc no i understand that but im saying if those were not to change will the allowance rate all else equal kind of stay the same throughout the year john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 yeah yeah so it would build for loan growth at that rate but in terms of kind of relative difference to incurred it would be fairly consistent donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc appreciate it operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening a couple of questions roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good evening betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey so roger i just wanted to swing back to the investment spend i think during the some of the comments you were mentioning that with the investment spend youre expecting to be able to enhance the brand awareness maybe use the words in particular or especially in noncard product im wondering if you are messaging to us that you think that youre under represented in either of the personal loans or in the student loans or if theres other products that youre looking to get into maybe you could touch base on what the implications for that is and if the payback for the investment should come in the form more in loan growth and nii or should it be more should there be any fees associated with it as well just like to understand how youre thinking about that roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services okay so the investment in brand there are two parts right part of it is just increasing consideration on the card side youve seen some work around building awareness that we offer products other than just cash back so we put add money behind miles as well but we do as we look at consumers out there there is a gap in terms of what ill call top of funnel right people who consider discover and have us top of mind so thats why as we think about our marketing mix were going to heavyup a bit on topoffunnel brand type advertising there also is an opportunity for our noncard products in particular some of the deposit products weve made great strides in terms of the products themselves went out with sort of no fees across any of our deposit products but there still are huge amounts of consumers that dont understand for example where even in the discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 student loan business let alone we are the second largest originator of private student loans and the same holds true with understand that discover offers a savings account or checking account so its a mix of both of those building and enhancing consideration on the card side and building awareness for our noncard products betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then this investment spend should kick off in like should i take this million and just divide by four and throw that through the model linearly or is this going to be backend loaded kind of in a environment how should i think about the pace of that spend throughout the year roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services we tend not to comment on the seasonality of the spend sorry betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay operator well take our next question from bill carcache with nomura william carcache q analyst nomura instinet thank you good evening roger and john i had a highlevel question on the guidance for you i think everyone would agree with your earlier point that you guys have a rich history of generating high returns and industry leading operating efficiency but within that theres also been a commitment to positive operating leverage that were not seeing in this years guidance with your revenue growth and expense guidance suggesting that youre explicitly guiding to negative operating leverage and so when we think about whats changed it seems like in the past what weve seen from discover is a commitment to managing expenses for the revenue environment and achieving positive operating leverage by finding cost improvement opportunities in one area to the extent that you need to make investments in another as opposed to the approach that you guys seem to be taking now which is more along the lines of making the investments upfront with the expectation that youll get the efficiency improvements later so is that an accurate way to think about i was just hoping you could comment on that and just share any high level thoughts and thats my only question thanks roger c hochschild q president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so first id say its by and large john is new but youve got the same team thats been here for decades making the investment decisions and i think youve seen a lot of discipline from us over the years whether its on the credit side or the expense side it isnt necessarily a tradeoff where we sort of managed to an expense budget and then sort of if we can generate more efficiencies then that frees up more money for growth we try and be disciplined and consistent discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 so our investments in growth theyre really more driven by the opportunities we see to put our shareholders money to work to drive good organic growth with strong return profiles for that and i mentioned that we expect our unit costs on the investments in account acquisition to be coming down next year but we do feel like theres an opportunity to put some money to work with a bit of a longer payback on the brand side in particular sort of topoffunnel brand advertising driving that awareness and consideration and on technology that reflects some specific decisions we are making for i would not read into any change in discipline or philosophy from the team here at discover william carcache q analyst nomura instinet understood thanks for taking my question operator well take our next question from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good evening i guess trying to followup on just on the revenue growth the loan growth and revenue growth is there the potential through some of the deposit products or the consumer banking products the growth of reva pay b2b that you could get revenue growth higher than loan growth over time is that a goal or and is there a potential to do that and it seems youve made a lot of investments in the network in b2b payments over the last several years roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah b2b payments have benefited us probably so far more in terms of volume than profitability the margins can be very thin but weve been clear that we would love to see more of our earnings come from the payment segment and are very focused on driving that that can be a multiyear initiative so i wouldnt necessarily expect something transformational in but we have a unique collection of payments assets if you look at pulse and diners club and sort of the fact that we built the third largest global network in terms of acceptance so the team is very focused on monetizing that but again youre talking about a b2b sales cycle and so that will take some time robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc okay maybe a followup on the competitive environment and with the maybe with the entrance of the apple card which mean maybe is going after the your demographic the growth of neobanks probably going after the deposit space in your target segment several of them some of those companies getting super high valuations as private companies what are your thoughts on the apple card on the neobanks and in some of your investment in brand in response to the competitive environment roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so our investments in brand are much more driven by our traditional competitors and as weve seen those super high private company valuations appear to come and go as i think about competition competition in the card space is always intense right it tends to be rational but you have some large sophisticated players its a discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 high return business its challenging but always intensely competitive so i would view the apple card as you cant underestimate anything that apple does its a new competitor and one that im sure will be formidable but i dont think its transforming the overall competitive environment in the card space on the deposit side its a different decision in terms of who you take a loan from from who you give your money and so brand and trust remain key elements of that i think as you saw from the very strong directtoconsumer deposit growth we posted we feel like we have the product set and the ability to compete we really just need to build awareness and a lot of the focus is on moving deposits from some of the traditional branchbased players as opposed to necessarily going head to head with some of these emerging online players robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc okay thank you operator well take our next question from john hecht with jeffery sic jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah hi thanks very much for taking my questions actually most of my questions have been asked but a couple ph of those are out there number one is you mentioned some unfavorable funding triggers in the quarter and im wondering are you able to unwind those are those kind of permanent aspects of the funding going forward john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so actually what that was is if you go back about a yearandahalf ago we had some really cheap cds on the books and then there was fed rate actions and more expensive deposits came on the books and over time if theres no fed action youll see favorability come through into the pl on that and if you look at the john hecht q analyst jefferies llc and what duration should we expect that in where youll get that favorable outcome on the deposit costs john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so its throughout this year and into next year john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay and then followup question would be youve taken deposit as a percentage of funding up a couple hundred basis points in the period how should we think about funding mix over the course of john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 yeah so we enjoyed great growth there that i think its a testament to both the team and the products and discover in general we have a longer term target of directtoconsumer deposits thereabouts and i would say next three to five years on that so one way to do it would be to draw a line and plot it accordingly john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thats very helpful thank you guys very much take operator well take our next question from david scharf with jmp david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc hi good afternoon and once again pretty much all my questions have been answered except i did want to just followup on what i hope is not a repetitive topic on the investment spend it seemed like collections was highlighted a couple times i think backward looking in the fourth quarter i have written down that you had more thirdparty professional fees and then going forward it was more of a broader investment late cycle just curious i mean should we be thinking about sort of undercapacity with inhouse collectors is that why you defaulted to more third parties or are you finding any challenges with recovery rates internally can you give us a little color besides just the cyclical factors roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so just to be clear in terms of collections which we define as sort of prior chargeoff we do of that in house and so thats with our own usbased employee it is very scalable a lot of our investments have been in the area of analytics as well as if you think about collections is marketing weve seen great impact from sort of building out digital collections there are lot of people who may not want to talk about the situation theyre in but like seeing the options they have online and so i think collections is an area where you can achieve competitive advantage so its there hasnt been a change in our investment strategy there its been a multiyear journey and we expect to continue on the recovery side we do work with third parties and so to the extent recoveries are more successful because of the commission structures we will pay more in recovery fees but that usually means theres a net benefit john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services right and just adding onto that so the recoveries are up yearoveryear about so what youre seeing is thats i think a factor of portfolio but probably more reflective of where we are in the economic cycle and the fact that the consumer strength is probably quite frankly increasing and as wealth distribution is also improving mildly so not a bad story there on the professional fees whatsoever roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services and theres one discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc got it roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thing id point out on the recovery side we do not sell any of our chargeoff paper and havent for well over years so you do enjoy a stream from those recoveries as opposed to people who would just sell and take the npv david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc right and just as a quick followup and i assume embedded in your net chargeoff range you provided for is a consistent recovery rate as a percentage of gross chargeoff rate or is there any modification or conservatism built in there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so overall chargeoffs i mean we gave the range thats a net range and i think were pretty comfortable with that as guidance david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc great thank you operator well take our next question from meng jiao with deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good afternoon guys most my questions have been answered already i just had to one quick question i guess on the deposits it looks like i guess the broker deposits were pretty down this year is that the i guess the run rate going forward is we should see more i guess runoff in the broker deposits range as well as continue expansion in direct to consumer john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah in general thats the plan were going to keep that open as a channel but in terms of our funding stack that should continue to decrease as an overall percentage of the funding stack as the dtc increases meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got you okay and then i guess the second question is in terms of ma i know you guys are focused on b2b partnerships and noting that less interest in a bank deal has that changed materially in prior quarters or is that still the same message going forward discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think we feel good about the businesses were in and our ability to that grow organically and i think if you look on the banking side i dont see any gaps in our model that we would need to fill meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thank you operator well take our next question from bill ryan with compass point william ryan q analyst compass point research trading llc thanks for taking my question a question on student lending if you could maybe give us some idea of what your origination volume was in versus  andor percent and maybe what your outlook is for and maybe a little bit of color what you seeing in terms of pricing your market share and borrower profile thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so in terms of growth we said organically we had organic growth in student loans not on originations but loan balance and we provided overall guidance on loan growth which is inclusive of student loans so were not going to get into kind of origination levels we just dont think thats probably the most helpful information william ryan q analyst compass point research trading llc okay any color on pricing or where you think your market share is and things like that roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think we feel good about the season of originations weve had so again a little harder to get market share data but we certainly feel like we held our position as the second largest originator even in an environment where there were some new entrants and in terms of kind of who we target in credit we remain very disciplined william ryan q analyst compass point research trading llc thank you operator well take our next question from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hi thanks so much for taking my question when you talk about the investment spend how much of the investment spend are there plans to use this period of time to significantly invest in the global network in particular and how much is the focus there given what youve talked about on investment spend thanks discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think we highlighted the two areas where we want to call out a significant increase one was around the brand and advertising the other one was on technology we did not highlight a significant change in spending and again as we look at building our global acceptance some of it is working with acquirers some of those is very cost effective we built through these networktonetwork agreements and thatll remain a core part of the strategy dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay great thanks so much operator and there are no further questions at this time mr streem your closing remarks please craig a streem investor relations discover financial services thanks erica thank you everybody for your attention and for staying with us through this long call but we wanted to make sure that we took care of everybodys
