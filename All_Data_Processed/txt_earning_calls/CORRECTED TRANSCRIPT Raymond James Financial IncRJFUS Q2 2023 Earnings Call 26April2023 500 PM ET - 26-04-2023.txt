conference its great to see such an upbeat mood and people really having a good time getting back together as well as all the other educational sessions we have here since our founding over years ago raymond james has maintained an unwavering commitment to placing clients first through conservative decisionmaking that keeps us wellpositioned over the long term while remaining focused on the long term has not always been easy or fully appreciated in good times it has served us very well over time and its times such as these when even the financial system itself is challenged that our philosophy not only carries us through but enables us to thrive just a few examples of our differentiated positioning that weve benefit recently from includes tier leverage capital ratio of over times the regulatory requirement to be wellcapitalized of our bank deposits are fdicinsured including nearly of raymond james bank amongst the highest in the entire industry and a level rating with all three credit agencies which fitch reaffirmed in march at the height of the turmoil a few weeks later we were able to renew and upsize our fiveyear committed revolver with enhanced terms thanks to the fantastic relationship we have with all of our bank partners further we were able to buy back million of shares at what we believe were attractive prices and we still have billion of capacity remaining under our board authorization in times like these we are reminded of the importance of keeping a longterm clientfocused approach and our stakeholders benefit and appreciate the firms dedication to placing them first now turning to our results despite the challenging market and the high market volatility during the first six months of the fiscal year we generated record net revenues and record earnings reviewing second quarter results starting on slide the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of billion and net income available to common shareholders of million or per diluted share excluding expenses related to acquisitions adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share the increase in interestrelated revenues driven by shortterm interest rates drove significant earnings growth over the prior year net revenues increased and net income available to common shareholders grew and despite the challenging market conditions and our robust capital position we generated strong returns with annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 moving to slide we ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of trillion pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion with our continuing focus on retaining supporting and attracting high quality financial advisors pcg consistently generates strong organic growth which is evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of billion representing an annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic pcg assets during the prior months we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing production and nearly billion of client assets at their previous firms total clients domestic sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion down from december of the sequential decline reflects the expected cash sorting activity which was partially offset by the launch of our enhanced savings program we are pleased with the early success of our enhanced savings program this product offered to pcg clients the raymond james bank is a fantastic option for clients seeking competitive rates while maintaining a high level of fdic insurance we believe this product is really unique in the industry and certainly appealing in the current environment as of this week enhanced savings program balances have surpassed billion total bank loans decreased from the preceding quarter to billion primarily reflecting a modest decline in securitiesbased loans due to higher interest rate environment we will touch on this more later on the call but we plan to remain very prudent with growing our corporate loans over the next several months given volatile market conditions moving to slide private client group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million yearoveryear assetbased revenues declined due to market declines however pcgs results were listed by the benefit of higher interest rates and interestrelated revenues and fees as paul shoukry will explain in more detail this quarter was negatively impacted by some seasonal expenses as well as elevated legal costs the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax loss of million revenues declined compared to the prioryear quarter mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues the extremely challenging market environment particularly for investment banking has strained the nearterm profitability of the segment however we are focused on managing controllable expenses as nearterm revenues are depressed the asset management segment generated pretax income of million on net revenues of million the yearoveryear decreases in net revenue and pretax income were largely attributable to lower assets and fee based accounts as net inflows into feebased accounts and to the private client group are offset by market declines solid net inflows for raymond james investment management helped boost financial assets under management which should provide a tailwind in the fiscal third quarter the bank segment generated record net revenues of million and pretax income of million revenue growth was largely due to the continued expansion of the banks net interest margin to for the quarter up basis points over the yearago quarter and basis points from the preceding quarter the nim expansion reflected the flexible and floating nature of our balance sheet although as paul shoukry will explain we do expect some headwinds to nim which reached very high levels across the industry over the past couple of months looking at the fiscal yeartodate results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion and record net income available to common shareholders of million up and respectively over the prior years raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 record additionally we generated strong annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the sixmonth period on slide the strength of the pcg and bank segment for the first half of the year primarily reflects the strong organic growth in pcg and the benefit of higher interest related revenues whereas the weaker capital markets results reflected the challenging environment for investment banking and brokerage revenues especially when compared to the record activity levels in the year ago period and now im going to turn the call over to paul shoukry for a more detailed review of the second quarter financials paul paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting on slide consolidated net revenues were a record billion in the second quarter up over the prior year and sequentially being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diversified and complementary businesses asset management and related administrative fees declined compared to the prioryear quarter and increased sequentially due to the higher assets and feebased accounts at the end of the preceding quarter partially offset by fewer billable days in the fiscal second quarter this quarter feebased assets grew providing a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal third quarter brokers revenues of million declined yearoveryear and grew sequentially this yearoveryear decline was largely due to lower assetbased trail revenues in pcg as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the capital markets segment ill discuss account service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million declined yearoveryear and grew sequentially as experienced across the industry ma revenues were particularly challenged this quarter declining yearoveryear and sequentially despite a healthy banking pipeline a solid new business activity there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timings of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility it remains too difficult to say when conditions will become conducive to increase investment banking revenues moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion down compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets the enhanced savings program added approximately billion in new deposits in march as the offering was only open to net new balances until april and a good portion of these new balances were derived from brand new clients to the firm following the silicon valley bank collapse highlighting the attractiveness of this product and raymond james being viewed as a source of strength and stability as paul said the enhanced savings program balances exceeded billion this week continuing to grow nicely and partially offsetting the anticipated decline in sweep balances largely due to the quarterly fee billings in april whilst difficult to parse through the disclosures to make sure we are comparing apples to apples of the handful of peers who have reported thus far we estimate yearoveryear cash sweep declines for those peers were approximately to this compares to a yearoveryear decline in our domestic sweep balances in raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 march so this dynamic of declining sweep balances has really been the experience of roughly the same order of magnitude for most of the firms in our industry and as most of you know we have been expecting communicating and preparing for this sorting activity for quite some time looking forward we expect additional cash sorting activity although we believe we are much closer to the end of that dynamic than we are at the beginning if rates settle out in nearterm levels as the average sweep balance per account over the approximately million accounts domestically is now less than and we hope to continue to offset any further cash sorting activities through our diversified funding sources including the enhanced savings program tristate deposit franchise and other initiatives and when the sorting dynamic does stabilize we would then expect to grow sweep balances given our strong organic rate in pcg meanwhile to be prudent we would strive to maintain a strong funding cushion of domestic cash swept to third party banks not too much lower than where it ended the march quarter we would also plan to keep elevated cash balances in the bank segment which grew from billion in december to billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter while these actions dont optimize net interest margin over the short term we believe they give us the most flexibility over the long term turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up over the prior year quarter and over the preceding quarter as the sequential decrease in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was more than offset by higher firmwide net interest income the bank segments net interest margin increased basis points sequentially to for the quarter and the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased basis points to our longstanding approach of maintaining a high concentration of floating rate assets not only helped drive more immediate upside to higher shortterm interest rates but also preserve a relatively flexible balance sheet compared to the banks that have much higher concentration of duration risk looking forward we expect combined net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks to decline sequentially in fiscal third quarter due to a decrease in thirdparty rjbdp fees given the lower average balances with thirdparty banks we would also expect the bank segments nim to contract from the second quarter given the higher level of cash balances we plan to maintain during this volatile period as well as the impact from higher cost diversified funding sources but as we have always said instead of focusing on maximizing nim we are focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income over the long term which we still believe we are wellpositioned to do after the cash sorting dynamic is behind us but near term we expect headwinds for the net interest income and rjbdp fees for the reasons i just explained moving to consolidated expenses on slide compensation expense was billion and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was the adjusted compensation ratio was during the quarter the compensation ratio continues to benefit from higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks the sequential increase in compensation reflects higher revenues as well as the impact of salary increases effective on january along with the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year we are very pleased to generate a adjusted compensation ratio given these factors and the extremely challenging market environment for capital markets noncompensation expenses of million increased sequentially adjusting for acquisitionrelated non compensation expenses and a favorable settlement received in the fiscal first quarter which are all including our raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 nongaap earning adjustments noncompensation expenses grew during the quarter this increase was largely driven by higher legal and regulatory costs including an unfavorable arbitration award totaling million along with higher communication and information processing expenses which reflect continued technology investments and the seasonal impact of yearend mailings the bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of million largely reflects the chargeoff of a ci loan thats been challenged for several quarters as well as higher allowances in the cre portfolio ill discuss more related to the credit quality in the bank segment shortly in summary we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest and grow and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients while theres been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory expenses this quarter and there are always some seasonal expenses that hit in the first calendar quarter of the year none of the noncompensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we expected when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year but legal and regulatory expenses are inherently difficult to predict slide shows a pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the current quarter we generated a pretax margin of an adjusted pretax margin of a strong result given the industrywide challenges impacting capital markets on slide at quarter end total assets were billion a sequential increase largely reflecting the billion increase of cash balances in the bank segment during the quarter liquidity and capital remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target a tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be wellcapitalized the tier leverage ratio reflects over billion of excess capital above our conservative target which would still be two times the regulatory requirement to be wellcapitalized our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth we were pleased to have our a credit rating reaffirmed by fitch in midmarch in the announcement fitch cited the firms strong capital cushion significant deposit funding and access to unsecured debt markets among other drivers as reason for the rating also in april we renewed our revolving credit facility and expanded it from million to million our strong balance sheet and longstanding relationships with our banking partners enabled us to upsize the fiveyear committed corporate revolver with enhanced terms to further strengthen our contingent liquidity sources the ability to execute this facility in a challenging market environment is a testament to our longterm conservative approach i know many of our bankers are listening on this call so id like to thank all of you for your continued support and partnership we also have other significant sources of contingent funding for example just to be proactive given the market uncertainty in march we increased our fhlb borrowings in the bank segment by only million from december to march and given our strong cash position weve already paid million of that down in april that leaves us more than billion of fhlb capacity in the bank segment slide provide a summary of capital actions over the past five quarters during the fiscal second quarter the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share as of april approximately billion were made available under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization and we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases as we discussed previously raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 particularly as this market volatility has provided attractive opportunities for us and we dont plan on using as much capital to support balance sheet growth over the next three to six months lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for the bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of our loan portfolio remains healthy criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was at quarter end we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation supply chain constraints higher interest rates and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio i know theres been a lot of attention on commercial real estate across the industry given the challenges with property value and interest rates so let me briefly cover our portfolio across the bank segment we have cre and reit loans of approximately billion which represents of our total loans our office portfolio is only of these real estate loans so our office portfolio only represents approximately of the bank segment total loans and based on the underwriting and origination along with the most recent appraisals the average loan to value of this office portfolio is somewhere around which is probably a little bit higher now given pressure on valuations in the industry but still providing us a lot of cushion on this portfolio on average overall we have deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate and we underwrote office loans with what we believe were conservative criteria but we continue to monitor each loan closely given the industrywide challenges now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul and as i said at the start of the call im pleased with our results for the first six months of fiscal and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a very volatile market and while there is still a lot of nearterm economic uncertainty we are in a position of strength and i believe we are well positioned to drive growth over the longterm across all of our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the sequential increase of assets and feebased accounts however we do expect to have some headwinds from lower rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks given lower average balances focusing more on the long term im optimistic we will continue delivering industryleading growth as current and prospective advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and our leading technology and product solutions for example in our current advisor recruiting pipeline we have several commitments from teams with million to million of annual production in the capital markets segment while ma pipelines remain healthy and engagement levels are good the pace and timing of launching and closing transactions will be challenged until market conditions stabilize and in the fixed income space depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities putting pressure on our brokerage activity however indiscernible enhances our position as this business typically benefits from elevated rate volatility and has produced excellent results since joining us raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 while we expect continued industry wide challenges over the next couple of quarters over the long term we are wellpositioned across the capital markets business for growth given the investments weve made over the past five years which has significantly increased our productive capacity and market share we will continue to prudently manage expenses in these businesses as the nearterm revenues continue to come under pressure obviously we will take more significant actions if the industry headwinds prove to be more long term in the asset management segment financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter up compared to the preceding quarter which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive throughout the fiscal third quarter we remain confident that strong growth of assets and feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management which generated solid net inflows this quarter to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution operational and marketing synergies and in the bank segment our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources while well continue to support our pcg clients when their demand for loans eventually recover we will be very prudent in growing corporate loans given market uncertainty we believe there will be a more attractive opportunities in the future if spreads widen to reflect the higher cost of funding andor higher premium required for credit risk across the entire banking industry and just as we did during uncertain market environments in the past we have been and will continue to be opportunistic in selling certain loans to further derisk the corporate portfolio especially when we believe the secondary market prices do not fully reflect the downside risks so overall our approach in the bank segment over the next three to six months is to build as much dry powder as possible for what we believe will be a more attractive and opportunistic environment for loan growth in fiscal in closing we believe we are wellpositioned with strong prospects for future growth and ample cash and liquidity on certain times like these are when clients need trusted advice the most and i want to thank our advisors and their associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day the strength and stability of our firm is a direct reflection of your commitment so thank you all for all you do and with that operator that concludes my remarks and well open up the line for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and one moment please for the first question the first question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please proceed with your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good afternoon paul and paul how are you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good devin paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc good i hopped on a minute late but yeah the question just on the net interest income outlook i just want to make sure i understood the commentary so is the expectation that its going to take a nearterm stepback and then can grow off of whatever that new base is or paul are you saying that youll kind of resume growth off of the fiscal second quarter level and i guess related i heard that youre going to operate i think with higher reserves so just how much of a drag is that and i guess what would make you comfortable bringing that down paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc ill let the other paul go through the nim but i dont think we anticipate right now higher reserves but then reserve cash maybe well be carrying a little more cash but i dont know which reserve youre referring to so devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah i was referring to the cash reserve which is the cash liquidity paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc oh yes theres more cash in the bank go ahead paul ill let paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah so we did increase the cash balances at the bank just given the volatility in march we thought it would be prudent so we finished the quarter by i think billion so we were up billion for the quarter ending the quarter at billion of cash at the bank segment and so that is a drag on nim because youre earning closer to raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 on that versus the 7orsopercent were earning on new loans that were putting on the book but we think thats prudent just given the volatility and in terms of the outlook going forward near term we do expect a pullback of net interest income and bdp fees when you look at those on a combined basis we plan on keeping the cash swept to thirdparty banks at around the card level just because we think that billion gives us a nice cushion it also offers clients maximum fdic insurance which we all know is really important for clients right now and so by doing that even at billion those fees are probably going to be down average balances will be down sequentially and so those fees will be down roughly depending on what happens with rates and other things and then the net interest income will be pressured by having higher cash balances and then higher cost of funding that we raised since launching the enhanced savings program in march so all net together i think that would result in probably somewhere around a decline sequentially and then as we start growing balances from there then that would be probably a good jumping off point devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc got it okay great color i guess maybe just i want to followup on the same topic and paul you just mentioned the enhanced savings program looks like youre having some nice success there and im assuming that its still reasonably early in terms of the advisor penetration so just love to maybe talk about kind of the expectation for growth there and maybe would could advisors be more active moving their customers cash there in the near term just given that its new and so that could pressure the i guess the rate on the liability side or do you have data thats just suggesting that the majority of the yieldseeking cash has already moved out of the accounts paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would tell you when we look at sort of the trends it looks like a lot of the sorting activity that the higher yieldseeking activity has occurred when we rolled out the enhanced savings program in march it was actually to new money to the firm until we expanded it in april to certain security sales and new money to the bank but we raised billion of brand new flows to the firm during the month of march and most of it was midmarch during the banking turmoil so we were pleased to see that those cash balances come in but even then with were close to billion today these balances that represents roughly of the sweep and enhanced yield savings balances whereas most of our peers are at of their balances being an enhanced yield savings so our relative cost of funds when you look at those two balances together is still very attractive even though weve been able to be more generous to clients on the sweep balances in terms of passing on rates via the sweeps as well so we feel like were wellpositioned and right now what were really hoping to do is a lot of clients hold money market fund positions and would prefer to have fdic insurance and so a lot of those balances now are moving to the enhanced yield savings which we think is a really a winwin for the clients and the firm devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yes got it okay all very helpful i will hop back in the queue ph with the other guys thanks so much raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 operator and the next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw please proceed with your question kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening maybe just a first question on the leverage ratio obviously sitting at just curious whether you still feel that target is a good level to think about as a nearterm target especially with the macro environment and kind of the uncertainty that were facing with the macro right now paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah thats the hard one to peg with thats like happening today in the press even were going to be more cautious until the industry is sorting down and that we see kind of a level field we think that the is a good target but in the short term were probably not going to be overaggressive to it especially if were not growing the bank aggressively we dont think thats the smart move right now we will continue to let ph spl balances and mortgage our client balances fund those those with priority were not sure its a good time to get into the increasing the corporate side of the lending right now just because of the market so shorter term i think the capital ratio is going to be over the but were not going to change the goal but during the volatility like weve seen with todays news and other things were going to be cautious till were pretty comfortable the markets settled down paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc the only thing i would add to that is a lot of other banks have to worry about the impact of unrealized losses on their securities portfolio and we have some of those as well obviously but i think we would be north of even if we factored in all of those losses because we kept duration relatively contained on our balance sheet so were in a position of strength when you look at our capital ratios and feel like we have a lot of flexibility kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then just maybe a followup question to that just with your stock price where its at today obviously in the first quarter calendar first quarter you were up the buyback a bit here but just wondering if you can kind of compare the current valuation of your stock to maybe any opportunities that youre seeing in the ma market if you kind of could expand upon some of those opportunities that youre seeing and what segments youre seeing more opportunity in light of everything thats happened in the banking space as well that would be helpful paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes weve done a really good job of staying close to the people that we would like to join the firm and those opportunities are clearly up and that includes the ma and the private client space again whether they get transactable because of price or other issues or some are more complex than others but those conversations that kind of went away some have come back but price adjustments of the buyer and the seller are always in line in expectation with the market we as weve said in here dont expect a nearterm increase in our ma volume until this market settles out i think lending has to kind of return and thats not our view not going to happen until we see interest rates settle and people get used to it so but we think there will be ma opportunity we have both the capital and liquidity to handle that our balance sheet as you know is very leveraged and we have access so were as most downturns weve been able to take advantage of the market and our presumption is raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 we would be able to but again that all depends on buyers and sellers and opportunities and other factors in the market kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much operator and the next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks guys good afternoon so can we start with the outlook for nii if i heard you correctly i think you guys are guiding to down firmwide nii can you help with some of the underlying assumptions in terms of nim firmwide and maybe how are you thinking about the ultimate amount of cash that you need to run with on the balance sheet and obviously it would be helpful to know what youre assuming for interest rates for the second quarter underpinning that decline paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah the decline alex includes the bdp fees as well so its kind of a combined basis as we show it in the presentation and that factors in the 25basis point increase that the market is expecting in may and so in terms of the cash that we plan on holding on the banks balance sheet we plan on holding more than we need for during these volatile times more than we hopefully need during these volatile times just to stay prudent and as paul said were being deliberate and growing corporate loans and were being actually opportunistic and selling corporate loans so not much balance sheet growth forecasted over the next at least during this period of volatility and in some cases for example weve already sold over million of corporate loans that we had rated lower from a credit perspective and were able to get near par value for those loans we had marks on them that were higher than what the price we were able to get so we dont believe that the markets fully factoring in potentially the downside risk on certain loans and so just as weve done in other volatile periods were sort of being opportunistic knowing that were just building dry powder both capital and hopefully funding dry powder to accelerate growth when the opportunities look more attractive alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you okay yeah combined makes a lot more sense i appreciate that my second question was around non comp expenses and i appreciate that you guys think this is close to where you were budgeting for but if we look at noncomp exprovisions and backing out of the million of the arbitration fee it looks like it was up almost million sequentially so maybe help us reconcile whats driving the growth and just given your outlook for effectively peak rates revenues in a challenging capital markets backdrop when should we expect you guys to become a little bit more aggressive on cost savings initiatives paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 yeah the first two quarters are always a little bit lumpy in terms of the noncompensation expenses so if you look at it kind of on a combined basis backing out the acquisitionrelated costs and backing out the loan loss provision which is how we made the guidance its around i think million for the first six months of the year which actually trends lower than the billion guidance i provided for the noncomp expenses excluding provision so we still were not changing that guidance for the time being because none of the other than legal and regulatory which is inherently unpredictable and we had a million arbitration award which we were not expecting obviously this quarter we are most of the other line items are kind of coming in in line with what weve forecasted when we provided that guidance but of course things change between now and the next six months of the fiscal year then we certainly will update that and let you all know paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that comparison was looks bigger because of the million last year paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc last quarter paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc last quarter recovery that we nongaap too but its we think theyre in line and yeah legal fees certainly were higher that settlement was higher but thats really driving and thats kind of lumpy we think the run rate and the guidance is still in the ballpark from what we can see paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc and with that being said while its coming in line with what we expected were also given the market environment going to be very deliberate in managing all of those expenses while still investing in growth in high service levels paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc indiscernible alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it got it thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah operator and the next question comes from the line of bill katz with credit suisse please proceed with your question raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 bill katz q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thank you very much appreciate you taking the question this evening maybe stepping back and perhaps its just too soon to tell as you think about some of the structural changes that may evolve for the banking industry on the side the other side of the banking collapse and maybe your early stage conversation with the regulators how do you see the evolution for regulatory capital or leverage ratios does that affect your bogey and then maybe how you think about longterm growth in earning assets and the nim associated with that paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well first on capital i think give it a were well set over what anyone is our competitors and other things we think thats still a very conservative target we cant see any regulations that would make anything even close to that so wed still have buffer there so were not worried about capital like everything given the environment weve been focused on liquidity thats why we rolled out the enhanced savings program and are very heartened that even after the quarter we paid our billion in asset management fees come out of there we had tax payments that usually go over billion our cash balances are still steady so on the liquidity side the question is just how much do we have to raise than the higher yielding programs but we feel good about our liquidity and not even touching our really our fhlb advances or that billion buffer so third then becomes is when you start investing in that order when you start investing in the growth in assets and in the bank and that were just going to have to decide were not going to be really aggressive where we see opportunities we could well take them if we see ma opportunities we think are good well act on them and we just dont think given the banking market rising rates and if people are predicting a recessionary environment its the time to be very aggressive in growing corporate loans so i would say were our growth plans are not really to expand the balance sheet much this next quarter paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think you asked the question about the future nim prospects for the industry and i think the banking industry is pretty efficient the good news is we already have a very conservative level of capital so i think were well as paul said wellpositioned for those changes but to the extent the capital rules do change or increase and certainly that the cost of the average deposit in the industry as all the big banks were saying even the largest banks are saying thats increasing as well then you would expect all else being equal for spreads to expand across the industry to preserve a reasonable nim and a reasonable return on equity for the industry and so to the extent that we can be patient now and wait for more attractive opportunities at at least a more stable environment we think thatll serve our shareholders well over the long term paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think if you really look at the industry over the last few years certainly deposits were extremely cheap and rates are going up but honestly spreads werent really what youd expected historically given the types of loans folks were making so its natural in this kind of environment where people are being careful and the cost of funds are higher that i think spreads are going to expand we believe that so we cant say when but we believe thatll happen and thats why well be a little more prudent in this next quarter or two with the balance sheet as we watch what happens in the market raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 weve shown also in the other times whether we sold off covid loans or other things during those periods weve found weve shown we could expand the balance sheet pretty quickly so were not worried about that were just worried about making sure we do it in the right environment bill katz q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc understood just a quick followup and just a jumping off point there as you think about maybe paul should if you could just unpack i think i understand it was between the sort the bank versus the thirdparty sweep impact but maybe unpack maybe where we are on a spot basis for the nim and as you think about this year how do you think about maybe earning asset levels because i hear a couple different things cautious loan growth maybe some writeoff to the corporate loan portfolio from sales maybe some shrinkage on the investment securities book how do you think about maybe framing where the end of year might be in terms of your youre associated with that thanks paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah hard to know where were going to be a lot can change as we learned in the last month or two a lot can change certainly in the next six months and were going to as paul said were going to be there for our clients in the private client group business half of our loans are securitiesbased loans and mortgages and to the extent demand picks back up over the next six months now theyve been pressured in a rising rate environment but demand could come back if clients get used to the new normal in terms of rates and we want to be there to support them as paul said well also be more conservative in sort of growing corporate loans at least until we have a better conviction around the riskadjusted returns and growing that book so in terms of the jumping off nim i would expect just with the higher cash balances and the higher cost of funding which again our patience have served us well with the higher cost of funding as well because again like i said we only have of our sweep and enhanced yield savings balances in the enhanced yield savings program many of our competitors are at or so we have a lot of ability to grow those balances but as we grow those balances it would pressure nim so we think theres probably basis points or so of pressure in the upcoming quarter maybe up to basis points again depending on what happens with the rate increases and now again thats due to the higher funding sources and elevated cash balances that we plan on holding on the balance sheet bill katz q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you so much operator and the next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hi manan paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you take us through what happened with cash sorting in march and maybe since then and i ask because you noted in your press release last month that cash balances as of march 21st were near billion so it looks like about billion flowed out in last week if you exclude the enhanced savings program so maybe take us through what you were hearing from fas and customers back then and what gives you the confidence that this will slow from here paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say just jumping to kind of where we are today for example so we ended the quarter with sweep balances and enhanced savings program balances at billion you fast forward to where we are today and were right around billion in sweep and enhanced savings program balances and that reflects the fee billing that we do quarterly which was over billion and also annual income tax payments so we feel comfortable and confident that the sorting dynamic is closer to the end than it has been to the beginning as i said on the comments the average cash per account in the sweep program now is right around which is sort of a low point as far as we look back and have that data so were confident but that things are closer to the end but we dont know how much longer obviously that dynamic will continue meanwhile well continue to be offer attractive products to our clients that give them good yields and give them good fdic coverage to keep deposit balances as strong as we can paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and i think you asked the fa reaction there its been look their job was to invest idle cash and they put it in money markets and they didnt leave the system they put it in money markets and they put it in treasuries and cds to get yields and they said just give us the yield we like the program so once we rolled it out weve had money flowing in and so our job is to manage just how much of it we really need its in the system we have a very good product and were just going to have to balance that given operations we feel very comfortable at our levels right now and with the reserves we have on top that we really havent touched so i think its going to be just a process of managing how much the higher cost of funds you need given the movement in the markets so paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc one other metric that i think is pertinent on this topic is sort of deposit aggregate deposit beta since rates started rising and really you have to look at it both at the sweep program and also adding the enhanced savings program balances and on a spot basis that aggregate deposit beta has only been for us to and we bet which is lower than the competitors that weve seen so far again they have a much higher mix of the higher raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 cost funding at this juncture and thats with us being able to be more generous to our clients than most of our competitors in the sweep program so to the extent that we have to raise some incremental higher cost deposits to aggregate deposit beta at this point is much lower than i think we all expected at this point in the cycle so we have a lot of kind of capacity and bandwidth to add higher cost funding while still generating attractive returns manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats helpful and maybe as a related question then can you talk about the puts and takes on the thirdparty banks fee rate from here as we think over the next few quarters so after the indiscernible hiking rates im assuming that deposit betas will continue to rise and be a drag but i guess at the same time the demand for these deposits will also likely be strong is there some offset from the 125basispoint or so of spread that you make on that portfolio paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc theres no doubt i mean theres huge demand for deposits in the system so the extent you have cash banks are hungry for it so the question is what happens with rate and you would assume with that demand you might get the spreads should increase right so yeah so if the fed stops raising it or you have a recessionary cash returning out of the markets back into the regular sweep programs and deposit programs you think you our prediction is you would those spreads would increase but were not there at this point today so its really hard looking forward right now if we want to look forward a year or so we feel a lot more comfortable the next quarter just because weve been in the middle of since march of a very dynamic market manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so it sounds like if balance is relatively flat in thirdparty banks that you should also be relatively flat beyond the second quarter paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah well if you look at the average the average balances will be down even if we keep them flat with where they ended the quarter so but beyond that then itll just depend on where the balance the balances will drive it more so than the spreads that we earned from the third party banks i guess is the easiest way to describe it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah yeah got it okay and then just a quick clarification on the office portfolio you mentioned in ltv of how much of that is based on new appraisals versus valuation at the time the loan was made paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 its a little bit of both both on to the extent that we have new appraisals thats factored into it but i mean i think you can assume as i said in the prepared remarks that valuations are probably lower now than even that new appraisal date so but the point being is we still have a reasonable cushion and underwrote those properties conservatively but we also expect there to be some challenges if the economy continues to soften particularly for real estate paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and in that percentage too the extent you have reit loans where even our experience in and was that those diverse portfolios came through pretty well and then when you have single property loans youre more idiosyncratic and so you just have to watch but our total mix of commercial office is relatively low for any bank so manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i appreciate it thanks for taking my questions paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks manan operator and the next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global please proceed with your question jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good evening just maybe circling back on enhanced savings program maybe a clarification paul are you saying in march you had restrictions that required net new money and now those restrictions are off and if thats the case how do you dial that back if you to is it just price or just want to make sure i understood what youre saying on the enhanced savings product paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah the restrictions we open it up for sales of certain securities for people that wanted to move from money markets back into cash but certainly recently in the money markets was the spread so weve opened that up and we have two choices we can say we weve given time limits if we need more we can extend the time limits or if we want to cut it off we can cut it off or you can always do that with rate and let it find seek its own level so we have all those options and were just watching the balances were comfortable at these cash balances were actually comfortable lower but were raymond james we always seem to be accused of having excess capital and excess balances so well just dial it back or stop it or if we open it up to other securities type that you really need it and theres treasuries theres cds theres other things that have stayed on the system seeking yield so we have a lot of flexibility it just depends how much we need raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay so is this strategy from here if and when we start to see sweet balances stabilize and it sounds like at least the outflows are slowing a little bit in april well see if that continues but if that does stabilize you sort of is this a level of deposits that youre comfortable with you would sort of stop or slow the enhanced savings if you could stabilize all in cash levels at the current levels is this the defending level that you think about paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah we think were at a level even when we are at the end of the quarter when you drop to below we were fine but well well keep it so we have extra in this environment wed rather if more flows in well keep it for a while you can always again lower rate and have it flow out into other yielding instruments but yeah were not youre not trying to get it back into the thats for sure we had excess too much cash then but there was no place to put it but i think somewhere in the level well try to we would start slowing it down jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay great thanks for the clarifications operator and the next question from comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please proceed with your question brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon thanks for taking my questions one just it sounded like from paul shoukrys comments on the comp ratio that if unless we see some kind of substantial change in capital markets environment that the comp ratio is probably this is probably a reasonable zone to think about until that inflect number one is that right and then if we do see a recovery in the capital markets revenue what kind of order of magnitude would you expect to feed through and pull down that comp ratio paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean its a mix its always complicated because it revenue mix matters when you talk about our comp ratio so we expect pcg revenues to be up given the higher fees assets and feebased accounts but that has a higher compensation ratio associated with it than our net nii does obviously and so but again to the extent capital markets revenues rebound to healthier levels not even record levels but that they were enjoying in the last couple of years but just healthy levels then that would result all else being equal in an improvement to the comp ratio so again its just hard given the revenue mix i think roughly for us historically has been very low and thats been helped by the high levels of interest income and bdp fees that are not directly compensable to the producers but i think the revenue mix going forward will dictate what the result will be i think anywhere close to again our guidance was or lower just a year ago a little bit more than a year ago and that would have been historically a pretty attractive place to be im not saying thats where were going to get to but if we can stay anywhere close to this range wed be pleased with that raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay yeah that makes sense with the decline in rjbdp so one more on cash and deposit dynamics im sorry its been a real dead horse to beat here but you gave the trends quartertodate in the enhanced program which is really helpful could you also speak to like overall trends in cash quartertodate and then if what were seeing in the enhanced program would be selling out of the purchase money fund and into the deposit program wouldnt then we see you moving in the direction of the peers paul shoukry i think you commented a few times on how youre at and peers are at does that mean youre going to converge to that level or would you be pulling on some of those price and other levers that you referenced before to prevent that from happening thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so yeah the number one thing is the banking business i think maybe people forgot over the last decade liquidity in protecting stable deposits so thats number one so thats it really depends on the deposit level and to the extent weve given kind of a general target to you on the deposit levels you just you have to compete with rates and to grow them unless market conditions change and we dont know when that will happen so yeah if the market keeps doing that my guess is ours will go up over and theirs will go up over because the good this deposits reprice and youre repricing more thats going to be a trend for everybody itll be industrywide if its idiosyncratic for one institution for some reason that they need a lot more its going to go higher so a lot of thats market dynamics i think the biggest thing people forget when we limited kind of the money we put into banks for many years at and then when tristate joined we opted we have less leverage about of our deposits go roughly to our banks we have competitors at and if youre up and its not a criticism there but if youre at you got to be more aggressive for funding we have more of a buffer so well just watch it and play it by year and watch it closely and do what we have to do to make sure we maintain our liquidity and the outcome will be how much of higher cost deposits we have to have but were not doing it just to raise costs were only going to just do that if we need it paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc and the only other thing ill add to that is we have over billion of purchased money market funds our clients have over billion of purchased money market funds on the platform so all the cash really stayed within the system to the extent that and we are very little on those purchase money market funds as a firm so to the extent that our clients prefer to have the fdic insurance at the attractive rates that we would be willing to offer that we are offering today then it could really be a winwin for the client and for the firm because now that cash even though its higher cost of funding relative to our sweeps can give us generate more economics than its staying in the purchase money market fund so you kind of have to look at the holistic picture to determine whether or not its really a winwin and as paul said earlier we always strive to look for those winwin opportunities for both clients advisors and the firm paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and part of the comfort weve had is just our nature when you look at raymond james bank history they have of the deposits insured we went way out of our way and paid money in programs to make sure they were insured just as a matter of course we werent worried about we werent worried about uninsured deposits of two raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26apr2023 years ago the deposits were flush but typical for us we just looked down range and say okay for the premium its worth it to have for clients to be protected and then i think it keeps our funding sources more stable brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that color thats helpful and also for the added points on your philosophy could you touch on the point about overall cash trends quartertodate beyond just enhanced paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah as i said we are today right around where we ended the quarter were right around billion of sweep and enhanced savings program balances i think the enhanced savings program balances are over billion and again to be flat in the month of april with the tax payments and the quarterly fee billing we think is a good result and hopefully portends well for the dynamic going forward brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sorry i missed that thanks for hitting on it for me again paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc no worries paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay operator and there are no further questions at this time ill now turn the presentation back to the audio gap paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial
