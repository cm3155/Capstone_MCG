to our second quarter earnings call were extremely proud of the accomplishments and the financial results well share this morning they provide further proof points into the continued successful execution of our strategic growth plan while also continuing to demonstrate prudence as we prepare for the impacts of less certain economic conditions in the coming quarters our path forward was built with potential challenges in mind and a level of flexibility that allows us to adapt quickly as needed knowing that there is greater level of uncertainty ahead we are balancing our growth objectives with a keen focus on safety and soundness but as youll see today were entering these unsettled times in a position of strength with a focus on exiting the other side as an even stronger more agile company we produced another strong quarter of loan growth while credit metrics are at historically low levels net income growth this quarter was driven by the expansion of interest income given the growth in loans and efficiently managing our asset sensitivity with lowdeposit betas on the rate hikes to date as a result of another strong quarter of performance we believe we will perform at or above our stated guidance and loan growth and expect revenue to be considerably above our original expectations for the year we are also making significant progress in the new business initiatives and our strategic growth plan which we clearly outlined during our first quarter investor day presentation though it seems like that day was a long time ago and the environment is changing rapidly our commitment to execution is as strong as ever and we feel very good about the progress were making first maast our bankingasaservice platform is progressing nicely as we began beta testing with our first integrated software provider client late in the second quarter with a pilot solution in place we can expect to continue testing and enhancing our functionality and capabilities throughout the rest of the year we are targeting four to five additional software providers to pilot the solution by year end with a focus across various b2b segments a broader rollout of the solution is targeted for first quarter with the million revenue target still considered to be very achievable based upon the continued feedback and interest we are receiving second the buildout of our corporate and investment banking team has continued this quarter the leaders of our fig and tmc verticals are in place and a leader of our healthcare vertical recently accepted our offer to join the team in total we have hired staff members including credit product specialists and support personnel in the third quarter we plan to make a broader public announcement of these hires and also expect this team to begin adding new business to the balance sheet and income statement in addition to maast and cib we have a number of initiatives underway aimed at deepening relationships and serving as new sources of growth in this vein i am pleased that we have completed the final migration of our commercial clients to gateway our new commercial digital platform we also have continued to add new treasury payment solutions international and fx capabilities card services and integrated receivables functionality are all being significantly enhanced and we have a roadmap of new functionality that will complement our already robust set of offerings in the quarters to come we are also synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 enhancing our online account origination capabilities and adding analytics to better support our consumer bankers in proactively addressing the needs of our clients within our wholesale banking segment we continue to be an attractive platform for new middle market bankers over the last two quarters we have added five new middle market bankers in florida and this quarter we also added new leadership in the nashville market in addition we continue to see traction in our restaurant specialty group with million in loan growth this quarter and our recently built agent bank capability generated approximately million in new fee income this quarter across multiple sublines of business overall the momentum in our core businesses is generating growth and strong financial performance this success helps to fund and support the ongoing investment in new business initiatives which will deliver incremental financial benefits in the quarters and years to come let me now transition to financial highlights for the quarter total revenue for the second quarter was million an increase of yearoveryear when adjusted for ppp fees total revenue increased yearoveryear the increase was driven by nii growth a result of continued strong loan growth as well as margin expansion resulting from higher interest rates loans increased billion excluding ppp or on an annualized basis with diversified growth across the wholesale community and consumer business lines evidencing the strong momentum we have across all of our businesses and client segments commercial loans again served as the primary driver of growth as second quarter funded production was up yearoveryear with a increase in line utilization supplementing overall growth while todays economic outlook is trending more negatively our underlying credit performance as evidenced by our credit metrics continues to trend positively our npa npl and criticized and classified ratios represent some of the lowest levels that weve experienced in some time the performance of the loan book is largely a function of better diversification high underwriting standards and adherence to our disciplined credit framework it is also worth noting that at this point we remain cautiously optimistic on the shortterm credit outlook and see that our clients are carrying unprecedented levels of liquidity into this more challenging economic environment speaking of liquidity continued balance augmentation combined with account growth led to quality noninterest bearing deposit growth of million in the second quarter over the last three years we have grown non interestbearing deposits from to of our core deposit base this ongoing remix will continue to pay dividends in the coming quarters as rates continue to rise our net interest margin expanded basis points in the second quarter with increases in shortterm interest rates driving increases in loan yields while prudent deposit pricing led to lower than expected deposit betas on a cycle todate basis our strong second quarter financial performance with adjusted earnings per share of return on average assets of return on tangible common equity of and an efficiency ratio of serves as validation that the teams continued strong execution and our success in meeting the needs of our clients is leading to profitable growth overall were very pleased with the current results our continued momentum and our ability to focus on our longerterm plans and objectives now ill turn it over to jamie to continue the overview of our quarter results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 thank you kevin id like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide total loan balances ended the second quarter at billion excluding ppp balances loans grew billion on an annualized basis this represents a growth rate of our fourth consecutive quarter of annualized doubledigit loan growth ci loans were up million quarteroverquarter and cre loans grew million commercial loan growth was broadbased as of wholesale bank subbusinesses and the community bank grew balances in the second quarter the diversity of growth continues to be the hallmark of our commercial loan growth story this diversity brings consistency to our growth plan and also mitigates credit risk as we head into what could be a challenging economic environment in the second half of the year growth within cre loans was led by the multifamily sector as well as our specialty healthcare group which focuses on lending to larger medical practice groups we also continue to see growth in commercial production and line utilization commercial production increased yearoveryear and line utilization increased to up from in q1 higher utilization from lines existing at the end of the first quarter contributed approximately million to loan growth in the second quarter as we have previously noted higher utilization levels are reflective of our clients investment spend and inflationary pressures related to higher input and labor cost among other factors consumer loan balances increased million this growth was diversified across multiple consumer products including mortgage and home equity lending thirdparty consumer loan balances remain flat quarterover quarter this is reflective of our priority to allocate growth capital first to our core client base which experienced robust growth over the quarter while the residual effects of covid and the recent tightening of monetary policy present notable macroeconomic headwinds we remain confident that our geographic footprint puts us in a position to perform well relative to the rest of the country and we remain optimistic about our continued strong performance over the remainder of as we turn to slide we continue to see positive trends within our deposit base despite industry headwinds and a more challenging backdrop relative to the record pace we saw in and regardless of the environment our focus remains on serving our clients in a way that leverages our platform to deepen relationships both with deposits as well as across other financial products the results of these efforts are evident as core noninterestbearing deposits increased million quarteroverquarter this marks the 10th consecutive quarter of consistent nib growth at of core deposits nib is a meaningful component of our overall funding strategy and will help manage overall funding costs in a rising rate environment money market balances declined million quarteroverquarter in assessing the underlying drivers of the decline there were multiple factors including seasonal tax payments as well as relatively normal deployment of liquidity by clients additionally we saw impacts from the interest rate environment where certain higher cost funds moved out of the banking system and into higher yielding nonbank alternatives in many instances we were able to facilitate the reallocation of client funds and despite losing the deposit we continue to manage the clients assets beyond our core portfolio we also continue to use the brokereddeposit market as a means to manage our balance sheet and liquidity position in a cost effective manner relative to other noncore funding sources yearto date we have grown brokered deposits by million following a million decline in the first quarter brokered deposits grew billion in the second quarter going forward we will continue to prioritize core relationship deposit growth while continuing to use brokered deposits as a secondary tool to manage our balance sheet synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 with regards to deposit rates our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the second quarter to as expected the initial hikes in march and may had a modest impact on deposit calls as we were able to limit rate increases across the majority of our products however given the fomcs most recent 75basis point hike in june as well as expected additional nearterm increases we are seeing some upward pressure on deposit costs as would be reasonably expected for this phase of a tightening cycle moving to slide you can see that within june the average increase in the fomcs target rate was basis points from the fourth quarter of and against that increase our cycle deposit beta through june on interest bearing nonmaturity deposits was and for total deposits it was this is lower than the we previously estimated for interestbearing nonmaturity deposits for the first basis points in short rate increases however we expect much of that variance to be attributable to the timing of repricing and we still believe that our mid interestbearing nonmaturity deposit beta is a reasonable estimate for an fomc policy rate that is tightening to neutral this would translate to an approximate beta for total deposits with that said we acknowledge that the fomc has communicated the prospects for hiking rates beyond a neutral posture when coupled with their policy on managing the federal reserves balance sheet this could put upward pressure on our assumed cyclical beta in such a scenario we remain well positioned with an asset sensitive balance sheet which can withstand some further pressure on betas and still benefit from increases in the long term rates it is worth noting that approximately twothirds of our reported asset sensitivity is attributable to short rates and as shown previously a change in beta assumptions would impact our nii sensitivity by approximately we believe maintaining an asset sensitive position in the current environment is warranted particularly given the uncertainty around fed policy as we look forward the continued growth in floating rate loans hedging maturities as well as fixed rate repricing will support our asset sensitive profile even as marginal betas increase past our throughthecycle beta expectations moving to slide the combination of strong loan growth i alluded to previously coupled with the recent move higher in interest rates served to support significant growth in net interest income in the second quarter which came in at million an increase of million or yearoveryear when adjusted for the headwinds from slower ppp fee accretion that represents an additional million or a increase versus the like quarter one year ago i would note that with less than million in ppp loan balances and approximately million in unearned fees outstanding as of quarter end the nii and nim impact from ppp should be relatively immaterial going forward the net interest margin was in the second quarter an increase of basis points from the first quarter as shown in the nim waterfall the impact of higher shortterm rates helped to support loan yields with some offset through higher costs on interestbearing deposits the combination of these two factors supported the margin by approximately basis points and was the primary driver of nim expansion in the second quarter additionally the impact of higher longterm rates and our continued efforts to efficiently manage our liquidity position supported the margin in the quarter with the latter contributing approximately basis points to the margin through a quarterly reduction in average cash balances looking ahead while the pace of fomc rate increases and the timing of deposit repricing makes quarterly nim guidance challenging we continue to expect further expansion in the coming quarters the wider margin is synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 expected to be driven by the benefits of higher shortterm rates which are realized fairly quickly and the benefits of higher longterm rates where fixed rate repricing serves to gradually support the net interest margin slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million down million from the previous quarter and down million yearoveryear the quarteroverquarter decline is primarily related to a decline in mortgage revenue lower sba income and a writedown of a minority fintech investment offsetting these declines was an increase in wealth revenue card fees and capital markets income as you can see on the slide these same categories also grew yearoveryear and are a key indicator of growth within our core client base wealth revenue grew yearoveryear despite headwinds from a decline in the equity markets of this highlights the diversity of the revenue streams within our wealth segment in areas such as trust and family office which continue to grow client count overall approximately of wealth revenues are not directly impacted by changes in market valuation core banking fees continue to benefit from card fees which increased yearoveryear a result of account growth as well as higher levels of both consumer and commercial spend activity and on the capital markets side in q2 we saw broadbased contribution within our wholesale bank as multiple subbusiness lines generated agent bank fees moving on to expenses slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million up million from the prior quarter and up million yearoveryear which represents a increase employment expense increased only yearoveryear primarily attributable to the impacts of merit and elevated performance incentives as a result of synovus forward initiatives we have been able to hold the overall head count flat year overyear while adding head count in areas associated with strategic revenue growth on that note when segmenting our yearoveryear increase in expenses approximately is attributable to performancerelated costs and investments in new business initiatives covered at investor day such as cib maast and the buildout of our middle market banking segment as we look over the remainder of the year we expect expenses associated with these new initiatives as well as other technology and operations related costs to increase overall increases in our expense base are oriented towards performance and growth which we believe will reward shareholders over time moving to slide on credit quality our credit performance and the credit quality of our recent originations remain strong key credit ratios remain stable to improving overall and at historically low levels the npa and npl ratios declined to and respectively the lowest we have seen in over years total past dues remained low at and the criticized and classified percentage of loans decreased to the net chargeoff ratio was for the quarter in the second quarter our acl was million or of loans despite our continued elevated weightings to adverse scenarios the acl declined million quarteronquarter this was largely a result of the strong credit performance including the decline in npl our credit and relationship management teams remain diligent in monitoring our loan portfolio through portfolio reviews and the use of early warning indicators such as our analytical risk management tool these support proactive engagement with clients we see that our clients are well positioned for volatility with significant levels of liquidity and a resiliency that has been tested most recently during the pandemic the vast majority of our relationships are with longtenured counterparties who understand how to navigate the current environment we are also being judicious in approving new credit risk we take on our balance sheet synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 our loan portfolio has been built to better weather a downturn with greater diversification across industries asset classes geographies and credit metrics that support the strength of the borrowers as well as the collateral held on the consumer side our loan portfolio has an average fico score of and we expect prime borrowers to be resilient through a downturn our cre portfolio has been constructed in a manner that is weighted towards sectors with a positive outlook such as multifamily warehouse and medical offices rent growth and occupancy metrics in our footprint outperformed the nation and we feel confident that will continue to be the case strong demand has allowed our clients to partially offset the impacts of inflationary pressures we are actively engaged with these clients so that we can react to any changes related to the current economic environment as noted on slide the common equity tier ratio remained relatively stable at during the second quarter we repurchased a modest million in shares as organic capital creation was used primarily to support client loan growth our capital position remained strong and we continue to actively manage cet1 within our to target range going forward our commitment remains to allocate internally generated capital toward our strategic priority of client loan growth while also maintaining a strong and efficient capital position based on our current forecasts for client loan growth and given the uncertain economic environment we will retain the capital generated through earnings rather than repurchase shares through the remainder of ill now turn it back to kevin kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you jamie there are a lot of moving pieces but due to the hard work of so many team members this is another very successful quarter our engaged team members focused on meeting the needs of our loyal client base helped to deliver profitable growth helping our clients to reach their full potential is our stated purpose and im so proud of how we are living up to that promise on a daily basis reflecting back on our financial performance we remain on track to deliver our previously communicated million of pretax synovus forward benefits by the end of this year many of the benefits in have been revenue focused but one large expense initiative within the program was the closing of approximately of our branch network in q2 we closed branches bringing our total to locations we expect to close a similar amount in the second half of the year to complete the large scale branch optimization program as a result of our strong loan growth of through the second quarter excluding ppp loans we expect to be at or above the upper end of our previous guidance of to for the full year despite the uncertainty in the economic outlook as a result of strong loan growth and the current forward rate environment in which fed funds reaches a target rate of approximately by the end of the year total revenue growth excluding ppp revenue is forecasted to be considerably above the upper end of our communicated range of to and on the expense side we are currently forecasting to be at or slightly above the upper end of our to expense guidance largely as a result of our strong performance and targetedstrategic business investments our employee incentive structures are tightly aligned with overall performance and as such the strong forecasted revenue performance this year has resulted in higher incentive expectations synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 also as we shared earlier our investments in our new business initiatives will accelerate throughout the remainder of which puts us in a great position to begin to generate incremental revenue in the quarter and years to come given the strong positive operating leverage and considering all of the updates to our fullyear guidance our expectations for the yearoveryear ppnr growth has now increased to the mid20 range excluding ppp income i am pleased with the progress we continue to make as an organization and remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable topquartile performance the effects of the current inflationary environment are impacting our team members clients and more broadly the communities we serve however we continue to rise to the occasion to provide a source of confidence and trust in a period of uncertainty i want to thank again our 5000plus team members you are the secret to our success and your efforts and contributions are not going unnoticed by our leaders our clients and our key stakeholders and now operator lets open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today comes from the line of jared shaw from wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jared andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe just starting with a bigger picture question you know you reference the uncertainty of an economic slowdown but your loan growth is great your deposit growth is great your credit is really good how do you think an economic slowdown would actually impact your business is that theres more variability on loan growth and that the utilization rates may come down or theres a bigger question around maybe credit cost as this flows through i mean because right now things seem pretty good kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 you know jared this is kevin very good question you nailed i think where i would start is the biggest uncertainty going forward will be just on client demand and we shared in the prepared remarks that we believe given our strong growth yeartodate that we would be at or above the upper end of our loan range for the year and the real question there is will there be economic slowdowns that results in a slower demand for lending i think as weve proven out our productivity continues to increase and this quarter i would tell you our loan growth was probably more diversified than weve had it even in the previous three quarters so we remain very confident in our ability to generate loans but the demand side of that will drive the ultimate growth story there the other areas i would point to you mentioned credit cost obviously we pointed to the fact that weve had some of the best credit metrics weve had in some time so in the short run we dont see accelerated credit cost but as you noted that could change given the environment and third i would point to a couple of the nir categories whether its wealth and just looking at equity markets and the pressure we get with assets under management there and just looking at overall core client fees that as people spend less ie on the credit card side we could see some headwinds on the interchange piece so theres lots of variables and lots of impacts to different revenue items but as we sit here today we remain consciously optimistic jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks thats great color and i guess just a followup more specifically on commercial real estate as we went into the end of the quarter and after the last fed move have you seen any noticeable impact on demand or on the impact of cap rates on customer demand for new cre loans kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp well no we had a really strong production this quarter in cre we actually our funded production was up about over where it was in the previous quarter and that was primarily in two categories multifamily and medical office so where weve continued to grow is in some of our specialty areas its not across all of the asset classes weve actually seen slightly elevated payoff activity continuing were still about million to million over what we would consider the threeyear payoff average but demand is still there i think as cap rates start to increase we expect to see payoffs and paydowns subside a bit just because that churn was elevated over the last couple of years just with developers taking money off the table but productivity has been very high bob anything youd add on your side robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah yeah jared hi this is bob we clearly are beginning to see some slowing of demand as the economics of these projects are harder to make work given the higher input cost labor cost et cetera so we would expect that to have a headwind to real estate growth as kevin mentioned the payoffs have abated a little bit but theres still ample capital out there to pay us off once these loans get stabilized so allinall i think it will slow but i do think commercial real estate from a credit perspective has performed well our leverage attach points here are really good loantovalues loantocosts are really good and were dealing synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 with a good group of clients weve banked for a long time so we still feel good about the credit quality but the velocity of growth should temper certainly over time as we go forward andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi jared this is jamie let me add one more thing to this you mentioned the credit cost and a slower growth environment in the appendix we put our weightings to scenarios for our allowance calculation and in there you can see that one of the scenarios is a slow growth scenario so to give you a little bit of context that slow growth scenario has approximately annualized gdp for the next four years has unemployment rising above and as youre aware we use a multiscenario framework but if we only used a single scenario and if that slow growth scenario was the single scenario kind of like what you described in your question our allowance would be very similar to where it is today jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks thanks for that color operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of kevin fitzsimmons from da davidson please go ahead your line is now open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning kevin andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co just on the topic of growing net interest income so are we kind of in a situation where its going to be the percentage margin growing it you were clear that you expect that to continue to expand but im interested what you think about average earning assets of the average balance sheet will that be flattish in other words will you its loan growth stays where it is or slows a bit and we see deposits continue to decline will you continue to step in with the brokered to keep that balance sheet growing or youre confident enough in the margin that you can just keep that flat or slightly up and still grow net interest income in the balance of the year thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah kevin yeah got it as we look forward there are a few questions embedded in that and as we look at the balance sheet you should expect to see the balance sheet grow similar to the rate of growth of the loan book and thats what you saw in the second quarter thats what you should see in the future synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 the funding choice we make on that is purely economical and so there are plenty of alternatives as youre aware we have a lot of liquidity options over we have over of total assets available to us when you add up cash on balance sheet home loan bank advances and unencumbered securities and obviously we have deposit avenues as well that we can grow so you should expect to see the balance sheet grow at the rate of growth of the loan portfolio with regards to nii its a very interesting time period for nii and the outlook for nii going forward because the pace of fed rate increases is quick enough that it is going up faster than the rate of pace of deposit cost increases theres a timing lag between the two and so that timing lag is highly accretive to nii to the point that when we look at the third quarter nii we would expect to see nii growth somewhere between to in the third quarter based on the timing lag continuing and the market outlook for rate increases from the fed here in the third quarter that being said that rate of growth thats not a sustainable rate of growth beyond that because you have two things happening one that timing lag does not benefit you forever as a matter of fact when the fed stops raising interest rates itll be a shortterm headwind but our expectation is once you get beyond that and excluding that impact of the headwind of timing lags when the fed is down with this tightening cycle we would expect to see nii grow at the rate of loan growth plus a little bit because of the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay great thanks jamie one quick followup kevin this is more of a big picture question like weve mentioned weve been through a lot of detail on the growth initiatives and you guys made clear that the expenses are going up for that in the back half of the year but we also talked about the uncertain environment and im just curious was there any contemplation about delaying or slowing those growth initiatives and that spending for when the environment gets a little more certain or were these things really locked in and there was no way to consider doing that thanks kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah kevin when you think about what were spending it really gets bucketed in a couple of different categories first maast and we believe that being a first mover in our bankingasaservice platform is going to be very important and quite frankly opening up that channel to small businesses as we look towards the future environments going to be very important so although we could have slowed it we just didnt feel like that was prudent and were continuing to move forward with our beta product and well again roll it out next year and the full product in when you think about corporate and investment banking thats another area where i believe right now is an opportunity to not only gain talent from some of these larger institutions but youve seen from some of the larger peers this earnings cycle that a lot of growth on the balance sheet has come out of the capital markets and back on to commercial banking balance sheet and thats one of the areas we think we can play in the space whether its in the fig tmc or healthcare space we feel like we can play in that lower market cib area where the clients need to use the customers balance sheets and so we decided to again accelerate that initiative the others when you look at this expense its really around treasury products and its around analytics and i just think that if youre not investing in new solutions and products and youre not investing in data and analytics youre going to get behind your competition synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 so in reality weve had discussions around expense management but i just think it makes a lot of sense given the returns on investment on these projects we looked at this full year and if you think about those investments they represent about of our expense growth so when you think about the were up they represent about but i look out into and see that those same investments are going to represent to of our ppnr and you look out into theyre going to represent to of our ppnr so we feel very convicted to continue to invest there and weve seen success in not only the talent front but also on mass and building out the product kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay great thanks kevin kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of brady gailey from kbw please go ahead your line is now open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i just wanted to ask a question on capital or balance sheet optimization i heard jamie said no more buybacks which totally makes sense given those growth but i mean if you look at common equity tier youre kind of right in the middle of your range youre seeing good growth opportunity is there anything to consider on the balance sheet optimization side that could give you a little more room to continue booking this robust growth andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp you know its a great question brady youre right for the remainder of we expect to retain capital generated through earnings thus we believe that there are opportunities on balance sheet to serve our clients we see the uncertainty in the economic outlook and so we think thats the prudent thing to do synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 but youre right that there could be opportunities on the balance sheet for balance sheet optimization and youre well aware of our thirdparty portfolio how we think about that as a surrogate for the securities portfolio and so if the right opportunity came up there our priority would be to deploy that part of our balance sheet to our clients and so that portfolio is one that we consider as a tool we can use to manage in the environment we have no updates on that today but that is how we look at it and there are possibilities that we use that portfolio as a surrogate for the cres book and can look at deploying that capital to our clients brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so jamie you think by utilizing the retained earnings optimizing the balance sheet you can kind of selffund this growth that there would be no need to raise any sort of additional debt or preferred or anything to support the growth andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well on the capital side we do believe that our earnings will generate more than enough capital to support our client growth as you heard our outlook on client growth getting to the high end of our range at or above the high end of our range of to organic earnings should be plenty to cover the capital of that loan growth and build capital truthfully when you think about debt thats a different story and its liquidity both at the holdco and at the bank and we just manage that the same way we always have and we will continue to look at holdco liquidity and bank liquidity and make sure that we are well within our coverage ratios brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right and then finally for me yeah the reserves down to you guys are seeing good growth but it feels like the provision has to go higher its not a bad thing its growth related but it feels like the provision should be going higher here right andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look forward with the allowance we would expect it to grow commensurate with loan growth i mean and you know that our growth if you look at the marginal growth that were putting on balance sheet it is lower risk than the average of our balance sheet and so its a positive or actually will reduce the allowance to loan ratio all things constant but youre right to expect that the allowance will grow with loan growth assuming the economy and the economic outlook doesnt change and you do see our weightings to these adverse scenarios remains elevated given the economic uncertainty brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks guys operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead your line is now open synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess just wanted to followup on deposits and liquidity jamie i mean one just talk to us so you talked about mid deposit beta for nonmaturity and then basis points for total deposits which i assume includes cds and nib so is your sense that if the fed stops and you mentioned something about neutral versus above neutral just trying to make sure we get the right message if the fed stops hiking at somewhere around would that be neutral and in that well do you expect total deposit beta to be in the mid or would you expect that to be higher andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ebrahim when we think about neutral we are defining that if you look at the fed dot plot looking at the long term expectations for fed funds rate which is in the low if you were to assume that the fed tightens to the low to mid it would add approximately to through the cycle beta that we laid out ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch understood so all right so if the fed actually goes as the forward curve is implying right now maybe closer to total deposit beta and just tied to that it sounds like youre going to grow the loans and the balance sheet prepandemic the loan to deposit ratio was closer to in the range do we see it going there and whats the outlook on thirdparty loans does that portfolio shrink from here or do you expect to continue to buy into that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we do expect to see the loan to deposit ratio increase however we believe thats more of an output of balance sheet strategy than a target or an expectation and well continue to use the various sources of liquidity as we see the value and so we compare brokered deposits we compare home loan bank advances as we think about how to fund incremental growth beyond core client deposit growth and so thats really how we think about it when we look forward in we do believe that core client deposits will grow we believe that well see to client deposit growth in the second half of the year and if you think about loan growth that is approximately what we have to get to the high end of the range on guidance and so thats our current outlook theres a lot synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 of uncertainty in in the second half of the year on that you saw the flows in the second quarter and so thats our expectation here in the near term with regards to the thirdparty portfolio that portfolio as i mentioned earlier is basically a surrogate for the investment portfolio but one difference is is that we do have some flow arrangements and we have partnerships embedded in there that are not things you just turn on and turn off and so those continue were really pleased with those partnerships we believe those are accretive to the shareholder through the cycle and so we feel really good about those but there are also portfolios that we purchase youre aware of the auto portfolio that we purchased we liked that profile because of a couple of things one its up in credit two the collateral values are strong and three it has a shorter duration profile and so what we like about it is that it amortized as quickly and so that portfolio is expected to amortize down approximately in a given year and so thats not something we would look to replace in this environment of uncertainty and so thats our philosophy at the moment i would say that the floor arrangements are our core partnerships that we have and then any portfolio purchases are really similar to securities portfolio and kind of more noncore kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and hey ebrahim can i just add one thing back on the deposit side jamie is right but when we talk about building an elevated growth profile it isnt just on the lending side were focused on building an elevated growth profile on the liquidity side as well and so if you think about some of our core businesses where were growing today in commercial we have an equal focus on generating operating deposit accounts and you saw this quarter another quarter of strong dda growth you look at overall production for deposits this past quarter we were up over the first quarter and so we are focused on generating new deposit relationships we also have businesses that we think over time are going to help supplement that growth maast will be a good deposit generator for us we have a money service business that weve just launched on the treasury side that we think will provide good core deposits and so when we talk about growth its about balance growth its growing the asset side and the liability side and over time we think that the growth from the new clients will get in these businesses will help to feed some of the lowcost deposit growth that well need to be able to fund it ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you both operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead your line is now open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 good morning brad andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co kevin maybe just a bigger picture question i appreciate all the nearterm guidance it sounds like everything is going better than you initially expected the longerterm piece is that you laid out back in february although seemingly a short time ago a lot has happened if you had to kind of pick areas of that maybe where youre most concerned or on the flip side areas where you think you might get there more quickly it seems rates are going to be higher than you initially thought maybe the market has some concern over growth obviously youve got a lot of initiatives going but just kind of curious if you could hit those targets maybe more quickly than you originally thought or just kind of your thinking around those kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah brad the real wild card there is just what would happen from an economic standpoint and although the rates are providing a strong tailwind will we see certain headwinds from slower economic growth that would slow our growth in certain areas as it relates to our core businesses we always talk about the new business initiatives but our core businesses are performing at a very high level when you look at just loan growth this quarter we had growth in cre growth in ci and growth in consumer and so very balanced growth across all of our segments across our lines of business and so that gives me a lot of confidence that the core businesses will continue to perform that allow us to fund some of these new initiatives the new initiatives we said that we would have a product available to test in maast by the end of the second quarter we are testing an mvp product with a service provider or a software provider were excited to get feedback from that beta testing as we said well add four to five new isps this year to be able to continue to test it and were actually accelerating some work on maast to add new functionality and capabilities outside of the payments and depository products that were going to be some of the first that we rolled out so we actually could accelerate that and add new functionality on cib i feel like the talent that tom dierdorff has been able to bring in in a short period of time has been extraordinary im excited to have those guys in their seats in the third quarter and i think youll start to see that were starting to book some business there we actually feel that our longterm targets in cib based on the talent were bringing in we actually will be able to accelerate when we achieve some of those balance sheet targets and ppnr targets so in general i would say that we are as optimistic today as we were back in february the only challenge for us is just understanding what credit cost or what client demand would be through whatever this economic downturn is brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thanks kevin and maybe just as a followup just a couple of housekeeping questions for jamie one i was curious if you had maybe the net interest margin for the month of june and then secondly within fees i synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 know other fees can bounce around a lot falls in that category only million this quarter i know there was a million investment writedown but im just kind of curious anything else that might have fallen in that line item that might bounce back for you over the near term thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brad the margin for the month of june was materially higher than in the quarter but before kind of getting into that i just want to caveat that it benefits from the timing lag i described earlier so i dont want to read too much into a onemonth margin because there are the benefits of deposit pricing being slower than loan repricing for the month of june the margin was and just with the caveats that i just described on fee revenue youre right we had the million writedown of the investment which is largely due to market valuation swings in softwareasaservice companies but theres really not a whole lot in fee revenue that i would point to thats more idiosyncratic to the quarter i would say as you can see on the slide weve laid out our core kind of client fee growth excluding mortgage which we believe is a very important part of the story up million yearoveryear and then within mortgage we do feel good about the growth there production remains strong in mortgage and we believe that we could see some bounce back there from the million in the second quarter brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of jennifer demba from truist securities please go ahead your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning your loan growth was really strong in the second quarter and for the last few quarters just wondering what the pipeline looks like right now and could it be double digits for the year kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah jennifer the pipelines remain strong theyre down a little bit from where we were entering the second quarter but not by a material amount so we are remaining optimistic on the third quarter production could they end in double digits i mean its potentially they could given that weve grown each quarter by roughly i think the wild card there is just the uncertainty in the environment and what will happen with client loan demand bob mentioned earlier in their credit meetings theyre starting to see some slowing in just cre activity but we remain fairly optimistic for the reasons i mentioned earlier when you look at this quarter we had very diversified loan growth in growing our three main asset classes when you break it down on the ci side we had mixed codes that had growth and categories that had over million of growth when you look at it by market of our markets we serve of those markets had growth this quarter so for me what gives me optimism in being able to continue to grow the book is just the level of diversification and the fact that were getting it from so many different asset classes and so many different businesses and synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 geographies that i think youll continue to see it being able to call what the ultimate growth for the year is is just so hard not knowing whats going to happen from an economic headwind perspective but i dont want you to interpret our message today that weve seen a major shift in the customer sentiment for loans but we do know that theres some uncertainty thats in the future jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of michael rose from raymond james please go ahead your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question just as were thinking kind of longer term just going back to investor day which seems like eons ago at this point i remember the day of investment day or investor day the targets that you guys laid out were essentially in line with where consensus was at the time but with those where consensus is now is kind of come in versus where those targets are and i know you guys are committed to kind of topquartile performance but i guess as we if you were to do the investor day today maybe if you could answer for us both strategically and from a target point of view what you would potentially change thanks kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp ill start strategically and ill ask jamie to add on any targets but michael as i said earlier im not sure we would change anything within our strategy i actually felt like our plan was built with some level of uncertainty and the ability to make modifications along that threeyear journey and so the investments that were making today i think were doubling down on those investments in an interesting way going into an economic downturn i think thats the time you really do invest and it gives you an opportunity to come out of the other side of whatever this downturn is a stronger more diversified more agile company so on the strategic side i dont think theres anything we would change when you think about the targets and you said this and ill let jamie provide any absolute points that he wants to make but the important part there is we gave you some numbers based on those forward curves and based on those forecast but the important part is to know that what we committed to was topquartile growth so regardless of what the absolute numbers are in those categories we want to make sure were in the upper of our peer group in those metrics and i think whether its in a prolonged economic downturn or whether this is a short shallow recession that recovers quickly and were back to high levels of growth whatever those absolute numbers end up being we want to make sure that relatively speaking were in the top andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah really not too much to add from my perspective obviously the interest rate environment or outlook currently is higher which will be supportive to interest income so i would expect to see higher returns and then i synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 would also expect to see higher return on equity when you think about both the higher top line as well as the impact to tangible common equity where we are today and so to kevins point were focused on topquartile performance we believe in our growth initiatives we believe that the decisions we are making today in this uncertain environment will position us for shareholder value over the long term and so were moving forward with our plan michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right great thanks for taking my question appreciate guys kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you michael operator thank you the final question today comes from the line of christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning kevin and jamie i had a question on credit as it pertains to ci book and as we play through the cycle with the basis points or so charge offs this quarter is that emblematic of what we should expect over time i know the book is a lot different than it was in past cycle so i just kind of want to relate that to how that could play out robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hi chris this is bob just a comment or two on that i appreciate the question yeah i think chargeoffs in general and this is certainly true for the ci book as well were kind of range bound right now in the short run i mean all of our early warning indicators are still green past dues are low npls are low as jamie spoke of down to historically low levels almost so specific to ci book i think were kind of in that range we dont see anything specific that causes us concern right now from that perspective remember we do have a thirdparty book that kind of gives us some quarterly chargeoffs and then we have a small business book that were following closely that hasnt seen really any deterioration but certainly was a benefactor of ppp loans and as that pulls back and liquidity pulls back inflation pressures hit we would expect some there but quite frankly our passthrough levels and new nonaccruals just continue to be solid and were having to kind of counter that if you will with a heavier downward bias on our scenarios kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and i would just add to that chris the chargeoffs any particular quarter you can see in any of these asset classes some spikes but bob and i were talking the level of inflows that were seeing from an npls perspective are at some of the lowest levels so although you may see a 24basis point chargeoff in ci one quarter but in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 general what we see from an inflow perspective has been very low so we would expect there as we said earlier on the short term were cautiously optimistic on the credit profile christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thats helpful and then i guess as utilization continues to ramp up does that sort of bump up the reserve allocation there just somewhat over time andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp it does and you saw that in the second quarter the utilization impact on the allowance was million increase in the second quarter christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right great thank you all appreciate it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks chris kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you chris operator thank you this concludes our questionandanswer session i would
