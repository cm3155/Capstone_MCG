tristate capital holdings inc thank you for joining us this morning in the nearly five months since fiscal policymakers and the government initiated extraordinary efforts to respond to the pandemic and its impact on the economy tristate capitals differentiated business model continues to empower us to meet the needs of our clients and deliver responsible growth in any environment together with credit quality and balance sheet strength scalable and capitalefficient operations and a responsive funding capability this model has enabled tristate capital bank and chartwell investment partners to provide an exceptional experience to our sophisticated clients we also continue to expand our advisor network and client base during the second quarter with each of our private banking middle market commercial banking and investment management businesses growing meaningfully during the quarter the balance sheet surpassed the billion milestone with loans growing year todate by more than annualized supporting our goal of to loan growth for fullyear this is all organic loan growth and does not include ppp lending or other onetime programs at the same time we maintain what we believe are bestinclass asset quality metrics for the second quarter of we fully expect tristate capitals business model will continue to provide us with very low annual credit cost relative to peers even as we prudently build loan loss reserves for adverse scenarios our objective has always been to outperform in times of credit volatility while capturing riskadjusted profitability in all environments our highly scalable branchless model and operating leverage also continue to distinguish this company the banks efficiency ratio declined to an alltime low in the second quarter down some basis points from the yearago period total revenue grew to more than million in the second quarter up from the year ago period outpacing a increase in noninterest expense in addition second quarter noninterest expense of million is lower than the average bank with billion to billion in assets and our annualized expense to average assets ratio was just in the second quarter for more than basis points below average for similarsized banks the top line was also supported by noninterest income which represented nearly of revenue in the quarter in addition to the chartwell fees we had very strong swap fee income of million from both private banking and commercial banking clients all this was accomplished with our highperforming workforce largely operating remotely while simultaneously maintain hallmark levels of personalized and responsive service frankly i believe this companys relationships with our clients and financial intermediaries have never been stronger and we are inspired by the trust and confidence they place in tristate capital bank and chartwell investment partners our investment management team is creating significant momentum that is in turn driving chartwells new institutional and retail business positive net inflows and aum growth chartwell assets under management ended the quarter at billion thats billion higher than at the end of the first quarter and billion ahead of aum on march which was the markets trough for chartwell market appreciation of million contributed to chartwells growth in the second quarter demonstrating the positive impact of having diversified active management strategies with nearly of aum in equities and just over in fixed income tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 chartwell generated fees of million comprising of noninterest income during the second quarter with an average fee rate of basis points chartwells annual run rate revenue grew nearly during the second quarter of to million on june the highly credible performance of chartwell strategies supported by our sophisticated sales and financial services distribution capability continues to attract institutional and retail accounts in the first half of the year chartwell attracted positive net inflows of million with million of that production coming during the second quarter of chartwells momentum is evident in the breadth of its relationships today it has more than institutional clients more than retail clients and nearly mutual fund shareholders financial advisers can also access chartwell products for their clients in some retail platforms looking ahead chartwell currently has in excess of million in commitments in its new business pipeline to be funded in the third quarter from institutional investors alone in addition chartwell has meaningful activity in institutional searches and finals and its performance continues to be very strong as we go into the second half of the year we could not be prouder of the chartwell team and the momentum they are engineering particularly given the broader economic environment turning to our banking business and liquidity youll recall that in midmarch we accelerated deposit gathering in anticipation of clients potential credit needs at the outset of the pandemic in the us accordingly deposits grew by annualized during the first quarter in the second quarter our branchless and responsive funding mechanism enabled us to manage deposit growth to annualized as actual client needs for this foreseeable future became clearer and more stable we continue to actively manage deposits and excess liquidity to match what we expect to be continued organic loan growth funding costs declined significantly to in the second quarter down by basis points from in the same period last year for loans the average yield declined to in the second quarter and we maintained interest rate floors on of our total loan portfolio net interest margin was in the second quarter inclusive of the effect of the enhanced liquidity position we carried in the quarter we expect nim to stabilize in that range in the second half of the year in terms of commercial banking were very pleased with this business execution in the second quarter the annualized commercial loan growth you saw was entirely from our core business focused on serving middle market businesses with revenue of million to million we continue to add meaningful new relationships and expand engagements with existing clients in the first quarter less than a third of our ci loan growth was from net increases in credit line utilization in the second quarter the million decline in the ci balances was fully attributed to net pay downs in credit lines offsetting million and new ci loans originated in the quarter our billion commercial and industrial portfolio also remains well diversified our single largest borrower category remains financial services and insurance representing some of ci loans our billion commercial real estate portfolio is also well diversified by industry property type geography and sponsor for the majority in multifamily and other incomeproducing real estate projects we continue to have limited exposure to some of the businesses that may be most directly impacted by covid19 social distancing and quarantines totaling about of tristate capitals more than billion loan portfolio these credits are underwritten with our traditional focus on strong sponsor support and recourse tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 for example million to hotels million related to restaurant operations million to senior housing million to nonrenewable energy distribution and production and million in commercial real estate lending to projects with a retail component our exposure to retailrelated cre loans is very modest at about of loans and were confident in our borrowers and the composition of that sleeve of the cre book these are full banking relationships with corresponding deposits and treasury management services over of our retailrelated project sponsors did not request covid19 deferrals the average rent collection rate has been about on these projects over the quarter we have no indoor mallrelated exposures our five largest tenant exposures represent about of retailrelated commercial real estate tenancy encompassing government as well as major brokerage pharmacy convenience store and supercenter chain tenants our average loan size for retailrelated commercial real estate is about million on our first quarter call we reported that we developed customized deferral arrangements with fewer than loans as of april totaling some million and representing less than of all loans as we shared then in april we were prepared for another million or so of additional deferrals and were pleased to report that modifications remain below that level as of july we have just over loans with deferrals totaling approximately million and continuing to represent about of total loans importantly of these bars are scheduled to resume normal debt service payments in the third quarter we believe many clients are gaining confidence in their ability to operate during a national health crisis which is reducing the need for deferrals the pace and shape of any broader economic recovery will influence how these numbers play out but based on what we see today deferrals are moving in the right direction as loans grew by million in the second quarter adverse rated credits actually declined by nearly million to million or basis points of total loans on june nonperforming loans were less than million or basis points of our more than billion loan portfolio on june the increase in nonperformance during the second quarter is primarily due to a single commercial real estate loan that the company believes is well collateralized and adequately reserved order the sponsors challenges are not primarily a result of the pandemic in addition not a single loan and the remainder of our portfolio is over days past due this is obviously a very powerful metric and very typical for our company given our differentiated loan portfolio we increased our allowance by in the second quarter and in the first half of the year primarily reflecting our general reserve build standing at more than million the allowance represents basis points of commercial loans or basis points of total loans including those collateralized by marketable securities as we shared with you in april we currently expect to implement cecl on december based on what we know today we estimate allowance to range from million to million on december representing to basis points of commercial loans or to basis points of total loans asset quality continues to be a differentiator for tristate capital our middle market commercial lending approach and our disciplined process for these credits is a key factor in our success first and foremost we are fortunate to be able to work with some of the highest quality middle market sponsors in our markets banking proven and established operators our risk profile reflects the intentional selection of commercial clients markets and products as well as industry and geographic diversity just as important are the considerable investments weve made to build our topnotch credit analytical staff tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 in addition to our bank president and commercial president our regional presidents and seven commercial relationship managers average years experience managing these loans our chief credit officer leads a team of two dozen credit analysts for commercial real estate specifically eight analysts manage our cre credits with an average of years experience at least a decade in the business we believe this level of credit analyst experience is a major differentiator for us weve long made these career positions where analysts can advance professionally and see a path to sixfigure income consequently were able to recruit and retain top talent our analyst scrutinize individual credits and create positive friction with relationship auditors in the field to ensure we are properly managing and pricing risk another key factor to our commercial credit quality is the continual oversight we maintain for example every criticized risk rating is reviewed monthly by a special assets committee including executive management every loan that is pass rated is reviewed regularly by a component of our credit committee we also engage an outside independent party to perform a quarterly portfolio review and have done so since for new commercial loan opportunities each requires approval from our credit committee which includes but is not limited to me the president of the bank our cfo and our chief credit officer and no single person at the company including me has any individual commercial lending authority all decisions are made by this committee in response to the current economic environment we have also been in contact with every single project sponsor regardless of rating monitory occupancy rent collection and sponsor liquidity the underwriting and credit management discipline is married with a commitment to providing accountability responsiveness and an exceptional client experience to those we serve our relationships with these clients and the strength of our sponsors really are the foundation of our commercial real estate business for our private banking business tristate capitals unmatched distribution capability processes teams and adviser relationships are operating as designed this was clear in the second quarter of when we delivered annualized growth in private banking loans with record period end balances for this product surpassing billion for the first time tristate capital also processed the new record number of private bank applications for high net worth borrowers through independent investment advisers and trust officers in our referral network of now financial intermediary firms these applications were up for the first quarter and for the second quarter of last year our digital lending platform also continues to help our team to provide an exceptional client experience during historic financial market volatility while maintaining this business eminently scalable tristate capitals private banking loans are primarily over collateralized by high net worth borrowers liquid marketable securities portfolios monitor daily through our proprietary technology they are subject to favorable treatment under bank regulatory capital requirements and require no reserve these loans remain our largest and fastestgrowing category of lending representing of our billion in total loans private bank loads taken together with cash and securities represent of the companys billion in assets overall we remain focused on responsible growth for all stakeholders while building an incredible franchise of valuable and meaningful relationships for the clients and financial intermediaries as some of you may have heard me say this is a company for all seasons tristate capital is designed to not only weather challenging environments for profitably grow and adapt during them as well our business model has been tested and has proven its resilience and effectiveness

premium value to our company as a whole with a strong and liquid balance sheet and evergrowing distribution network and a team that excels at servicing clients regionally and nationwide remain focused on delivering responsible and sustainable growth over the long term that concludes my prepared remarks this morning ill now ask jv to join me for qa operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question is from michael perito with kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc jim david good morning david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning mike james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks for taking the questions wanted to just start maybe with david just on the liquidity side i mean it seemed like maybe there was a bit more built early in the quarter and that that you guys saw some drawdown on based on the kind of the disparity between the average and period imbalances i was wondering if you could comment on that and maybe just give us a little insight as to how you kind of see the cash and investment book size tracking over the nearterm here given all the kind of activity related to pandemic david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc sure id be happy to mike so in the quarter first and foremost were focused on helping our clients navigate the covid19 events as theyre upholding and so we were building liquidity as we talked to you about in march but we also built liquidity in april and may to make sure that we understood and were ready to address our clients needs as those needs became more clear to us in the second half of the quarter we started to move down liquidity in a steady and very clientfocused fashion as deposits continue to reprice during the quarter we continue to deploy that liquidity and so what youll see mike is nim starting to stabilize as jim mentioned this quarter and nii growth will start to return in the second tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 half of the year i might mention that this is all occurring against the backdrop of libor compressing significantly from about points to about basis points of spread between libor and effective fed funds and so youll see us deploy that liquidity in the second half of the year and youll continue to see us reprice our deposit for instance were pricing our cds now were extending duration on the cds and were putting new money on at about to basis points which is about half of where our deposit pricing is right now were also going to gradually reduce the amount of the deposit book linked to eff effective fed funds thats declining from about of the book a few quarters ago to about mid now and youll see that continue to decline and so a little bit of compression in nim caused by a couple of events liquidity will come down over the next couple of quarters but we continue to remain focused first and foremost on client needs this quarter and every quarter and we believe with that focus theyll continue to reward us the new business and appreciate that we take a longterm view michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful david thank you and then jim maybe a question on capital you guys raised some debt the tce ratio nudged to in the quarter up a little bit sequentially i guess kind of a twopart question i guess one do you think some of the capital building trends could continue moving forward and then two can you just maybe give us a little insight about how you kind of balance and obviously you have the lowerrisk balance sheet which needs less capital than traditional peers but youre growing and presumably i imagine therell be some opportunities to grow as we come out of the pandemic here and having capital on hand to kind of take advantage of some of those opportunities some insights there would be great thank you james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thanks mike im going to give you sort of an overview on this and what is foremost should be kept in mind is were building a business here and as we all are aware that the second quarter created challenges for our clients and our industry were proud of the results of this quarter considering the circumstances that we functioned under the effectiveness of our business model was certainly proven in the first two quarters of the year but from a capital standpoint we produced what i consider to be meaningful capital organic growth of million and that was driven really by our net income of million and the improvement of our fair value of our investments of some million so essentially earnings were utilized to strengthen capital and as you pointed out we were in the marketplace and actively raised about another million of additional capital if you look at the increase in our net interest income it actually increased some over the second quarter of and what you saw thats looking at it from somewhat of a longerterm perspective but its only a year but if you want to look at the deposit cost they dropped from compared to the first quarter of and non interest income and we have to look at other aspects of our revenue growth our noninterest income was up over the second quarter of during what all of us would consider somewhat of a volatile market in the stock bond market and interest rates our total revenue was up over the second quarter and we had a bank efficiency ratio of some so noninterest expense increased some from the second quarter of but and this is important because i consider this statistic to be really the core of this company pretax preprovision net revenue was up over the second quarter of thats pretty consequential tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 chartwell rebounded quickly and is well positioned from a performance and financial metrics standpoint for the remainder of the year the asset quality continued through this whole period of time to be best of class we increased our allowance by some in the first half of the year our commitment to responsible growth continues to be strong and meet our expectations and this commitment is clearly reflected and the results that weve gotten if you take a longerterm perspective over the past years weve charged off net chargeoffs of million over years and over the past five years its million in our billion loan portfolio today we only have one loan one loan thats passed due days or more the provision level has been earned by this company the loan portfolio has been designed to perform in the environment that we find ourselves today we have no dividend expense no interest rate risks variable expenses obviously by looking at the income statement that we produced meaningfully lower risk profile and a consequential focus on noninterest income on the net interest margin we believe the nim as david was alluding to is bottomed in the second quarter the liquidity was put on the books by design and we clearly mentioned in the first quarter discussion that it was a risk management tool in a time of stress and the stress has eased and its been put to work and what i would suggest we note the growth in the investment portfolio the meaningful growth that has occurred over this quarter and a reminder on net interest margin it really has a very limited focus it doesnt take into account expenses credit profile noninterest income duration and the other thing thats worth pointing out is these floors that weve put in place are on as i mentioned earlier of our loan portfolio over billion of the billion portfolio has floors and they were still being put in place in april and may and the average looking at the full portfolio they averaged to basis points across the full portfolio and david was recently alluding to where libor has been and weve seen it at basis points we have given clear guidance in the first and second quarter that the provision will continue to grow over the next few quarters and we fully anticipate that our provision will be in line with the cecl requirement in the first quarter of the loan yield drop it was clearly offset by the decrease in the deposit cost excess liquidity is still on the balance sheet in the second quarter and created approximately a basis point drag on the net interest margin so the reason im taking this time is everyone on the call here can clearly understand how we look at it so we continue to invest in our clients and our people our technology and infrastructure for the future and if one would merely look at our income statement you can see that we spent some million in the quarter on technology yet beat consensus by from an earnings standpoint so the first half of the year we look at as has laid a strong foundation for the remainder of the year so we look at this as a critical quarter that we got through very successfully due to the people working at this company and the commitment that they make so i hope i answered your question operator the next question is from matt olney with stephens please to ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning and good day tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc hi matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey good morning david jim as you noted the operating expenses increased just yearoveryear impressive cost controls especially considering a few years ago expenses would be up or per year as you look forward what type of expense growth should we be anticipating from here james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc ill allow or you were talking to me but why dont i allow david demas to speak i think ive commented a lot lately david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so matt let me build off a couple of things that jim talked about a minute ago chartwell has done a great job this year reexamining the cost that they incur to run their business and operations and without impacting growth or the experience of the client experience theyve been able to meaningfully reduce operating expenses by to this year for the entire franchise operating expenses are up about and driven almost entirely by fdic insurance premiums which is the cost necessary to carry the excess liquidity which well deploy as weve talked about importantly the efficiency ratio continues to improve and as jim mentioned its just slightly over for the quarter we continue to build scale in our businesses providing clients with a highly differentiated experience and were really focused on continuing to drive operating leverage as weve talked to you about in the past and weve achieved about basis points of operating leverage so far this year i think as you look forward to the remainder of the year our goal is to keep the efficiency ratio of the bank in that same range it might bump around a little bit quartertoquarter but we believe weve achieved the scale necessary to continue to run this business and we dont expect other than compensation costs which are variable in nature and tied to the performance of loan growth swap income and term loan performance expenses should be muted matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and i think going back to the discussion around the net interest income and the margin youve talked about liquidity levels and why that was elevated to i guess im still unclear on the path of the loan yields i think the floors are being put in i appreciate that james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yes tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 matt olney q analyst stephens inc but where do your loan yields go from here compared to levels james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc so i think you mentioned that about of our book has floors in place right now and those floors matter depending on the loan are somewhere between and basis points and as you know those floors dont expire they just go away as rates move up were putting new commercial real estate loans on at a yield of to million commercial and industrial loans are going on the book somewhere between and and private banking loans are going on at to net total yield so thats where were positioned as where we grow the portfolio for the second half of the year operator operator instructions james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc operator there are two people in line here operator yes so the next question is from daniel tamayo with raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc so first the million in deferrals can you talk about where those are coming from in terms of the cre or ci and which subsegments if possible david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc dan theyre mostly cre theres a mix but theyre mostly cre let me give you a little bit of data in terms of what were seeing in that behavior about as jim alluded to have indicated to us that theyre going to resume payment in the third quarter an additional of those loans have indicated that theyre going to resume payments in the fourth quarter so about in total of those loans have indicated that theyre going to resume payments here in the third and fourth quarter the remaining loans that will continue within the deferral period we underwrote those deferrals in march and were reviewing them regularly when i touch with the client and overall each of those borrowers continues to perform better than what we underwrote in march but to get back to your original question about twothirds of those deferrals are in commercial real estate prorated across the commercial book tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay but then clearly indiscernible david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc dan would you mind repeating that its a little garbled dan operator daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hello james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc dan go ahead david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc sorry we yeah there was some interference daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah no i was just asking if there was a little bit more information you were able to provide in terms of within the cre book if that was more broadbased the deferrals or if there was any particular subsegments that you were seeing the deferrals david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc no its fairly broad based there is not a specific industry or geographic area that is concerning to us its pretty broad based james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah i think dan in the script we mentioned that of the retail oriented cre did not apply for any type of relief david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc dan i guess the one item that jim talked about million of hotels obviously hotels are seeking deferrals and so that entire million exposure those loans are undeferred daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc but thats about the only indiscernible james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc maybe i could go over for you if youre really trying to look at this carefully the covid related end of it where we have about a exposure which is pretty limited compared to some of the other institutions if you look at the hotels we have an exposure of million theres seven loans there one of the loans is financing for a ground lease with an operating marriott build on the land and that has million outstanding it is nonrecourse but the ltv is and the other nonrecourse and this is a doubletree hotel its about million outstanding ltv but i should point out that the sponsor here currently has on deposit with us and has had on deposit with us money of this size for quite some time today he had some million with this on deposit and then the rest of the five loans the million are all recourse and theres five loans there if you look at the foodservice industry we have seven loans that are spread between three companies the largest loan being million in the smallest one million on the senior housing we have eight loans a little over million of outstandings and one loan is of an assisted living nature million and there is skilled nursing and that group of seven loans is million outstanding and on the health care side theres five loans million outstanding and thats a pretty good outline of this whole portfolio what i can tell you is all these are paying as agreed daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thats great detail i appreciate all that and then if i can just kind of shift over to the balance sheet growth here for a second can you talk about how the increased uncertainty in the current environment has impacted your lending both in the private banking segment as well as on the commercial side james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc i would say lets start with the commercial side i would indicate to you that our anticipated growth this year in that area is going to be in the highsingle digits or around at most and if you look at the past months its been in the midtohigh range on the private banking we feel a high level of confidence in that book of business and we believe itll be in the to range and i believe that youre going to see that portfolio being about of the loan portfolio at the end of next year daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific thanks very much thats all my questions operator the next question is from russell gunther with da davidson please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 hey good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc hi russell russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i wanted to just quickly followup on the deferral conversation please so of the roughly of that exposure that is at the time not expected to resume normal debt service by the end of the year one do you guys consider these to be higher risk exposures given that theyre in a forbearance program currently and if they dont return by the end of the year how is that going to migrate whether its into criticized classified or tdrs and what impact would that have on the reserve james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc so russell just to be clear the remaining portion of those loans are within the deferral periods that we originally underwrote in march and were in touch with those folks and so they still could enter repayment by the end of the year we havent confirmed that with them yet or not they havent indicated that to us but as we continue to evaluate each of those credits there are none at this point that were worried about you know jim mentioned that there arent any delinquencies defaults or losses emerging in the portfolio yet and so were not concerned about that remaining 30plus percent at this point well continue to keep you posted and update you in the third quarter but nothing that we see emerging or migrating at this point russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thats great david thank you and then last question would be i appreciate the update on the cecl implementation at the end of the year are you able to give us what your estimate of the day one impact would be and then what if anything could change given the macro backdrop that would result in a higher number than that million to million allin james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc so let me give you some detail in terms of how we set up for cecl in terms of some of the underlying thoughts as jim shared with you that to basis points in the million to million obviously the economy has been very mixed but we do continue to see strength in our clients who overall are navigating in this environment pretty well weve not seen delinquencies defaults losses emerge as weve talked about and as you know cecl can be very procyclical and its very volatile in the shortterm and so the drivers of cecl as you know are very forwardfocused in terms of the consensus and dont really take into account the full aspects of the portfolio quality tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 so as we look forward unemployment and gdp potential future stimulus the path of the virus and other factors create some uncertainty quartertoquarter so were looking past that were sort of locking up the noise thats coming to us quartertoquarter and were really focused on how does set up at the beginning of the year and as we look at the setup for were thinking about unemployment somewhere between to and were thinking about gdp growth somewhere between to and those are the assumptions that underlie our million to million total reserves and so that if those metrics change that obviously could change our outlook as you compare us to other banks i would remind you that our credit portfolio is different we dont have a consumer credit that other banks have the credit cards the installment loans the auto loans the home equity loans and so you have to adjust for that as you compare our metrics and the numbers were sharing from cecl perspective with where other banks are at this point thats our view of sort of cecl and where were headed into russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thanks for sharing that guys i appreciate it thats it for me james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thanks operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr getz for any closing remarks james f getz chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you operator we continue to thank you for your continued interest and
