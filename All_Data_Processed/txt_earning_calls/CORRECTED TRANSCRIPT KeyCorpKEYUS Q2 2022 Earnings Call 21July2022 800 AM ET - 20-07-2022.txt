of average loans of basis points keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 nonperforming loans and criticized loans both declined this quarter we will continue to support our clients

dividend yield of approximately as is our normal practice the board will evaluate a dividend increase in the fourth quarter i will close this morning by reaffirming our expectation that we will

credit underwriting don will cover the specifics of our full year guidance in his comments overall key delivered another solid quarter and i remain confident in our future and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders with that id like to turn the call over to don to provide details on the results for the quarter and our outlook for the balance of don donald r kimble vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the second quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share down from last year and up from the prior quarter our results in the current quarter reflect strong core operating performance and the resiliency of our business model as we continue to navigate through the current market conditions importantly we generated positive operating leverage compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year and remain confident in our ability to do so for the full year as chris mentioned preprovision net revenues was up from the first quarter with a increase in revenue and relatively stable expenses higher net interest income was driven by strong loan growth and the way we have positioned our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates our results also reflect our focus on strong expense management and our strong risk profile turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from the year ago period and up from the prior quarter we continue to add and deepen client relationships across our franchise which drove strong loan growth in both our commercial and consumer businesses commercial loans increased from last quarter reflecting broadbased growth across our industry verticals line utilization rates improved this quarter increasing basis points from last quarter our consumer businesses continued its strong performance as we saw residential real estate originations of billion resulting in an increase in balances of from last quarter consistent with our focus on the healthcare segment approximately onethird of our consumer mortgage originations were to healthcare professionals laurel road originated million of loans this quarter despite the ongoing federal student loan payment holiday ppp loan balances were million on average this quarter compared to billion last year and keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 billion last quarter if we adjust for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio last year as well as the impact of ppp our core loans were up yearoveryear by approximately billion on average or continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the second quarter of up billion or compared to the year ago period and down billion or compared to the prior quarter yearoveryear we saw a broadbased growth in consumer and commercial relationships including higher commercial escrow and retail deposits partially offset by the expected continued decline in time deposits the decline from the prior quarter reflects seasonal commercial outflows including annual tax payments as well as lower public sector deposits related to stimulus funds our cost of interestbearing deposits only increased basis points from the prior quarter we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately of our total deposit mix in addition of our commercial deposits were from core operating accounts turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the second quarter compared to billion in both the year ago period and the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the second quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter both net interest income and net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset balances and a favorable balance sheet mix as well as the benefit from higher interest rates quarteroverquarter net interest income also benefited from one additional day in the quarter both net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the lower loan fees related to ppp loan forgiveness the current quarter reflected million of net interest income from ppp down from million in the prior quarter and million in the second quarter of included in the appendix is additional detail on our investment portfolio and asset liability position as chris mentioned we have significant upside to higher interest rates over the next several years for example if we were to reprice our existing billion in shortterm treasuries and billion of swaps to todays interest rates we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of over million moving to slide noninterest income was million for the second quarter of compared to million for the year ago period and million in the first quarter as we mentioned in our midquarter update last month our fee income continues to be impacted by the slowdown in capital markets investment banking and debt placement fees were million for the quarter down million from the first quarter compared to the prior period offsetting the decline in investment banking fees was an increase of million in the other income mostly related to larger negative marketrelated adjustments in the prior quarter commercial mortgage servicing fees also increased related to elevated prepayment fees yearoveryear in addition to lower investment banking fees cards and payments income was million lower primarily driven by lower prepaid card revenue which was partially offset by core growth consumer mortgage income was also lower reflecting higher balance sheet retention and lower gain on sale margins strength in our corporate services income partially offset these declines keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion relatively stable with both last year and the last quarter compared with the year ago quarter our expenses were up million personnel expenses reflect lower productionrelated incentives and stockbased compensation offset by higher salaries including the impact of our direct investments into the business on the nonpersonnel side other expense increased million and computer processing expense increased million compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense is up million other expense was elevated reflecting charges for lease terminations higher travel and entertainment and fdic assessments we also saw increases in marketing expense and net occupancy which were more than offset from lower personnel costs reflecting lower productionrelated incentives and stockbased compensation and seasonally lower employee benefits expense moving to slide overall credit quality remained strong for the second quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of million from the prior quarter additionally criticized loans declined and delinquencies were relatively stable quarteroverquarter our allowance for credit losses remained stable with last quarter keep in mind we added to our reserves in the first quarter reflecting our expectation for a slowing economy the reserve level is based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy now on to slide we ended the second quarter with a common equity tier ratio of within our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders we continue to manage our capital consistent with our capital priorities of first supporting organic growth in our business in this quarter we certainly saw a strong loan growth across our franchise second paying dividends and third repurchasing shares as chris said our board of directors just approved a quarterly common dividend of per share for the third quarter as is our normal practice the board will evaluate a dividend increase in the fourth quarter on slide is our full year outlook the guidance is relative to our full year results to make comparison easier we provided both our prior guidance and our updated outlook which is shown on the right hand side of the slide using the midpoints of our guidance ranges would support chris comments about delivering another year of positive operating leverage in average loans will be up between and this is on a reported basis excluding ppp and the impact of the sale of our indirect auto business last year average loans will be up closer to we expect average deposits to be up to net interest income is expected to be up between and reflecting growth in average loan balances and higher interest rates partially offset by lower fees from ppp forgiveness our guidance is based on the forward curve assuming a fed funds rate of by the end of noninterest income will be down between and this reflects the slowdown in the capital markets and lower investment banking revenue as well as lower prepaid card fees related to the government support program and a step down in marketrelated adjustments relative to year ago period keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 we expect noninterest expense to be down between and reflecting lower productionrelated incentives and our continued focus on strong expense management included in our outlook are our ongoing investments in our business for the year we expect credit quality to remain strong and net chargeoffs to be in the range of to basis points our guidance for our gaap tax rate is approximately finally shown on the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was a solid quarter and we remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our commitments with that ill now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp ebrahim ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess maybe first question don i just wanted to go back to your comments around interest rate risk management and the securities book looking at the slide in the appendix just talk to us when you talk about the million upside from repricing one what part of the curve is that sensitive to and second if interest rates ph were more lower in the next three to six months is there a way to capture that nii upside donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thats a great question as far as the impact im talking about billion of our investment portfolio which is in our shortterm treasuries and thats just repricing those securities at basically a twoyear yield on the assets so its picking up over basis points on that billion the other piece would be to reprice our swap book which keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 is a little over billion and that has an average life of two and a half years and just repricing that combined with the shortterm treasuries would yield over million in run rate benefit as far as capturing that earlier we always take a look to see how we can and weve done some things such as forward starting swaps and other things to position the portfolio to start to benefit from that in earlier quarters but we feel good about how were positioned and with the opportunity to realize that over the next couple of years ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just a separate question on the outlook for loan growth obviously seems like youre not seeing any real signs of slowdown just talk to us in terms of how youre balancing customer demand capital market stuff ph moving to the balance sheet versus the risk of a downturn and maybe we enter the recession over the next to months and how youre thinking about credit quality and just tightening the underwriting books christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure ebrahim obviously the time to prepare for any kind of a downturn is long before the downturn and so if you go back over the last years we have been derisking key and if you look in areas like for example housing and gateway cities weve been dialing that back for some period of time the actions that weve taken more recently of course is we exited indirect auto last year we had a billion book that we exited and then we are constantly looking at our portfolio any place that theres leverage we focus intently on and we focus on certain places where we think theres been a runup in asset values so for example weve been dialing back loantovalue percentages in places like the west that kind of gives you an idea the notion of what goes on our balance sheet and what we distribute we do whats best for our clients and when you get into markets such as we have right now where theres dislocation thats obviously an opportunity and we went from about typically on our balance sheet up to and obviously of billion is a lot ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin jefferies please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah hey guys good morning i just wanted to follow up on the capital market side so obviously a tough market environment to execute obviously youre talking still about strong pipeline so can you just talk about just how do you get a sense of what the revenue outlook looks like from here and you obviously did some adjustments on the cost side as a result as well how much flexibility do you see on that side as well thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure ken good morning well one of the things we really like about the business is it is a variable cost business and you saw that reflected in our expense numbers in terms of the trajectory of the business the pipelines with the exception of equity as you can well imagine remained stronger this year than they did at this time last year having said that the real challenge is going to be what is the actual yield and as you think about for example the ma market theres a disequilibrium right now between publiclytraded companies and where these private companies are being priced and theres a bit of price discovery i think its going to take a while for that to shake out but in my experience it does shake out and so i think the back half given if we can get some cooperation from the markets i think the back half will generate some momentum the other thing i will share with you about this business and youve been following us for a long time this is a business that we believe in and well continue to invest in and its been challenging frankly to be out in the hiring market in this ride up in the last couple of years and so youll see us invest in this business and hiring more people in sort of a flat or down market than we have in the past thanks for your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it and one followup if i may the starting point here you had on and interestbearing deposit cost was really excellent can you just talk about how youre expecting that to traject as obviously we get into the media part of the magnitude of rate raises thanks donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure ken youre right that the starting point here that we havent seen a lot of pressure on deposit rates and so weve got a very low beta for the quarter as a basis point increase in and average interestbearing deposit costs compared to about a basis point increase in the libor would suggest about a to deposit beta we think the incremental betas will increase from here going forward and by the end of the year as we talked about in the last call we do expect that incremental beta towards the end of the year to be closer to that range that so thats really our expectations well start to see more customer changes and more competition for deposit rates going forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it thank you don keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator and our next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos jpmorgan please go ahead christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone so looking at the updated guidance and specifically im looking at the to loan growth and to decline in deposits which is a pretty wide mismatch how do you plan to fund loan growth beyond and at what loantodeposit ratio do you need to start fully funding loan growth one for one with deposits donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp steve this is don and as far as the loan growth youre right the updated guidance is to deposits are expected to be up to yearoveryear that implies relatively stable deposits through the rest of the year we do have some investment security maturities we also will tap the wholesale market as far as funding that one of the benefits of originating residential real estate loans adds to our capacity as far as borrowing at the home loan and we can do that in a cost effective way loantodeposit ratios were currently below on our balance sheet typically we would target between and loantodeposit ratio so weve got plenty of room to work through that i would say that well continue to monitor this but as chris has highlighted a couple of times we want to support our customers and in these markets were going to see more customer demand for loans than we are probably going to see for capital markets opportunities and so well continue to see that we could see that reverse at some point in time and help alleviate some of the pressure on loan growth overall steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful don how do we think about this so at some point youll reach a loantodeposit ratio where you need to be more competitive on deposits and i heard your response to kens question you think youll be at or so loan deposit beta by end of this year but if we keep moving it forward what do you think is the through the cycle deposit beta and chris just given your commentary that you feel good that nim higher rates are going to benefit you long term do you think your loan beta can stay consistently above the incremental deposit beta as we move forward beyond christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 i think it can and the reason i said i think as we go into an inevitable downturn and clearly the economy is slowing i think youre going to see sort of a repricing of risk and i think well be in a good position with the relationships that we have to garner that and so i think the answer to your question is i think it will donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp and then loantodeposit side as well historically we would have had a deposit beta of around to and i would say that our deposit mix is much different today than what it was during the last rate increase cycle that on the consumer side were very focused on core primacy accounts or operating accounts for the consumer as opposed to historically we might have been more focused on promotional money market type of products and programs and so we should see less interest rate sensitivity there on the commercial side were seeing now of our deposits are in core operating accounts and thats probably up to points from what it was just three years ago so that mix should be helpful for us to continue to manage that beta down longer term compared to what the historic levels were for us and so we will probably drift above that level but i think well be well below that to level that we were historically steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and don if i could squeeze one more in so the of commercial deposits are operating accounts is the implication from that that we shouldnt expect much of a mix shift out of noninterest bearing is that the read through from that donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp well well see some shift there just because of the impact of the higher rates and earnings crediting rate that we provide to help manage fees and so as rates go up you might see less of a need to keep some of the funds there and they might look to put some of those in other interestbearing categories but it still does imply that well see less shift than what we would have historically just because of the higher level of operating account balances steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for all the color donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is on credit quality which is clearly pristine currently chris you said to ebrahim that the time to prepare for a downturn is well before the downturn hits and maybe help us understand how we should think about how keys acl would look like in a recession so you ended the quarter at and clearly your book has changed but you also have more consumer loans which even if the credit is good my understanding is from a cecl standpoint they have longer lives right so i guess the question here is if we do have a mild recession next year or sooner than that where would this acl ratio trend christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp so obviously first of all good morning erika obviously were really comfortable with where our reserves are today a few things to keep in mind both on our commercial and our consumer side ill start with the consumer that book of business at funding is about fico scores of about so its a little bit of a unique customer base as it relates to our consumers so thats one thing to keep in mind the other thing on the commercial side as ive mentioned earlier weve been consistently derisking all of key and we also have been consistently laying off about of the risk that kind of flows through key and there were a lot of deals that were able to place that dont meet our moderate risk profile so im very comfortable with where our reserves are now as you can imagine we are modeling continually just a whole lot of different scenarios but at the moment were very comfortable with where our reserve is youll recall last quarter we actually increased our qualitative reserve just on the premise that under cecl our macro view had changed and clearly there were some more challenges out there donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp and erika this is don i can probably add a little bit more color to that as well and that if you look at our allowance it is very quantitative in the approach i would say that under cecl what you do is take a look at the foreseeable period as far as forecasted losses and so for us thats a twoyear type of period and so even in a recession you would see those two years of losses go up from where theyre at today and then well start to migrate back to the norm and so you might think that with the longer life loans as far as the residential real estate or even our student loans to laurel road that you would see that for the entire life and you really would you would see it spike in that first two year period and so it might imply somewhere between a or basis point kind of increase to the allowance but it wouldnt be a doubling it would be our best guess at this point in time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and chris maybe a followup question for you as we take a step back you and your colleagues have built key into this powerhouse superregional commercial and corporate bank and i think a lot of investors are thinking that a lot of the issues in credit and corporate from higher rates and lower ebitda perhaps may come keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 outside of the banking system and given your comments about derisking is there any room at keycorp for perhaps some market share gains if you do see some blowups in the private credit markets or are those deals just deals that you wouldnt be comfortable with any way christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp well i think there is no question that depending on how people are funded i think banks in general will be able to gain share and the nice thing about a downturn erika is you can have things structured the way you want to structure them to put them on your balance sheet i think theres no question that in this location it will be an opportunity for us to gain market share given our relationships and given that we can have things structured the way wed like them to structure because the market is obviously adjusting as we speak erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp thanks erika operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so your capital is kind of right in the middle of your range at versus to can you just update us on thoughts on both share buybacks and then also where you want to be within that capital range at this point of cycle and maybe longer term christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure matt so were obviously very comfortable at frankly id be comfortable at even a range thats a little broader than that to was just an internal range that we had put in place as it relates to capital actions first and foremost as don mentioned in his remarks we preserve our capital to help our clients grow so thats the first thing the second thing is obviously our dividend which is very important and then our third tertiary priority is the repurchase of shares and so i feel very good about where we are from a capital perspective keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right and then somewhat related as you mentioned earlier about investing even more so within the investment banking capital markets broadly speaking is that all kind of organic or are there may be some niche acquisition opportunities within those businesses christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp well as you know in the past we have bought businesses and im really proud of our ability to integrate these entrepreneurial businesses but what i was really focused on in my comments is sort of organic individual hires that we think would be a good cultural fit to plug into our platform matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure matt operator and we have last question here from the line of mike mayo wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi so its not a new statement from you but if you cant catch the ball with your left hand with investment banking then you catch it with your right hand with traditional lending or the reintermediation to bank balance sheets from capital markets so i know youve described this in the past chris and this is your old area as we all know but can you be more specific like what are we talking about we say capital market transactions dont get completed so therefore they go to keys balance sheet just a little bit more detail would be great christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure so let me give you an example say someone is trying to privately raise debt and theres all these debt funds and theres all these unitranche offerings and all of a sudden those markets frees up but whoever is the sponsor behind the deal has significant capital we can then go back to the parties involved who we have a relationship with and we would say we wont structure it the way were trying to structure it to place it out in the market but wed be pleased to put a very conservative amount of debt on our balance sheet and you sponsor will need to come up with more equity that would be an example another example would be a company that we were going to take public that we could continue to fund in a variety of ways until they go public a third example would be a large lets say its a large affordable project that keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 wanted ultimately to place the paper with one of the agencies but because of dislocation you couldnt do that thats a deal that we could bridge over a period of time with a known takeout that would be a few examples mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and your investment banking fees were down less than the biggest players down onethird versus down onehalf i guess thats partly just due to your mix upper middle market but the decline was not as much first quarter to second quarter you said you expect things to improve now i mean maybe your guess is as good as anyone elses or perhaps you have some extra insight or maybe you hear what your clients are saying but and with that backdrop how are you allocating resources you said youre going to be investing more than you have in the past does that reflect your optimism christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp mike theres no question im optimistic about the business long term mike as you know how these markets play out over the next six months is in fact anybodys guess but were playing the long game were investing in the business the pipelines are there i dont see anything happening in the equity market for example in the next three or six months i do think this price discovery that i discussed earlier in the ma market i do think that buyers and sellers will start to come together on that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure thank you mike operator and at this time there are no other questions in queue christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp again we thank you for participating in our call today if you have any followup questions you can direct them to our investor relations team this concludes our remarks thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference for today thank you for your
