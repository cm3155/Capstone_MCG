to this year and beyond now let me turn it over to mark and then wed be happy to answer your questions mark mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you mike and good morning everyone starting on slide net income of billion in the fourth quarter grew from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate eps grew including the impact of a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding as weve continued to buy back shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan revenues of billion grew from the prior year driven by higher noninterest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer as well as our accrual businesses in icg along with a rebound in markets expenses increased yearoveryear reflecting higher compensation and volumerelated expenses along with continued investments in the franchise partially offset by efficiency savings and the winddown of legacy assets and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer as well as volume growth and a few episodic downgrades in icg while overall credit quality remained stable our effective tax rate for the quarter was better than our outlook reflecting discrete tax items the discrete tax items equate to a benefit of per share this quarter excluding this benefit our tax rate would have been roughly in constant dollars endofperiod loans grew yearoveryear to billion as growth in our citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 core businesses was partially offset by the winddown of legacy assets and deposits grew with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises on slide we show our full year results looking at our progress was broadbased with revenue growth positive operating leverage and operating margin expansion across both our consumer and institutional businesses revenues were up on an underlying basis excluding the impact of fx as well as the million gain on the sale of the hilton portfolio and the million gain on the asset management business in mexico in in global consumer banking we generated revenue growth across all three regions in icg revenues also grew with continued momentum in our accrual businesses as well as growth in our marketsensitive businesses and even as we continue to make critical investments in our franchise we maintained expense discipline delivering roughly flat expenses for the year in line with our outlook credit quality remained broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pretax earnings grew by eps grew by and we regenerated an rotce of ahead of our target for the full year turning now to the businesses slide shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars the consumer business showed continued momentum in the fourth quarter for the quarter revenues grew with contributions from all regions while expenses were down driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings and looking at full year results in consumer excluding both gains in we also generated revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat resulting in growth in operating margin and growth in pretax earnings slide shows the results for north america consumer banking in more detail fourth quarter revenues of billion were up from last year we have continued to make meaningful progress against our strategy to create a more integrated clientcentric relationship model launching new value propositions across cards and retail banking and continuing to enhance our digital capabilities in we introduced the rewards card digital lending products flex loan and flex pay new digital checking and savings accounts and relationship offers for both cards and deposits and in digital we enhanced our account opening and servicing capabilities for example streamlining the digital account opening process which has roughly doubled our application submission rate these actions are resonating with our clients driving deeper relationships and better growth in deposits aums and loans and while most of the new offerings weve introduced in have leveraged our proprietary products and reward programs this year we will be expanding our reach and the breadth of our customer base with both existing and new partners for example were expanding our partnership with american airlines to include deposit products and we recently announced a new partnership with google to attract clients digitally importantly we are building these capabilities in a scalable manner with the ability to expand to other partners efficiently turning now to the results of the individual businesses branded cards revenues of billion grew year overyear client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up and average loan growth improved to while our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans expanded to basis points this quarter in retail banking our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits up with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels and our aums were up or excluding market movements reflecting strong engagement from our citigold clients citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 we saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales bringing our full year total to roughly billion versus the billion we raised in and our experience todate gives us confidence in our ability to drive towards national scale in retail as we deepen relationships over time however retail banking revenues of billion were down yearoveryear as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads finally retail services revenues of billion were up yearoveryear with continued growth in loans and purchase sales across the majority of the portfolio total expenses for north america consumer were down yearoveryear as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volumerelated expenses turning to credit net credit losses grew by yearoveryear reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios our full year ncl rate in usbranded cards and retail services were basis points and basis points respectively looking ahead we expect ncl rates in to be at or slightly above the high end of our outlook range of to basis points for branded cards and to basis points for retail services and id also note that we typically see higher ncl rates in the first half relative to the second half of the year reflecting normal seasonality on slide we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars fourth quarter revenues of billion grew in latin america consumer revenues grew including a few small episodic gains loan and deposit growth was muted in mexico again this quarter as we are seeing lower levels of client demand in the current environment of decelerating gdp growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes but importantly we delivered strong yearoveryear ebit growth again this quarter turning to asia consumer revenues grew in the fourth quarter we continue to see strong growth in our wealth management drivers in asia with growth in citigold clients and growth in net new money versus last year in total operating expenses for international consumer banking increased in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volumedriven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit was down driven primarily by mexico slide shows global consumer credit trends in more detail as a reminder this quarter we realigned our commercial banking business with all commercial banking activities including those previously reported as part of gcb now reported in icg the consumer credit trends on slide reflect this change in north america and asia this shift resulted in only a slight increase in the reported ncl rates however it did have a larger impact on reported ncl rates in latin america given the relative size of the commercial business there which had structurally lower ncl rates and represented roughly onethird of the gcb loan book overall credit trends remained favorable again this quarter turning now to the institutional clients group on slide revenues of billion were up in the fourth quarter reflecting continued momentum in the accrual businesses as well as strong performance in both investment banking and fixed income markets partially offset by softness in equity markets total banking revenues of billion were up treasury and trade solutions revenues of billion were up as reported and in constant dollars as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates we continue to see robust underlying business drivers in tts reflecting growth with new clients as well as the deepening of relationships with our existing clients including growth in average deposits as well as doubledigit growth in our cross border payment flows this quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 investment banking revenues of billion were up from last year outperforming the market wallet reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting particularly investmentgrade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs private bank revenues of million were up driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients partially offset by spread compression and corporate lending revenues of million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio total markets and securities services revenues of billion were up from last year fixed income revenues were up largely reflecting a recovery from the fourth quarter coupled with strong performance particularly in rates and spread products equities revenues were down primarily reflecting a more challenging environment in equity derivatives and finally in securities services revenues were down on a reported basis but largely unchanged in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients were offset by lower spreads total operating expenses of billion increased yearoveryear driven by higher compensationrelated expenses and legal costs and credit costs increased to million reflecting overall volume growth as well as a few episodic downgrades while overall portfolio quality remains strong and on a full year basis credit costs of million were consistent with what we would expect annually given the size as well as the quality of our portfolio for full year our net income grew on the combination of revenue growth positive operating leverage continued credit discipline and a lower tax rate on a constant dollar basis full year revenue growth was from a client perspective our revenue growth was largely driven by continued strong engagement with our corporate clients across tts and investment banking as well as both fixed income and equity markets and looking at our results from a product perspective we generated over half our revenues in banking which grew as reported and in constant dollars on continued momentum in tts investment banking and the private bank securities services revenues were largely unchanged on a reported basis but grew in constant dollars as we continue to acquire new clients as well as deepen existing client relationships and in fixed income revenues grew with strong contribution from both rates and currencies as well as spread products the combined solid performance in these businesses helped to more than offset weakness in equities and deliver positive operating leverage for the year and finally while our cost of credit was higher it was in line with our outlook for reflecting a normalization in credit trends and credit quality remained strong with roughly basis points of losses for the year slide shows the results for corporateother revenues of million increased from last year reflecting gains on investments partially offset by the winddown of legacy assets expenses increased reflecting higher infrastructure costs partially offset by the winddown of legacy assets and the pretax loss was million this quarter roughly in line with our prior outlook looking ahead for we would expect a quarterly pretax loss of roughly million in corporateother as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates as well as a reduced level of gains citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 slide shows our net interest revenue split between our markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding markets on the top of the slide as you can see we delivered growth in net interest revenue or roughly billion yearoveryear in constant dollars in in line with the high end of our latest outlook mainly reflecting strength in north america branded cards and tts looking at results for the quarter we saw a rebound in markets net interest revenues both yearoveryear and sequentially while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates and net interest margin increased by basis points sequentially also driven by the higher markets net interest revenue and turning to noninterest revenue for total citigroup this quarter we generated strong yearoveryear growth in noninterest revenue of roughly billion the strong end to the year allowed us to deliver nearly million of growth in noninterest revenue on a full year basis or above our original forecast or roughly flat so if you look at our total revenues for full year we realized growth on a reported basis and on an underlying basis with a balanced contribution from both nir and nonnir revenues looking ahead to we do expect to deliver some growth in net interest revenues this year despite the change in the direction of rates as loan growth and mix become the primary drivers and we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver continued growth in noninterest revenues this year driven by continued fee growth across both our consumer and institutional businesses so in aggregate for total citigroup we expect to generate modest yearoveryear revenue growth in on a reported basis on slide we show our key capital metrics in the fourth quarter our tangible book value per share increased yearoveryear to driven by net income and lower share count and our cet1 capital ratio increased sequentially to driven by decline in riskweighted assets in summary we made good progress in with broadbased revenue growth positive operating leverage earnings growth and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders we improved our rotce by over basis points achieving a full year rotce of ahead of our target of for the year we drove revenue growth with a balanced contribution from both our consumer and institutional businesses on the expense side we were able to hold expenses flat while making significant investments in the franchise as productivity savings continued to meaningfully outpace our incremental investments as well as offset volumerelated expenses we maintained our credit discipline growing our loan portfolio while maintaining loss rates within our mediumterm expectations across every business and region on the tax rate we continued to work to better position the firm post tax reform and we delivered on our capital optimization goals returning over billion of capital through share buybacks and dividends during the year importantly we continued to deepen and broaden our client relationships in order to drive sustainable clientled growth and a steady improvement in returns our results in give us confidence in and we are committed to delivering continued progress going forward for we expect to deliver modest top line growth and roughly flat expenses while continuing to manage the franchise responsibly we expect cost of credit to remain manageable and we expect our effective tax rate to be around in excluding any discrete tax items as mike mentioned the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for with lower interest rates slower global growth and the pressure weve seen in industry wallets in markets and banking in an environment similar to the one we are operating in today we expect to deliver an rotce in the range of to for so we expect we will continue to make citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 progress in improving our returns and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our investor day in may with that mike and i are happy to take any questions question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning mark i wanted to ask about mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research deposit growth it seemed like it accelerated throughout the year you were kind of doing that billion per quarter it seems like towards the end of the year is that a pace you think you can keep up with the new initiatives on deposit growth mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes so weve seen good deposit growth as you said through the year in both our consumer business as well as on the institutional side and that in many ways i think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy were continuing to focus on value propositions on the consumer side in order to grow with our cards customers and outside of our retail banking markets we just launched the highyield checking account and will continue to develop new products such as with our partner in american airlines and those types of initiatives we expect to continue to fuel continued growth on the deposit side in consumer weve also as i said seen good momentum on the institutional side we expect that growth to continue and thats an important metric as we think about how well continue to increase our engagement with clients and so yes we do expect to see continued growth in deposits operator the next question is from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi how are you good morning so im curious branded cards is doing well up when you look at retail services up im curious if you could talk about the compare and contrast of whats driving one to better growth i dont know if there were any partnerships or repricings or lost partners along the way thanks citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so on the branded cards side youve heard us say through the course of the year weve continued to see get good traction with our clients there weve seen purchase sales up and youve seen continued growth in loans on the branded side so growth in quarter one growth in quarter two growth in quarter three in quarter four so good momentum there a good pace of increasing the average interestearning balances and so that has been a big part and contributor to that growth that you referenced and sizable growth for the full year as well on the retail services side as you know there are multiple portfolios that make up retail services and weve seen good momentum in a good number of those portfolios but within that obviously is sears which is a partner of ours and that the results that we have do reflect the impact from sears that said weve delivered on the weve talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and i think its for the full year we would expect to see continued pressure from the sears portion of the portfolio particularly on the purchase sales and that said it is still a very profitable portfolio for us were still very engaged with the customers there and some of the spend is outside of those stores and so profitable good returning but some pressure given everything going on with that partner glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc in particular the store closures mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes and very important partner but a lot going on there operator the next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good afternoon mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good afternoon steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so mark i wanted to start off with a question just on some of the rotce guidance its certainly commendable you guys delivered on the this year that said i believe it does include about a basis point benefit from discrete tax items and so as i think about the core rate its maybe somewhere in the zone of and im just thinking as we try to unpack the walk to that to you spoke of and the fact that you do have provision likely trending higher in and assuming no further benefit on the tax side just help us think through what are some of the key drivers to help us get to that to citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so look i think its if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top line growth underlying and good ebit performance we expect that top line growth to continue particularly as we continue to execute on our consumer strategy and more deeply penetrate the card customers that we have there and develop new value propositions that we can get out to market having proven those digital capabilities that weve invested in so continued top line growth on the consumer side we do expect to see good underlying metrics with our institutional clients particularly in tts which is core to our network but also has linkages around linkages with the rest of the icg so good continued momentum deposit volumes and engagement with both new and existing clients on the institutional side and in tts and so top line growth of a couple of percentage points and a constructive capital markets environment with flat expenses and so you we referenced that at the beginning of this year and managed through that with all the uncertainty playing through the year and we are targeting that again for and the combination of that and continued work on the cost of credit and of course well continue to look at the tax line but we believe the combination of that focus and continued productivity benefits funding the volume growth that we expect to have will get us to the range of the to that i referenced operator the next question is from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi hey guys good morning good afternoon sorry michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so i guess following up well actually first more of a clarification i just want to make sure i heard something correctly you said mark you said on the corporate and other pretax estimate for next year i thought i heard million per quarter that cant be right is that did i that seems awfully high or obviously its a much higher run rate than what youve been doing what was can you just repeat what that outlook was for pretax corporate and other mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so i did reference that we would expect to see an impact of about million a quarter for corporateother that is higher than the prior guidance that id given of million to million the last time i gave guidance on corporateother so a bit higher there are a couple of things that impact that or that will drive that one of which is the impact of rates we obviously had three rate cuts in the back half of that plays through the business performance but some of it also plays through the revenue thats in corporateother we also have will have fewer gains i referenced some gains that we have from investments that play through and through the quarter here so likely to have fewer of those citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 and then we are and ive referenced the investments that we continue want to continue to make or will continue to make in infrastructure and controls and those investments will be in the form of technology and people and focused on things such as data data governance and infrastructure and so those are important investments that well be making and those three drivers will be what impacts or is underneath that guidance not all in the expense line but as i mentioned we will move to keep the expenses flat operator the next question is from jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc hey good afternoon guys michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good afternoon james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc a followup i appreciate the unpredictability of particularly capital markets revenue and i assume thats why the wide range in rotce but if we look at the second half of last year the operating leverage particularly in the investment bank has been minimal its been okay but you had as a firm you had growth top line growth with some investment gains expense growth in the fourth quarter so i just want to understand i think the upside the upper end of that range would imply some pretty good operating leverage so is there some unusual items in the back half of the year accelerated spending that you expect to slow or if we see higher revenue growth is that going to be offset by volumerelated expenses and you just cant get a ton of operating leverage just help me think through the expense trajectory in different revenue scenarios michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well let me mark why dont i start and maybe just talk a little bit about the revenue environment and what may drive so if we look jim at mark referenced the back half of the year and rate cuts but i would say throughout the year we saw what i would describe as a lot of things out there that was driving uncertainty be it the lack of a china trade deal usmca where was that headed brexit hong kong and i think we see ourselves in a position now where the horizon looks like some of those things may clear right hopefully we get a trade deal in the next couple days here at lease phase of the trade deal hopefully usmca and it looks like it should be pretty well along the path to being ratified and it looks like well get a brexit deal so i think some of the things that were overhanging some of the volumerelated parts of the market might have a chance to lift and we maybe get a bit more action out of the c suite and out of some of our investors you would see volumes pick up but i think as we look at the activities that we see and again i think a pretty reasonable close to the year here when you look at the combination of ecm when you look at the combination of dcm banking more broadly obviously ma down a little bit but i think the backlog looks pretty good and i think the forward calendar as we look into the other areas look good so one is i think theres a pretty good driver on the revenue side citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i guess id just add to that i guess a couple of things so one in the broadest sense again as we think about were targeting flat expenses with that said there are a couple of things that are playing through that that i think will benefit the expense line in and cover any volumerelated increases or investments that were planning to make so one is the productivity saves that weve talked about over the past couple of years and those outpacing investments and so we expect yet another million to million of productivity benefits to play through and that will be used to fund some of those headwinds or investment opportunities two you wouldve heard us reference a number of times through the course of the year repositioning charges that weve taken severance charges as weve adjusted capacity those were obviously increases in expenses in the year that will play out or reflect or generate benefits in again creating capacity and then you referenced the back half and particularly if you look at the icg in the last quarter youve got to kind of keep in mind that growth in expenses is top line growth is expenses expense growth but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues the volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year and so you really got to think about the full year expense base as we go into as the timing for both investments and the productivity benefits will vary through the course of the year and well get into much more of this and the forward look beyond obviously at investor day operator the next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you talk about technology spend and where you are in the process and priorities for the backoffice and the frontoffice i know its a broad question but maybe for the backoffice like the number of data centers you have or the percent of workload you intend to move to the public cloud or for the frontoffice a little bit more color on the relationship with google and where you expect that to go and then just overall with total tech spend and where you are in terms of spending or reaping the benefits of past spend michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure so why dont i start out and mark you can chime in mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so again i dont want to steal the thunder well go into a fair bit of this in detail at investor day but mike ill give you a couple examples youve asked the question before in data centers and citi at its peak had just over data centers at investor day we told you we were down to and today were down to what i would say is based on the combination of the necessity of redundancies gdpr and other things i wont say is the static number but as you get to and you run a global organization approaching countries i dont think theres citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 massive opportunity and again weve got to see how the regulatory and how the legal landscape unfolds in terms of data and data storage second piece beyond data storage is around data itself that in many ways citi personifies big data operating all the places that we operate and if you look at the way that the company came together through acquisitions and through other boltons we think theres a significant opportunity to really modernize or to take our data to the next stage in terms of giving us benefits in terms of safety and soundness in terms of giving us benefits in terms of straightthrough processing all of those manifesting itself in better client experiences so a reasonable part of the number that mark is referencing here in terms of spend is around what i described as the modernization of our data and our data approach and so were excited about that ill give you one example on the consumer side that we talked about last time and ill take you back to page again around our consumer drivers but if you look at as an example the things that weve been doing around our technology in the call centers and if you look at the upper righthand box around agent contact rates what youve seen is youve seen basically a circa million reduction in calls inbound calls into our call centers and at the same time the way were handling those calls through the combination of ivr and chat has changed where were able to dedicate our specialists to the more complex things and not being forced to deal with whats my balance when is my payment due how do i collect my thank you points types of calls and so at the same time were reducing significantly those contact rates and you can see it there were also taking on more volume right as were growing as youre going your cards footprint as youre growing your digital deposit base obviously youre getting more engagement and so were not only on the absolute level reducing the number of inbounds but were also taking on volume at obviously very attractive rates so i think that underscores or highlights why we believe and i think youve seen in the numbers that weve put up as weve made some of these investments in technology weve gotten pretty good paybacks and we think the paybacks that we can get out of the things that weve got on the slate certainly warrant going after them mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah id agree with that and mike i think about it as mike described but kind of in four buckets and so as we think about technology investments theyre investments that we are making that are directly clientrelated think about new products new solutions think about the work we do with our tts clients and as we identify pain points whether it be managing their receivables or managing their invoices we invest in other technologies we invest in our own solutions to service those clientrelated needs if you will think about client service from a client experience point of view and the investments that were making to do things like streamline onboarding i referenced that regarding digital customers onboarding but we also invest a lot in how we onboard our corporate clients in new countries as we enter markets with them those are technology investments thats the second bucket the third bucket is just how we streamline our own operations our own internal processes how we do more in the way of automation less manual reconciliation and manual work theres an opportunity therefore to manage data from input straight through output as mikes referenced and there are and paybacks on the streamlining of internal processes and then the fourth bucket and i separate it because of in part because of its significance mike has referenced before which is cyber and so cyber is a very important technology investment for us to both protect the franchise and protect our clients and weve been growing that over the past five years and expect to continue citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 to grow our investment in cyber so just another way to think about the lens that we look at the technology investment and need for it as we go into operator the next question will come from erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yes thank you good afternoon mike does the to rotce for this year fully capture the potential of the franchise or and i expect you to give us more detail on investor day or do you think continued improvement could be realized from here if we keep the rate curve fairly flat and theres no major change in the global economic outlook michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah again weve kind of talked about the steps along the way and you mentioned the word improvement and improvement is paramount in terms of the way were approaching and we think weve got the ability using technology client engagement wallet share gains a lot of the levers that weve spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i completely agree i mean we are focused on significant improvement over time weve made progress over the past couple of years when we talked last about our underlying performance consumer and the icg we pointed to consumer as having the opportunity to close the gap between where we were two years ago and something we thought was up in the or so were making good progress on that we think theres continued upside there we also have talked about when you think about our tce and how its broken out between consumer icg and corporateother we know that over time some portion of what we have in corporateother the tce thats tied to the excess capital that we have the dta citi holdings over time that will work itself down and that in and of itself will contribute to improved rotce so weve got a real sense of urgency to improve our rotce responsibly over time and we intend to continue to do that erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc welcome operator the next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good afternoon i was wondering if you could citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good afternoon matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc just talk about what youre working on in the equities business obviously its been an area of focus in the last few years and you had some signs of progress a tough quarter this quarter i dont want to kind of overplay it its only a few percent of revenue but youre very strong and gaining share in ficc strong and seems like gaining some share in banking and its still kind of call it the missing piece in the puzzle from my perspective so maybe if you could just talk about kind of the strategic outlook there and what youre working on michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure so as you recall several years ago we embarked on the mission and at the time we were about number nine of moving into the top five today we find ourselves at number six and along the way weve consistently taken share and this year probably not so we look like based on some coalition data in others were probably kind of flat to market but not certainly not where we want to be and not where this ends i think as we look at things that weve done youve seen us adjusting in particular frontend capacity against the business in particular in terms of cash making investments in delta one derivatives prime broker but i would also urge you not just to look at what we post as the trading revenues call it roughly billion for the year i think youve got to look at the aggregate business which include gcm about another billion of revenue as well as our securities services business about another billion of revenue so as we look at and think about our equity business its about a billion business to us so it is in aggregate a meaningful business that being said we still have our objective to break top five that being said we still think we can improve profitability and returns in the business but again were focused on the endtoend the pretrade the trade post trade and trying to maximize the overall benefits of that to our franchise but matt more more more work to do there operator the next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi betsy mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions one on the capital side of the rotce i think you did indicate that you feel like you have some more opportunity there to give back excess capital i guess i wanted to understand in the most recent ccar cycle do you feel like you maxed out that ask or that you are holding back and im just asking because im wondering if we should be expecting an acceleration from here as we go into ccar cycle mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks so weve obviously worked down over time much of the excess capital that we had weve gone from having the cet ratio somewhere around or so and kind of working that down to well end the year roughly at and so therell be less excess thats there we obviously will go through the ccar process as weve done in the past and try to responsibly come up with as much as we can return to shareholders that is an important driver in us delivering on the continued progress that weve talked about we obviously would want to and will first look to what opportunities for growth of the business exist so out of the earnings were able to generate and first to fund that growth and then with whats left and available to shareholders including the benefits from the reduction in the disallowed dta that weve been targeting from yeartoyear we would look to distribute that both in the form of continued dividends as well as buybacks and so there is some excess thats there obviously there are a number of factors that go into that analysis including the scenario and so on and so forth but well continue down the path of returning as much as we responsibly can and it makes sense given the growth trajectory that we see betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and so on your to rotce goal is the degree of capital youre envisioning returning i would think a function of that range as well like that range is being driven in part by the capital i know you discussed the mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so the yeah the range does include continued return of capital not at the payout ratios weve seen in the past but for the reasons that ive mentioned but absolutely it includes a competitive continued payout in that to range to rotce range betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right okay and then just separately on your card guidance you gave some guidance for card net chargeoffs both on the branded and the retail partner card and i guess im wondering does that include your expectation for what daytwo cecl impact is likely to be and maybe you could speak a little bit to how youre thinking about cecl what your assumptions are for the reasonable supportable period of cecl from an economic input perspective mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure let me kind of break that in two pieces if i can so the on the guidance that i gave regarding cost of credit in cards or ncl rates i should say in cards i referenced that would be a little bit above the to citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 basis points of a mediumterm target that wed set for branded and my reference there and i think ive mentioned this in the past is that weve seen a higher percentage of conversion into average interestearning balances and so with that higher volume than expected which is a good thing that comes with its a profitable highquality volume activity but with that comes higher ncls and so much of the increase that i referenced that would put us potentially outside of that range is driven by that in terms of we have and how we think about our forecast and certainly the range that ive articulated we have factored in the impact of how we think about cecl weve ive referenced in the past a range of roughly to on the high end in terms of the dayone impact we expect the dayone impact to increase the reserves by roughly to get a little bit more precise or roughly billion so inside of the range that ive communicated in the past the regulatory capital from a regulatory capital perspective that will be about basis points of cet capital in with a full impact of about basis points by the time we get to the first quarter of as you would imagine the significant build is on the consumer side so to your reference to cards its being driven by cards and that is based on the increased coverage from months to about months and so thats the more significant piece its offset by a decrease in the corporate build which nets down to about the billion you referenced kind of day two and well talk more about that im sure in the forward quarters but there are obviously a number of moving variables that go into that calculation whether itd be kind of economic conditions or the seasonality of the business there are a number of factors there that impact day two and weve considered that as we look at our forecast and as ive given you that range it factors in that consideration betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc welcome operator the next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks thanks a lot good morning just a question on capital i know were all waiting just the finalization of seb and the stress test framework also coming out of the yearend any i assume that there was no change to your gsib where you landed and all and so i guess just the question is just what are you how are you setting up in terms of the expectations for regardless of timing around seb any potential changes to what the final framework might look like and any anticipated changes to how you have to think about that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so i guess ill first just address directly your reference to the gsib score at the third quarter we ended up at about which is right below the and so still in the bucket we end we should end the fourth quarter well into or inside of that bucket as well so below the in the low or so just given some of the seasonality that we see and the focus that we obviously put on on ensuring that were managing the business in a responsible way and so bucket is where we expect to be for by the yearend or for the yearend here citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 in terms of the stress capital buffer weve heard as youve heard a lot of a number of comments around the interest in getting something out for this next ccar cycle we havent seen anything as of yet that would need to come out i think by middle of february we obviously are continuing with the normal planning of our ccar submission when i think about how we consider that or how we factor that in i kind of go back to the cet1 ratio that we managed to of about and we have kind of a number of buffers in there but one buffer in there to account for our estimation of the impact of the stress capital buffer so about basis points above the capital conservation buffer that we have there and then we also have a management buffer and so my thinking is that as that as we get more information and clarity on the proposal we should be able to cover that inside of how were managing the target that we already have for ourselves the final point ill make is that we continue to take some comfort in the regulators comments and views that whatever we do with any one of these proposals including the seb that were targeting capital neutrality across the industry and want to take a holistic approach that is factoring in how each of these proposals will work together in an integrated fashion while preserving that capital neutrality so ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it understood and just outside of the seasonality is there anything that just given the environment and some of the ins and outs of say balance sheet the volatility seasonality got you inside that gsib thanks for clarifying that and anything else just changing in terms of just flows that you see from the business outside of normal course thats coming via the repo markets the fed balance sheet expansion or is it just really was a seasonality mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc it was seasonality and we obviously work to ensure that we were meeting client needs while being able to deliver inside of that bucket but nothing outside of that nothing related to kind of the repo activity as you mentioned in the market ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator the next question is from brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks yeah just a quick question on the nir guidance can you just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes that get you comfortable with being able to grow in and then also whats the macro assumptions youre using behind that thanks citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so as i mentioned we expect kind of total revenue growth in with a mix from both nir and nonnir we would expect that that would be driven by both loan growth as well as mix to get to that nir growth thats there therell probably be some or there will be some kind of volatility on a quarterly basis just due to the idea that nir has market business nir that flows through there as well and i walked through that dynamic last quarter but we do expect loan growth and mix to be primary drivers there offsetting obviously some of the pressure in terms of the impact of rates of interest rates and your point around kind of how we think about the forward look as we plan for similar to whats out there in the way of the forward curve weve assumed one additional rate cut of about basis points towards the back end of so will have the full impact of the three cuts we saw in the back half of and assumed one incremental rate cut in the back half of brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc welcome operator the next question is from marty mosby with vining sparks please go ahead marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp thanks for taking the question and the net interest margin kind of bounced around and its not really at or trending like what you would see in the rest of the group so i just was curious the positive benefit you got this quarter it didnt seem like the balance sheet really accretive looked like it was a real positive earnings impact because nii was stronger is it more sustainable or how do you kind of what are the bearings that kind of move that as we go forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so the net interest margin grew by about basis points quarteroverquarter and much of that as i mentioned earlier was driven by the markets revenue so we saw a big uptick obviously yearoveryear as the fourth quarter rebounded and so that mix resulted in an increase in the nim to and as we go forward i havent really i havent given a forecast on nim going forward i have spoken obviously as i just mentioned to nir and nonnir but obviously all of the factors you would imagine such as the loan growth and the mix and all of those things will factor into how nim plays out in the balance of marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp and then mike i wanted to ask you at the last investor day the citigroup hosted it really was about capital you also then talked about how you had to invest in the business and the overall revenue outlook it was pretty dicey it feels like were in a totally different place where revenue is starting to pick up a little momentum the investment citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 that was required over the last couple of years youve accomplished that so maybe not as much going forward so the dynamic have kind of moved away from just capital as being the driver to actually now the fundamentals of the business starting to perk up a little bit going into this next investor day michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well marty id love to tell you its an easy environment but i think as we look towards the future i think one is that our levels of client engagement and what youve seen since investor day we talked about revenue gains coming off of kind of potential wallet expansion but in particular market share gains and i think as you look across all of our businesses or certainly most of our businesses weve had that and i would expect at investor day were going to talk more about that as the things we do i think continue to resonate with the clients as the investments that weve made in our products the investments that weve made in service i think continue to reap good benefits youll hear us talk again about continued expense discipline but at the same time youll hear us talk about the investments in technology and technology infrastructure and those pieces which we think gives a multiple benefit to safety soundness gives a benefit to customer experience and obviously gives a benefit on the cost side of things so again i think as you cite i think the big outsized times of capital return versus net income are probably coming to an end but i think at the same time the momentum in the franchise accelerates marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp thanks operator the next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good afternoon mike and mark michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey gerard mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark i know you just gave us some of the assumptions that you guys are looking on the macro for your revenue growth for if were just talking on this call a year from now you guys have betterthanexpected than modest total revenue growth what are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so when i think about there are a couple of i think critically important factors that i look to one is continued execution on our north america consumer strategy weve gotten some good momentum through the course of weve made meaningful progress in terms of the capabilities to more deeply penetrate our customers weve seen good client engagement across that portfolio and so that continued momentum playing into and to the extent that it plays in even more significantly i think youll see that as we penetrate more customers as we grow volumes with those customers as they use our products and services more whether through purchase sales or any of the other metrics with citigold households et cetera the second category is as i think about our global corporate client and our institutional clients group and the continued good and great engagement that were seeing with those clients not just in in tts around the world not just existing clients but new clients that weve been able to onboard and grow with very rapidly not just with cash management products but also with capital markets offerings like our fx capabilities and the benefits that those clients are realizing as we invest in technologies that bring those product capabilities together were so to create solutions that allow them to run their operations more efficiently and so more traction there would be a second thing that you would look to i think and then the third thing would be something that one of the things mike has referenced to a number of times on this call but that discipline around the need to invest across the franchise and not just in growth but certainly in growth around those important capabilities but also in how we improve the way we go to market the way we run our businesses and the efficiency around that i think the combination of those things and return of capital obviously will be the things that youll be able to look at at the end of and have a greater sense of clarity as to why we ended up where we ended up andor better than that range i dont know if theres anything you want to add to that yeah michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well said gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thank you and tying into some of your answer mark mike obviously the consumer business credit cards is a great example as economies of scale in the community banks in the states and even some of the regional banks really cannot compete with you and your peers at a profitable level that most investors would find acceptable if we shift over now to the capital markets business and i know you have that economies of scale in treasury and trade solutions do you think mike in three four years could the capital markets be something similar to the credit cards where the five dominant banks really kind of run the show like in credit cards for example michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think gerard youre already seeing some of that and we can cite different examples but one is in europe the fact today that in europe the top five banks in the market space are all us banks right and by nature of the businesses those banks are largely all certainly we are operating at scale in the businesses that were in and so scale matters and we measure scale lots of different ways and certainly in the consumer business but also in the institutional business part of scale is your ability to invest control and build your tech stack your tech citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 infrastructure to make sure that youre at or out in front in terms of the evolution of the business so i think you continue to see consolidation in the capital markets space gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you operator the next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks a couple of questions mark firstly on drivers on revenue growth as well as an outlook for when i look at your revenue growth for as a starting point you had about billion increase in securities gains and the tradeweb gains well i assume that was about so i guess the question is as you look out to do you expect these securities gains indiscernible do you have any impact on volume or onetime gains and also what are your assumptions for rates outside the us mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc vivek i apologize i just have had a hard time hearing your question i really apologize if you could repeat that please vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sure when you look at revenue growth if you look at the revenue growth it was when i look at it on a core basis excluding tradeweb gain and billion increase in securities gains it was about on full year for when you look at your guidance mark are you expecting more securities gains or these gains to continue ph and against some further sales of businesses or portfolios and also what assumption do you have for rates outside the us mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so there are a couple of questions in there as i think about our forwardlook and estimate of revenue growth we are expecting net revenue growth from all of the buckets that ive described so core underlying revenue performance is whats going to drive what we see going into id be careful about looking at just through the items that you mentioned there there are other things that dont necessarily reflect the underlying strength of the franchise there are some so anyway theyre just being careful about kind of narrowing it to just those two things but the answer to your question is in fact that we see good underlying growth in our businesses in terms of the forward look on rates i guess what id point you to is if you look at kind of our interest rate exposure thats in our q and will ultimately be in our k we often talk about the impact of a basis point move citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 there is an analysis there for both us dollar and nonus dollar and you will see that the nonus dollar impact to get to your question around nonus rates is not a material impact on a quartertoquarter basis its a little bit less than million a quarter for a basis point shift in the nonus dollar rates and obviously there are a number of different countries that make up that but its less than million vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and i have a question for mike mike just going back to the equities business and i recognize its a relatively small business but i know you had big hopes for this business with a billion increase in revenues a couple of years ago when you were talking about it recently youve had some head count cuts so i know youve already put more capital to work in the prime finance business so what do you do what can you do tangibly now differently to really get that revenue growth going again because full year was you were at the low end of where youve been in the last five years michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah we prior to and well see where the coalition data and other data shuttles but it seems like were coming in somewhere about flat to market wallet where had the past several years taken share so one is weve got to get back on the track of taking share i think the second piece is that weve got to continue to assess the capacity of our front end and continue to use technology to drive parts of our lower or lowtouch business i think we feel pretty good about the derivative space i think we feel good about delta one we feel good about prime broker we feel good about our securities services businesses and all of those are obviously higher returning businesses ie in some cases less capital and again i think based on the nature of the clients that we cover the consolidation of assets not just in the us but around the world we think weve got the ability to face off against those continuing to take share and again as we pull the business together to drive returns and have it make sense thanks vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc if i may one quick one mark you went to the high end on cecl day one from the to given that the economic environment has held up pretty well any color on what brought you towards the high end is it a shift in your card business which also drove that little increase in chargeoffs or is there something else mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc again it was just a there was no particular change as we work through it we obviously developed our model there were shifts in balances but there are a number of different factors that go into that and i think ive been communicating guidance towards the high end not just on this call where i talked about the actual number but on the last couple calls and so no meaningful shifts that id point to vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator the final question is a followup from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i wasnt able to get this in earlier just as you look at efficiency clearly your guidance implies better efficiency ahead and its improved in the last several years but when we slice and dice the numbers different ways it doesnt seem to be as efficient as it could be if you take out cards for example so where do you how much does technology help keep the expenses flat and where do you think efficiency can go in the short term and the long term and just i had also asked a prior question about the google relationship if i can throw that in too michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so ill start with google and mark you can chime in as well so were out with the announcement obviously q1 to q2 were going to be launching some products here in the us for them and so were not out with the exact design of that but more to come in the nottoodistant future mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and on the operating efficiency in the earnings deck we kind of showed a chart on page of just the ltm efficiency ratio and there youd see weve got this continued downward trend for the year basis points of improvement what i would say mike is that we put out a target we put out a target not just on returns but on flat expenses again this year were gearing up for investor day were going to make sure that we can talk to how we think about the future but also how we think about technology and the role that it plays now and going forward weve given you some descriptions on the benefits that accrue to the firm from the investments weve made already i think weve demonstrated proof points of those generating productivity savings consistently and we expect that to continue but in terms of much more detail around the technology benefits or around how we think about beyond id ask that you kind of wait for us to get to investor day where we can talk about it in a more holistic way mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess ill reserve may on my calendar thanks a lot michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2020 operator at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments
