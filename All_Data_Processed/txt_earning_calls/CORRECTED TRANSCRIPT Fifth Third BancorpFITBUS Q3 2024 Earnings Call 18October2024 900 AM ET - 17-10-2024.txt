fifth third we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments but rather by how they navigate uncertain ones our focus on stability profitability and growth in that order has served us well in this dynamic operating environment and continues to produce strong and predictable results this morning we reported earnings per share of or excluding certain items outlined on page of the release exceeding the guidance we provided in our second quarter earnings call we produced a return on equity of the best among peers who have reported thus far and the most stable on a trailing 12month basis our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to in the third quarter head count declined yearoveryear despite continued investments in our growth strategies we achieved sequential positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter without the need to expend shareholder capital on an investment portfolio restructuring charge and are in a position to achieve positive operating leverage on both the sequential and the yearoveryear basis in the fourth quarter despite changes throughout the year on interest rates economic activity and market demand as we come into the homestretch for i am pleased to say that fifth third should deliver nii fees expenses and credit costs within the full year guidance ranges we provided back in our january earnings call before i hand the call over to bryan to provide additional detail on our financial results and outlook i would like to take a minute to highlight the ways in which our strategic growth investments which have been consistent over several years are providing longterm organic growth that is not macro environment dependent in our consumer bank consumer households grew over the prior year punctuated by household growth in the southeast the release of the fdics annual summary of deposits during the quarter provided an additional means to benchmark our performance for the second year in a row fifth third was number one among all large banks in yearoveryear retail deposit growth measured on a capped branch deposit basis we maintained or improved our market position in every market where we compete in our midwest markets we maintained our number two overall position behind jpmorgan in our southeast markets we maintained our number six overall position and significantly closed the gap to our top five goal we grew retail deposits nearly yearoveryear and gained meaningful market share in of our focused msas in the southeast we will open up de novo branch locations in the fourth quarter and plan to accelerate the pace of openings through at which time we will have nearly half our network or more than branches in total in the southeast in our commercial bank we continued to expand our middle market presence and to invest in commercial payments over the past months we have increased relationship manager head count by over in our southeast and expansion markets including opening commercial banking offices in birmingham kansas city and in the central valley third quarter middle market loan production was the highest in five quarters led by the southeast markets which were up sequentially and over over the prior year our commercial payments business grew net fee equivalent revenues by yearoveryear in the quarter and we processed trillion dollar volume new line in our managed service offerings continued to lead the way in terms of growth that is delinked from our balance sheet over of all new commercial payments relationships added this year have been payments led with no credit attached fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 in our wealth and asset management business we achieved record quarterly revenues growing by year overyear total assets under management have grown billion in the past year or up to billion our fifth third private bank fifth third securities and fifth third wealth advisors business units all continued to generate strong performance turning to capital our strong profitability and disciplined balance sheet management are providing growth capacity and the opportunity to increase capital return to shareholders this quarter we increased our common dividend by to per share and executed million in share repurchases even with these actions our cet1 ratio increased to this will allow us to increase share repurchases in the fourth quarter by million with the potential to increase further depending on the level of loan growth realized during the quarter looking ahead to the remainder of the year and the beginning of next while we feel more optimistic today about the nearterm outlook for the economy we also recognize that crosscurrents including reversals in interest rate rallies volatility and jobs reports stickiness and inflation and geopolitical uncertainty could produce a wide range of potential economic outcomes we will continue to manage fifth third with a focus on stability profitability and growth in that order and to stay liquid and conservatively positioned while investing with the long term in mind lastly id like to take a moment to express our sympathies to all those who have been impacted by hurricane helene and hurricane milton we recognize the hardships that arise from such devastating events and i would like to also thank all our employees who have answered the call to support our customers and communities at this time in the days since the hurricanes youve worked tirelessly to reopen branches and check in on customers you staffed the fifth third financial empowerment bus to enable those who lost power and internet access to apply for fema disaster relief your dedication to serve in the face of these natural disasters is inspiring thank you for living our core values with that i will turn it over to bryan to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook bryan d preston chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks tim and thank you to everyone joining us today were pleased that our third quarter results once again demonstrated the strength of our company our wellpositioned balance sheet and diversified fee income streams drove sequential adjusted revenue growth that revenue performance combined with our ongoing expense discipline resulted in sequential preprovision net revenue growth in the third quarter on an adjusted basis as tim mentioned our profitability remained strong which allowed us to continue to accrete capital while repurchasing shares and raising the quarterly common dividend our cet1 ratio grew to at the end of the quarter and our tangible book value per share inclusive of aoci increased compared to june and from a year ago highlighted on page two of our release our reported results were impacted by certain items including costs related to the visamastercard interchange litigation and some severance recognized during the quarter as we continue to work to drive efficiencies and automation net interest income for the quarter was over billion and increased sequentially and net interest margin improved basis points increased yields on new loan production were the primary driver of this improvement and more than offset the impact of increased interestbearing core deposit costs which were wellmanaged and up only basis points compared to the prior quarter with the fed funds rate cut at the end of the quarter in fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 september we experienced our first monthovermonth decrease in interestbearing core deposit costs during this rate cycle while total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially we are seeing some signs of life loan production rebounded for both middle market and corporate banking with strong contributions from the georgia and chicago regions as well as the energy and tmt verticals for the commercial portfolio average loans decreased primarily due to increased pay downs and softness in revolver utilization which declined during the quarter to average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were up from the prior quarter primarily reflecting an increase in indirect auto originations which continued to be a significant contributor to our fixed rate asset repricing during the quarter we saw a basis points of pickup on the front bookback book repricing in this portfolio diving further into deposits average core deposits were up sequentially driven by higher money market balances offset by a decrease in savings and cds this core deposit balance performance combined with our welltimed longterm debt issuance during the quarter has allowed us to pay down highercost shortterm wholesale borrowings as a result our rates paid on total interestbearing liabilities decreased basis point sequentially our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs as we have officially entered the ratecutting cycle since mid2023 we have been increasing our testing of price sensitivity in our deposit book to be well prepared for this phase of the cycle we remain confident in our ability to manage liability costs to drive net interest income performance in the fourth quarter and beyond demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were during the third quarter down from the prior quarter this level is consistent with our expectations from july and we expect dda mix to stay around for the remainder of the year by segment average consumer and wealth deposits were stable sequentially while commercial deposits increased we ended the quarter with full category lcr compliance at and our loantocore deposit ratio was down from the prior quarter moving on to fees excluding the impact of the security gains and the visa total return swap adjusted noninterest income increased compared to the yearago quarter as tim mentioned our commercial payments and wealth businesses delivered strong fee results with both achieving doubledigit revenue growth over the prior year driven by our sustained strategic organic growth investments in products and sales personnel in commercial payments revenue increased as we continue to acquire new clients in traditional treasury management products our managed service offerings and in new line in wealth our aum increased to billion up over the prior year driven by strong inflows from fifth third wealth advisors and market performance fees of million this quarter were a record high led by strong transactional activity at fifth third securities and the fee benefit from the aum growth our capital markets business rebounded this quarter as bond issuance and trading as well as rate hedging activities picked up fees grew over the prior year also led by our debt capital markets business the security gains of million were from the marktomarket impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is more than offset in compensation expense fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 moving to expenses excluding these items noted on page of our release our adjusted noninterest expense was up from the yearago quarter and increased sequentially primarily due to increases in performance based compensation due to the strong fee generation the impact of the previously mentioned nonqualified deferred compensation marktomarket and continued investments in technology branches and sales personnel shifting to credit the net chargeoff ratio was basis points slightly better than our expectations from early september and down basis point sequentially commercial chargeoffs were basis points down basis points sequentially and consumer chargeoffs were basis points up basis points from a seasonally low second quarter early stage delinquencies to days past due decreased basis points to basis points which remained near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade npas increased million during the quarter and the npa ratio increased basis points to basis points in line with our 10year average and remains below the peer median level commercial npas increased million from the prior quarter within our ci portfolio npas increased million due to increased inflow activity which given the nature of the commercial business will be uneven from quartertoquarter on a yearoveryear basis ci npas are down million our cre portfolio continues to perform well with no net chargeoffs during the quarter and an npa ratio of only basis points the increase in our commercial mortgage npa is related to a single senior living credit in our owneroccupied portfolio consumer npas increased million from the prior quarter approximately half of this increase was driven by a recent change in policy related to our consumer nonaccrual processes to better align our policies across asset classes and primarily impacted our returntoaccrual timing for loans that are paying in full and current overall we are not seeing any broad credit weakening across industries or geographies from a credit perspective we do not expect hurricane helene to have a material impact on losses and we are continuing to assess the impact of hurricane milton our acl coverage ratio increased basis point to and included an million reserve bill we continue to utilize moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings moving to capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of significantly exceeding our buffered minimum of reflecting strong capital levels our pro forma cet1 ratio including the aoci impact of the securities portfolio is we expect continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio given that of the afs portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations assuming the forward curve is realized approximately of the aoci related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of increasing tangible book value per share by before considering any future earnings of the securitiesrelated aoci should accrete back to equity by the end of during the quarter we completed million in share repurchases which reduced our share count by million shares as we assess our capital priorities we continue to believe that is an appropriate nearterm operating level moving to our current outlook we anticipate continued growth in nii and nim during the fourth quarter with nii up sequentially reflecting the impact of lower deposit rates and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing partially offset by the decrease in yield from our floating rate loan portfolio this outlook assumes a 25basispoint fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 cut in november and a 50basispoint cut in december we would not expect any change to this outlook if fewer rate cuts were to occur we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up from the third quarter with middle market and auto production offsetting mixed demand in the other asset classes fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income is anticipated to rise to compared to the strong third quarter largely due to a continued rebound in capital markets revenue and continued growth in commercial payments additionally we expect fourth quarter tra revenue to be million down from million in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses are expected to be stable compared to the third quarter as the increases in revenuebased compensation and the investments in branches and technology are largely offset by efficiencies achieved in other areas fourth quarter net chargeoffs are projected to be similar or slightly down from the third quarter given the expected increase in loans during the fourth quarter we anticipate an acl build of million to million assuming no major change to the economic outlook we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and a yearoveryear basis and our ppnr guidance for the full year remains in line with our guidance from back in january our net interest income trajectory exiting the year continues to position us for record results in assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes finally moving to capital with our consistent and strong earnings we now expect to increase our share repurchases in the fourth quarter to million with potential further repurchases depending on the level of loan growth throughout the quarter in summary with our wellpositioned balance sheet growing revenue streams and disciplined expense and credit risk management we are set to generate strong and stable capital accretion top quartile profitability and long term value for shareholders customers communities and employees with that let me turn it over to matt to open the call up for qa matt curoe senior directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks bryan before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions thank you your first question comes from the line of scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the call bryan i was hoping you hey i was hoping you might be able to discuss sort of just the main puts and takes you see in the fourth quarter nii guide in particular curious about how youre thinking about the further trajectory of deposit betas and sort of how that evolves over time given that youve been very transparent about it and have an optimistic outlook there as well bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely we continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the nii as well as the performance on the deposit front and as you know weve spent a lot of time being prepared for this point in the cycle and things are playing out basically as we expected when we look at both our results and peer results the natural transition that you would expect is brokered deposits wholesale funding borrowings to start to come down thats what were seeing at the scene play out and then also then to start to see when that has been fully realized that movement in the beta and thats exactly what were seeing from us and the competition for us billion of the index deposits we were able to get the beta out of those as expected todate were about in the mid in terms of the betas that weve achieved since the 50basispoint rate cut and we still have billion billion of cds that will be approaching maturities about of our cd portfolio matures between now and the end of the first quarter as well as some additional promos that well see maturities on and well continue to grind through the deposit cost in other areas of the book so continue to feel really good about that as the trajectory plays out and then the fixed rate asset repricing and that benefit continues to be a sequential tailwind for us and thats going to continue into the fourth quarter and next year and that will be a big driver of the increase in nii from here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you maybe looking at it a little further i know youve discussed generating record nii in would love to hear any updated thoughts there i guess including what kind of lending rebound might be required to achieve that it sounded like maybe a bit more optimistic on what lending demand might look like given some of the signs of life you referred to in your opening remarks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah we are we are seeing some more activity there we dont need heroic loan growth to deliver record nii how the nii is delivered is obviously going to be very environment dependent so shape of the curve is going to matter we do expect to start to see some tailwinds on the loan growth side given what weve seen the decreases from a commercial perspective we think for the most part are behind us and were seeing nice tailwinds in the consumer businesses that will be a big driver of how we transition into the loan growth from fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 here so we would like to see a little bit of loan growth that certainly would be helpful in terms of delivering that record nii but we feel good about the trajectory from here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got you perfect all right thank you very much bryan operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi bryan timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys i posed this question to one of your peers yesterday and when i framed it out part of the response was it was a rosy outlook so ill give that as a caveat to you but can you share with us im curious and were not im not asking for a specific guidance but if the fed continues with dropping rates the way they appear to be in terms of the forward curve and their own outlook and we actually go from an inverted yield curve that weve lived with for over two years now to a positively sloping curve where the front end drops to the long end stays around to can you share with us what kind of impact that may have on your net interest income growth for bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah obviously gerard well give more detail next year on but if we can actually get a little bit more steepness in the curve get the inversion out of the curve that is very powerful for us from an nii perspective from here because we would expect to see some relief on the liability side of the balance sheet we do continue to have confidence that we would get costs out and the thing thats not reflected in our forward guidance right now is an assumption that were going to be able to maintain the fixed rate asset spreads we do assume that there is compression as rates come down and if we were to get to a normalshaped curve there would be even more benefit then from the fixed rate asset repricing and we would also have a little bit of opportunity to get some a little bit more economics out of duration in the security portfolio and then the swap portfolio over time so thatd be a really productive environment for us and we would see it over time you would see a significant expansion moving forward timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp and at least for what its worth gerard i dont know that i see your outlook as being overly rosy in that regard i just think its probably a reflection of what both the feds actions and the data would tell us is realistic it probably feels rosy because we just havent seen an environment like that over a very long time in a very long time period probably years or something like that right either we had absolute rates at zero on the front end and fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 a little bit of slope or weve had this situation now where the front end was elevated and you had a historic level of inversion without a recession if the fed manages to land the plane here the front end comes down i think our view has been that the 10year was probably going to be stickier just youre talking about on an intermediateterm basis inherently more inflationary dynamics including the domestic manufacturing industrial policy the green energy transition the historic level of fiscal deficits that were running like those are all things that should work against the long end of the curve moving meaningfully lower and potentially even you could see if the fed settles out at the or the long end of the curve move up a little bit so you get more of a normal term premium that sort of an environment if it doesnt come along with some other issue would be a really wonderful one for the balance sheet portion of our revenue gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then can you guys remind us you talked about lifting up the buyback a bit in the fourth quarter bryan you talked about how the tangible book value accretion how its going to come through just the burn off of that in the securities portfolio through the end of can you remind us in an environment where you know what the basel iii end game requirements are which hopefully we will obviously by this time next year what should we expect in terms of how much of the capital that you guys are comfortable giving back to shareholders as a percentage of earnings for example in dividends and buybacks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah our target right now in a normalized environment we like being in say a to range from a dividend payout ratio perspective the share buyback ultimately is driven by how much capacity we have relative to organic growth because we do our preference would be to continue to invest on the organic front when we see good riskadjusted returns and then with whats left we manage capital via the share buybacks we continue to feel good with the capital generation that weve been seeing that million or million of share buyback feel about the right level this quarter we saw a little bit of benefit in rwa which allows us to potentially have a little bit more share buyback but with some loan growth coming in next year hopefully well be talking about a little bit lower buyback over time just because weve got a lot more organic opportunities to invest in gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you guys timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo of wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 hey just to follow up on the you said the loan production is the highest in five quarters and then quarterover quarter loan growth is flat right so if you could just give a little bit more detail like how much would loans have grown without pay downs and why arent you seeing more of this it sounds like you said theres signs of life but is it bigger than a breadbox sort of what you think might come ahead thanks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah thanks mike the pay downs for the quarter were around say million a bit elevated from what we would typically see in some of the portfolios as well as we had a utilization headwind of about because we did see the revolver utilization move down that decrease is another say million so the combination of those two were a decent driver ultimately from a overall average loan growth and endofperiod loan growth perspective were not expecting continued pressures at this point and weve seen utilization stabilize in the second half of the quarter and in the beginning of this quarter so that doesnt feel like a headwind for us right now the capital markets activity obviously it was a very robust capital markets activity in the third quarter we do think that fed into some of the pay down behaviors that were seeing but from here were expecting to get back to a little bit more normalized level and we think that helps then with loan growth from here mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and as far as if you had to pencil in kind of expectations for the next several quarters or over the next year are you willing to give us any number yet you think itll be more than or or i mean im sure youre going to your bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i mean we gave average loan growth guide obviously of up sequentially well get into in more detail next year but in general our objective would be to grow with the market plus point or points historically the banking industry grows in line with gdp nominal gdptype levels and if we get back to that kind of environment and the industry gets back to overall aggregate growth we would expect to be in line if not outperform the industry timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah i think mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks yeah timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp mike its tim look one thing maybe id add here i am of the view that the factors that would lead to a more favorable environment for loan growth inside the banking system are potentially in front of us subject to one who fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 wins the election and probably more importantly what of the things that both candidates are campaigning on actually make their way into policy and how they elect to govern what we hear from clients when im out in the field is that its one the elevated level of rates have been challenging because theres capital investments that dont make sense that just dont pencil out in an environment where rates are higher two because they are uncertain about what were going to see in the election they have been using cash flow from the businesses to pay down debt in lieu of investing it in other places and three you have this big build up in inventory at the timeframe associated with people moving i think we referred to it as the shift from just in time to just in case in inventories as rates came up we have seen i think the term for it that one of our distribution clients our wholesale distribution clients use when i was out with them last week was destocking so less inventory less building material across supply chains which in turn and a focus on more inventory turns just getting the balance sheet to work harder which reduces the revolving credit borrowing needs that cant go to zero so youre not going to have a headwind there if interest rates come down and more ma and capital investment starts to make sense that hasnt worked you should see a pickup on that front and then if we continue to see more certainty as it relates to the trajectory of the economy and have the uncertainty attached to the election out of the equation i think we could see a better environment across the banking system and that coupled with the sales head counts that we continue to make we referenced that in the prepared remarks should support the attoabove market growth rate on the lending side of the equation that bryan referenced earlier mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just a couple of followups one maybe starting with loan growth tim you mentioned two things one from a fifth third standpoint are we still lapping derisking or running off the shared national credit book i think its down yearoveryear just give us your sense of is that book going to continue to decline as you kind of reduce your exposure there and secondly in your business are you seeing any competition from nonbank direct lenders private credit that looks different today than it would have three four five years ago fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah sure good question so we should be at the inflection point on the sort of impact of the rwa diet by the end of the year i think we talked last year about the fact that we were trying to get everything done in the fourth quarter there would be a little bit of a spill over into the first as you just got through normal timing but we should be reaching the inflection point on that front where you dont have the less derisking ebrahim than a focus on what would the profitability the unit economics of those relationships look like in a world where you had different perspective on capital levels and the value of the corporate cash that comes along with some of those larger relationships as it relates to private credit like we do see it at the margins principally in leveraged lending space what i would tell you has happened is theyre focus on less structure faster execution then has a little bit of a bleed over in other areas and there is no question that things that some of the private lenders are willing to do are not in line with the way that we want to run our portfolio i think it was the financial times or the journal but there was a piece about a week ago in the paper that talked about payment in kind or where i come from negative amortization lending was between a quarter and a third of the portfolios at most of the major private credit shops that is definitely not something you would ever see at fifth third in an environment where the economic backdrop is benign and where you dont have a large percentage of your companies operating at distressed levels its just odd to see that amount of pik lending going on so theyre willing to do those things and were not by definition theyre going to scrape the most indebted companies out of the banking sector bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and ebrahim this is bryan we put a little bit of detail on the snc portfolio on slide of our slide and we have billion portfolio its down yearoveryear so we are still facing lapping some of that headwind ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc but was the point that we had at a point where that billion is close to where this book should bottom out bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i think youre going to continue to see some runoff but we do think were getting back to the point where youll start to see some production coming in and offsetting it it may not be exactly at the floor but the decreases should definitely be moderating timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp the cib pipeline the middle market pipeline which i think we referenced in response to mikes question is at an alltimerecord level and the cib pipeline which would be where the majority of the shared national credits would originate is at the highest level it has been in the year so youre seeing the turn there which should support the decline in runoff increase in production and an inflection point in loan balances fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 ebrahim h q poonawala analyst bofa securities inc and just the other question on capital allocation means your stocks done well im not saying its expensive but it stayed well on tangible book when you look at it why not hold excess capital as opposed to picking up the pace of buybacks given that we might be in an improving economy if that happens more capital good for growth if its worse it adds defensibility just talk through in terms of how you go through capital allocation and the whole discussion or analysis around holding on and building some more excess dry powder as opposed to accelerating buybacks from here bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i mean feel really good indiscernible about the earnings trajectory of the company and we think given that we feel like our stock is it continues to be a good bargain for us and we think its a good investment for us from a corporate perspective we look at a couple of things on that front were generating a lot of capital every quarter and so that actually gives us the ability to be very dynamic with our capital allocation decision we have a lot of confidence that were going to be able to generate the capital necessary for organic growth and then if we wanted to slow down capital distribution via share buybacks because we see more opportunity or we need to get more defensive we would be able to do that another component is just when you think about our industry and the cost of equity sitting on excess capital is a high cost for our shareholders and so being in a position as we are right now and being able to go ahead and make some decisions and deploy at a time where we continue to feel really positive about our trajectory as a company and knowing that we have the flexibility with the income profile and the stability that we have going forward to generate the capital when we would need to and if we think different opportunities would present themselves thats really the thought process on how were thinking about capital allocation from here ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is for you bryan so you indicated that your deposit beta so far on the recent cuts are in the mid as we think about the speed of index deposit repricing and then retail could you give us a sense of what fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 you think the cadence could be as we go through the next five quarters so a few of your peers have noted that it might not be a straight line path to the terminal beta given how quickly corporate can reprice and retail sort of been awoken so to speak in terms of higher rates so if you could speak to that and maybe speak a little bit to as you think about your indiscernible deposits we havent seen a neutral rate thats not zero for so long so maybe help us get a sense of if we get a neutral rate of or what do you think your natural spread is or natural deposit rate is in that environment bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i mean that is obviously a very interesting question the shape of the curve is going to matter a lot in that scenario as well when we think about the pacing of how the beta will come through like you said it is the commercial deposits will come through very quickly the retail takes a little bit longer the two primary drivers for us on that its the guarantee periods on the promotional offerings which tend to be between say and days and then its the maturities of your cd portfolio as i mentioned earlier of our cds will mature between now and the end of the first quarter so to get the rest of the beta and get to that kind of cumulative beta that we have been targeting where in the high kind of beta for us it will take about two quarters because the cd repricing is going to be a component of that now thats billion in the book from a natural level perspective i think that is really tough to estimate i mean were sitting here at peak rates we were at a 299ish was our peak interestbearing core deposit costs versus fed funds level we would expect to see a little bit of compression potentially in that spread but being able to maintain basis points to basis points of deposit spread seems like a potentially achievable scenario one big question on that erika another one that would obviously be a big question is just where does how does the magnitude of loan growth change over time and if youve got a decent curve shape back to gerards question and youve got opportunities for loan growth youre going to have some opportunities to be a little bit more competitive to raise more deposits and ultimately drive better nii and at the end of the day were not managing the deposit betas were managing the nii and profitability trajectory and those are the decisions and the tradeoffs well make erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for tim tim the feedback from investors has always been quite positive in terms of the forwardlooking way of how you look at the world and as we think about i guess it doesnt it feels like given record nii and your fee income should benefit if activity levels come back in general in an even bigger way next year it feels like the expense run rate that you posted yearoveryear this quarter the it feels more appropriate obviously assuming that revenue grow above that as we think about is it right for us to until we get guides when you put growth and expenses as a placeholder and as we think about what are the big projects that you feel like youre ready to retackle and revisit that you may have pulled back on in because the nii dollars were coming down timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes so thank you i think there was a compliment and a question in there and i appreciate both youve heard me reference i think the old saying that cincinnati invented hustle in the past that dates back to pete roses nickname and the fact that he sprinted to first base on a walk i think that ethos is i think a part of the way that fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 we try to run the company right is to sprint to first on a walk so we try to work on next years problems and the year after that this year as opposed to waiting for that environment to materialize and part of why i think we made the nim turn right our nim trough and then grew in the first quarter before most of our peers the nii inflected positive in the second quarter over the first quarter which was before most of the peers we got to real sequential positive operating leverage this quarter versus the last quarter and were saying well get there yearoveryear next year but none of that involved us holding back on investments we thought were important to the company or would make sense right were going to have built 30plus branches this year in an environment where we were trying to manage expenses we continued forward on the platform modernization the acquisitions we made on the commercial payments side of fintech companies last year weve continued to feed this year and the hiring as i mentioned on the sales force both in wealth management and in the middle market had been pretty significant so you should expect us to do the same sorts of things next year and to expect the company through other efficiency initiatives to help selffund the investments along the way and we dont view strategic planning as an investment request process its principally a resource allocation process so i dont know that i helped you with a specific number for you have to wait till january to get that but the annualized expense run rate of the bank over a period of time has been call it if you look at it so that certainly if you were going to use the past averaged through more benign periods and more challenging periods would be where youd start erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks so much timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp absolutely operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia of morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to ask about index deposits can you talk about how theyve behaved over time so i guess the question is that as rates fall and the rates on those index deposits fall is there a chance that some of those move into other deposit products with exception pricing or does that not really happen based on historical experience bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp well youll see some people that try to do some negotiations on deposit costs those are things that always occur but those are things that we are typically able to manage fairly well the reality is you get paid a better spread as a depositor on an index deposit because youre taking the risk ultimately on market movements whereas on a managed account its typically a wider spread because we have more ability to manage it so its something that weve had good experience with behaving controlling it through our pricing and through our fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 discipline around that process were not overly concerned about reverse migration from index back into mandatory being a headwind from a beta perspective manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe just separately on credit on slide youre showing ncos and npas reaching normalized levels i mean i know you noted that youre not seeing any signs of credit weakening can you give us some more color there what gives you some confidence that things are just normalizing here is it that rates are going down so that helps you on the credit side is it just what youre seeing on the rolled rates maybe what helps this to stabilize from here greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah its greg ill take that one a couple of things look at our delinquencies and delinquencies continue to be at alltimelow levels our criticized assets actually went down by million quarteroverquarter we had the increase in npas on the commercial side those were driven by five names in five different industries weve been very consistent in talking about a very diverse portfolio and it continues to be very diverse on the consumer side were seeing a little bit of softness on dividend see a little bit of softness in the rv portfolio when you look at the origination vintages theyre underperforming across many of the consumer asset classes we see the same thing in the portfolio specifically in dividend and rv but the securitization data from other originators would tell you the same thing were actually outperforming those indexes that securitization data by almost basis points and so i would expect dividend to be a little bit elevated for the next quarter or two but im highly confident that we will work through those vintages and it comes back down to a more normalized level in that level so were just not seeing anything within the portfolios commercial or consumer thats causing additional concern its been pretty stable our borrowers have continued to behave youve seen these commercial real estate portfolio weve got virtually no delinquencies very very minimal nonperforming assets in that commercial real estate portfolio so across the board that diversification that strategic play of building out a throughthecycle portfolio has played well for us and i would expect that to continue in the future manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning on slide youve got some pie charts here you showed before just showing the mix shift from the midwest to being more balanced and i guess the question is as we look out in the next few years you show the split getting to which is still a pretty meaningful reshift from here so how do you get there is it simply harvesting what youve done a combination of harvesting and building is there a buy component of that as well fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah theres no buy component in there thats the oldfashioned way which is one new branch at a time and the right marketing and product strategies to support the increase in distribution so if you look at the branches weve built matt theyre performing very well weve talked in the past about the fact that the performance at this stage and having built more than of them is pretty predictable and they reach a point where they sort of saturate their catchment area in about seven years right they breakeven within two and then they make this pivot to continuing growth so the average age of the de novo right now is going to be like call it two years twoandahalf years at the most so there is a fiveyear tailwind well get from the that are already in the ground and operational plus we have been building about to a year that number should move up into the sort of to range on an annualized basis just based on what we have in the pipeline and as those branches come online you will see that mix shift play out first in the allocation of the physical distribution and then behind that over time as they mature the mix of the deposit base on the retail side overall matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so thats super helpful so a lot of maturing of what youve already done will move the needle quite a bit timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp it will matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just separately timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp you can see it in the yearoveryear retail deposit growth that i cited from the fdic summary and deposits its visible there matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you and then just separately i know theres been a lot of discussion on net interest income and kind of drivers of the nim and im sorry if i missed it but have you guys talked about this concept of like normalized nim looking out a few years as you get the fixed rate asset repricing and whatever rates to break the forward curve any concept of normalized nim bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i mean its again its another tough one because what does the environment look like what does the shape of the curve look like out in the future if you just take the cash position that were holding today were north of billion of cash were up almost billion yearoveryear every billion of excess cash that were fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 holding is a basis points on nim so just getting billion out over the next year and hopefully having some opportunities to deploy that into the loan portfolio that could add to basis points to our nim alone were going to see nim grow from here just with the continued repricing of the portfolio from a fixed rate asset perspective that will continue to take that just takes a little bit more time to play out but if you get a little bit of relief on the front end or a more normalized curve get the front end down i mean its not unreasonable to think we could be talking about getting back to what was a to nim in a reasonable time horizon matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning i wanted to ask about some of the large banks who have been placed under regulatory orders this year does that create new business opportunities for you beyond your already organic pipeline timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp i mean i think any time theres a limit on someone elses ability to grow it means that the rest of the industry has to have the capacity to be able to absorb the growth in the market so i guess in that sense yes just tactically i think more strategically the more disciplined you are about the way you run your business the better you do in moments when theres any sort of disruption somewhere else right so i wouldnt wish significant regulatory problems on anybody theyre no fun to work through but they do tend to create opportunities at the margins for other banks that are in a strong position and have the ability to grow in an environment where others may not christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great tim thank you for that and just a quick followup on sort of asset returns over time does lower interest rates help you get your returns or does it make it more challenging bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp lower interest rates as long as that comes along with a normalization of the yield curve would certainly be very helpful to returns over time a low flat curve is a challenging environment for the banking system christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you bryan appreciate it everybody operator we have a followup question from the line of mike mayo of wells fargo securities your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey i was just wondering this is a big picture question you guys give the sense that youre investing more for growth than others do you have any metric on how much you make in your organic investments and what sort of returns you get on those im thinking about the southeast branches or wealth or commercial payments and it kind of goes back at our earlier question maybe you shouldnt buy back so much stock if you have so many opportunities for growth or high class problem if you get there timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah i mean we look at all of these things the easiest comparable across the different investment types is probably just irr mike right and time to breakeven so the irr of the branches in the southeast has been running in the to range and the time to breakeven has been a couple of years right if you were to look at the small acquisitions weve made to support commercial payments we were targeting irrs in the in those cases in part because you had a more nascent business and its less predictable after then when you built branches and you know what youre going to get out of the next location that you build so in general we feel really good about anything that we can get done in that sort of to range subject to the execution risk thats attached the more uncertain the more nascent the strategy the higher the return you would expect to get out of it and the more proven strategies obviously the lower the execution risk premium that you would need to place on them i dont think we are constraining the investment rate like if you just look at the southeast jpmorgan has built the most branches down there over the course of the past five years theyre at or something like that i think fifth third is number two and i believe bofa is number three and then theres a pretty wide gap between that and everybody else and i know i dont have to tell you that were a little bit smaller than bofa and jpmorgan so we are we think being appropriately aggressive in terms of the investment rate down there and at least at the moment i dont know that if we said hey were not going to buy back stock we dont have an alternative use for that capital on an organic basis that we would be thinking that we would deploy it toward bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah mike we are accelerating the investments as tim mentioned on the proven strategies its part of why were going from what was to branches over a year to 50plus branch over a year so we have more confidence that gives us a point of view of an area we want to invest in and then the other limiter for us is always going to be the analysts that are worried about positive operating leverage because thats the tradeoff we care about as well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just to push back on that last point i mean i hear you if you get those sorts of irr and youre accelerating your branch build but this come at a time when i think some of the southeast competitors have woken up recovered like you less unrealized securities losses going from defense to offense so you have that change versus the last few years and you also have the likes of some of those big banks that you mentioned spending so much more in technology and digital so dont you think it might be tougher in the next few years than its been in the past few years fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp oh i dont know i dont think that the southeast was uncompetitive the last five years right i think what youre just youre constantly looking at is are we making the right set of investments given the competitors that we have and our value proposition relative to others i completely agree the amount of money that is getting deployed into technology investment on the part of the large banks is eye popping but if you look at the value proposition like go pull up the lead consumer checking account offering for any of those large banks and for fifth third or some other regional and tell me how that materialized into some substantially better value proposition i actually think in many cases what you would see is the opposite is its been the regionals who led on consumerfriendly product innovation its definitely been true of fifth third but its not just been fifth third in terms of the offerings there so we are not running the bank to be able to take share in uncompetitive environments we run the bank to be able to take share in very competitive environments and i expect the level of competition is going to stay high not that its going to get better or for that matter get worse mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah thank you operator that concludes our qa session i will now turn the conference back over to matt for closing remarks matt curoe senior directorinvestor relations
