wintrust financial corp thank you very much welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call as mentioned with me are dave dykstra dave stoehr kate boege tim crane and rich murphy we have the same format as we ph instituted earlier this year im going to give some general comments regarding our results go over to tim crane for more detail on the balance sheet and to dave dykstra for other income and other expense and rich murphy will discuss credit back to me for some summary comments and thoughts on the future and then time for questions on the overview all in all very successful quarter i could almost give the same comments made at the end of q2 at the end of last april at the start of the pandemic and the governments massive response to it ph i indicated wintrust support was going to attempt to grow through it today weve accomplished this goal and as such the quarter shows the strategy is working all our growth today has been organic second quarter was another all around billion quarter assets deposits core loans net of ppp loans all grew by over billion both price mix remain very good of particular note ph core loan growth result in overall increase in total loans for the quarter even after ppp runoff we were able to achieve another billion loan quarter in q4 which we believe is more than a reasonable assumption given our pipelines which by the way are a 13month high at quarterend ph we will fully replace all the ppp balances this is our intent before we embarked on the strategy net income for the quarter was million or per diluted common share yeartodate we said million or per share reported net interest margin decreased basis points to primarily due to excess liquidity net interest income was up million from quarter two ph if you back out the ppp loan income and total net interest income was up almost million over quarter two period end loans exceeded average loans of the quarter by ph million which bodes well for q4 our liquidity portfolio is up billion on average indiscernible very short remains very short over billion overhead money at the fed investing this money ph is wage rise is a lever we can pull when the time is right indiscernible business as our current pipelines ph line usage remains low a little over is up around from the end of quarter two indiscernible hopefully hit bottom ph on this thing and the line usage started to increase indiscernible close to return to normal to add another billion in outstanding loans credit quality indiscernible chargeoffs totaling like net zero we had some chargeoffs but we had recoveries which shows should indicate indiscernible good on recovery npls and nps were constant versus q2 npls was million to million or basis points while ph npas shrunk million at basis points this plus improved portfolio quality indiscernible overall economy indiscernible million mortgage increased experienced some growth in the quarter dave will discuss in detail indiscernible steady improvement fees of million quartertoquarter up million yeartodate ill turn the call over to tim whos going to provide indiscernible detail on the balance sheet tim timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 good thanks ed id like to briefly highlight a few balance sheet items as well as cover two topics that appear to be of interest first with respect to the balance sheet total assets increased to just under billion as we continue to experience strong growth as ed mentioned loans excluding ppp grew billion during the quarter essentially mirroring last quarters growth the growth was spread across virtually all loan categories as rich will discuss in a few minutes on a percentage basis this is the second straight quarter where annualized loan growth again excluding ppp was approximately with respect to ppp loans we saw a reduction of approximately million during the quarter at this point almost all of the ppp loans originated in have been forgiven and approximately half of the loans from either have been or are in the process of being forgiven by yearend we project the remaining ppp balances will be down materially and the remaining the income impact to be relatively small for the remainder of the year we are comfortable with our loan growth target of mid to highsingle digits on a percentage basis again rich will provide some additional color on loan pipelines and the factors that would drive potential upside to that number deposit growth for the quarter was also strong billion almost all of it either dda or low cost deposits this is an annualized growth rate of approximately despite the high levels of ppp forgiveness we are not seeing unusual volatility in customer deposits this quarter the interestbearing deposit cost fell another basis points to basis points this is largely a function of cd repricing deposit costs will continue to decline but a slower pace in coming quarters as weve noted in prior periods we continue to monitor the deposit growth carefully given the high levels of liquidity in the market however we view stable low cost deposits as a strength of the company and well continue to pursue deposits related to client relationships on the investment front we remain very liquid during the quarter our securities balances were up slightly as we replaced investments maturing but generally have not yet moved to deploy the large amounts of excess liquidity as we remain wary of locking in low longterm yields as the market continues to trend up we will evaluate our position and view appropriate deployment of this liquidity if theres an opportunity in future periods to improve the margin and income our capital levels remain appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank you will note that during the quarter we repurchased approximately million worth of stock at just over per share given where we believe volumes and yields will land we continue to expect that despite lower ppp accretion net interest income will increase as it has for four consecutive quarters and that excluding ppp the margin will remain roughly stable i have two other brief comments that relate to new slides in the earnings release presentation the first has to do with digital adoption youll see on page of the presentation that our high touch community banking model also has a high tech component and that we are seeing the same increases in digital adoption and usage that some larger banks have reported we continue to upgrade our digital capabilities to give clients options on how they would like to be served these capabilities position us to compete successfully and in some cases to differentiate ourselves versus our competitors currently youll see that a full twothirds of our checking clients regularly use our digital services page in the presentation document is also a new slide relates to the customer satisfaction of our commercial clients in this case the source is greenwich data sic coalition greenwich and as you can see wintrust is top ranked across a host of important categories to scale this for you the overall satisfaction score wintrust achieved compares generally to scores in the and for many of our competitors the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 service we provide increases the depth of our relationships and is the foundation for our strong momentum in the illinois and wisconsin markets as well as nationally in many of our niche businesses with that ill turn it over to dave david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim as ed mentioned ill cover the income statement categories starting with the net interest income for the third quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million compared to the second quarter and an increase of million sic million as compared to the third quarter of last year the million increase in net interest income compared to the second quarter was primarily due to average earning asset growth which was up on an annualized basis by over the prior quarter and one additional day in the third quarter which was offset somewhat by a slightly compressed net interest margins net interest margin declined basis points to the beneficial decline of basis points for the rates paid on liabilities was offset by a 10basispoint decline on the yield on our average earning assets and a basis point decline in the net free funds contribution which resulted in a slight decline in the net interest margin the decline in the earning assets in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the impact of building shortterm liquid assets the decrease in the rate paid on net interestbearing liabilities as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interestbearing deposits primarily due to the repricing of time deposits i think its important to note that the net interest income expanded despite million of less interest income associated with the ppp loan portfolio in the third quarter which included million of lower ppp loan fee accretion and as ed mentioned our net interest margin excluding the ppp portfolio was relatively stable as it declined by only basis point turning to the provision for credit losses like many other banks have done this quarter wintrust again recorded a negative provision for credit losses of million that compared to a directionally similar negative provision of million in the prior quarter and a million provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter the negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to improvements in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including decreases in net chargeoffs and covidrelated loan modifications and improving loan risk rating migration rich will cover credit quality in additional detail in just a few minutes i will now talk about the noninterest income on noninterest expense and income tax sections in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue increased to another record level of million in the third quarter compared to million in the second quarter and that revenue was up from a million recorded in the year ago quarter the revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing on a portion of our managed asset accounts mortgage banking revenue saw a ph reasonable solid loan origination volume during the third quarter with origination activity fairly consistent with the second quarter of this year to that end the company originated billion of loan mortgage loans for sale in the third quarter of down from the approximately billion that we originated in the prior quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 as we forecasted on our last call mortgage banking revenue increased to million for the third quarter of as compared to million in the second quarter revenue was higher in the current quarter primarily due to less material unfavorable fair value adjustments on our mortgage servicing right portfolio the company recorded a million negative valuation adjustment in the second quarter as compared to a smaller decrease of in the current quarter looking forward based on market conditions and expected seasonality of home purchasing activity we anticipate mortgage originations for sale in the fourth quarter of to be down to from the origination volumes we experienced in the third quarter and mortgage revenue excluding the msr valuation adjustments to be down similarly also as we saw in the first three quarters of this year the wild card relates to mortgage banking as it relates to mortgage banking revenue is the mortgage servicing right valuation which is tied closely to mortgage interest rate movements im not going to speculate on where those rates are going to move to but our previous forecast of a reduction of to excludes any change in the msr valuation other noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter of up approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter the primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category include million of higher swap fee revenue million of higher income from investments in partnerships which are primarily related to cra purposes a positive swing of in foreign exchange valuation adjustments associated with the uscanadian dollar exchange rate of higher boli income and offsetting those increases was the fact that the prior quarter included a million gain on the sale of a few branch locations in southwestern wisconsin and there were no such similar gains in the current quarter turning to noninterest expense noninterest expenses totaled million in the third quarter up approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter therere a handful of categories that ill address that comprise the majority of that net increase salaries and employee benefits expenses actually declined by million in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of this year the million decline is primarily related to million of lower compensation expense associated with the mortgage banking operation offset somewhat by higher incentive compensation expenses for annual bonus and longterm incentive compensation plans advertising and marketing expense totaled million in the third quarter an increase of million compared to the second quarter of the increase in the third quarter relates primarily to increased sponsorship activity for the summer months including our major and minor league baseball sponsorships and more community events occurring we would expect this expense level to decline in the fourth quarter as many of these sponsorships are geared towards the summer months software and equipment expense totaled million in the third quarter an increase of million as compared to the second quarter total of million the increase is due to increased expenses associated with upgrading our data centers for increased capacity scalability and reliability other network upgrades to support our growth and ongoing digital enhancements and various other software upgrades as weve done over the last few years we continue to invest in software and technology to enhance our customer experience and delivery systems and products ph as well as investment systems to support our growth and as tim mentioned our customer satisfaction results are great and so i think the investment in those systems is paying dividends wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 oreo expenses were actually negative by approximately million in the third quarter as the company recorded gains of approximately million from the sale of oreo properties these gains were an amount that exceeded the aggregate cost of oreo expenses and valuation charges on other oreo properties the miscellaneous expense category totaled million in the third quarter compared to million in the second quarter of this year its an increase of million the increase was primarily impacted by approximately million of more travel and entertainment expenses and a variety of other smaller fluctuations the increase in the travel and entertainment expense category was due to increased costs associated with in person client relationship meetings and conferences as well as some additional expense associated with an all employee event to celebrate wintrusts 30th anniversary and to thank our employees for performing quite well during the pandemic although this expense category is higher in recent quarters theyre still lower than the general run rate we had in prior periods before the pandemic began and were encouraged to see our team returning to more normal inperson events to build and maintain solid customer relationships this activity is important to maintaining the strong loan growth weve been achieving in recent quarters so other than those expense categories i just discussed all other expense categories in the aggregate were up by less than million compared to the second quarter and nothing of significance to discuss there the net overhead ratio a measure of our operational efficiency improved in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter the net overhead ratio stood at which is down basis points from the recorded in the second quarter the ratio continues to benefit from strong balance sheet growth and good mortgage banking results our current target assuming relatively normal mortgage activity is for the net overhead ratio to stay below due to the strong balance sheet growth and the focus on expense control relative to revenue growth i should note that the efficiency ratio also improved in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter the efficiency ratio stood at in the third quarter a decline of basis points from the prior quarter moving on to income tax expense the effective tax rate was relatively stable at approximately which is in the range that we would consider normal in summary core fundamentals were strong with robust loan and deposit growth and increased net interest income despite significant ppp loan reductions record wealth management revenue strong mortgage revenue improved net overhead and efficiency ratios strong pipelines and very good credit quality so with that summary ill conclude my comments and turn it over to rich richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the second quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter net of ppp was billion or annualized well above our guidance equally as important was the nature of this growth which was spread across our loan portfolio specifically ci loans were up million cre loans which were up million wintrust life which was up million and first insurance funding which was up million throughout the pandemic we have seen solid and consistent loan growth if you look at q3 compared to q3 we have seen total loans net of ppp grow by billion or on our last earnings call we expressed confidence in our ability to continue to meet or exceed our loan growth guidance because of the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 strength of our core loan pipeline we believe this momentum is attributable to a number of factors the ppp halo effect which is really taking hold on the level of commercial loans we have seen substantial expansion in the numbers and amounts of treasury management relationships over the past several quarters but it takes time to move the entirety of the credit relationship out of the incumbent bank we are now seeing those effects result in outstandings market disruption has been pronounced throughout this year and throughout the pandemic and we have seen customers and bankers look to wintrust as a consistent and preferred banking partner in chicago and southern wisconsin as a result pipelines continue to look very strong and at the highest levels weve seen in several years finally as detailed on slide after five quarters of decreased ci line utilization the trend is beginning to reverse as noted in earlier calls this utilization has been historically close to we saw this level bottom out in q2 at and we ended q3 at we believe this trend of increased usage will continue in the fourth quarter as discussed in prior quarters one of the keys to the performance and growth of our credit portfolio has been diversification across a number of product lines this quarter was another great example of that strategy our niche products particularly premium finance and leasing grew substantially during the pandemic now we are beginning to see very strong growth coming from our core banking customers in addition slide details the geographic diversification in our portfolio as we have stated before wintrust has a chicagomilwaukee nexus however as this slide illustrates our various business lines provide us with meaningful amount of credit opportunities outside of these primary markets from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see solid credit performance across the portfolio as the economy stabilizes this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans remained flat and are approximately million or basis points npls continue to be at record low levels and roughly half of where those were at this time last year chargeoffs for the quarter were essentially zero an amazing result especially when looking at total chargeoffs of approximately million for the past two quarters combined and as noted in the bottom right quadrant on page credit risk ratings continue to show meaningful positive migration as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks murph those of you who examine transcripts of our earnings calls will notice a lot of similarities between this quarter and the last indiscernible fans of consistency as i mentioned at the beginning of the call our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet during this period of low rates use our structural hedges like mortgages to buffer the loss and nii until such time as balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to lower rates ppp loans indiscernible add on to this strategy all the above was to be accomplished while enhancing our asset sensitivity position in anticipation of eventual higher interest rates ph theres some balance sheet growth that has a deposit growth of billion yeartodate and loan growth of billion excluding loans held for sale and ppp we have experienced as tim laid out that has been done totally on an organic basis wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 the acquisition market remains somewhat consistent with quarter based upon the amount of inbound calls we continue to receive some still have very high expectations so well see where this ends up loan pipelines remain strong in all major categories and i said at the beginning at a 13month high this is aided by not only our reputation but also market disruption and our diversified portfolio our asset sensitivity position is right where we want it and it appears that the indiscernible inflation is transitory is coming to an end and rate increases are inevitable the underwater beach ball will rise hopefully soon we continue to leg into investments with our excess liquidity take advantage of market blips indiscernible total investment is likely in the lousy longterm rates doesnt make a lot of sense to us credit is remarkably good thanks to our consistently conservative underwriting standards and diversified loan portfolio working both our lending line and credit folks npas npls are lower than they were before the start of the pandemic wealth management area is delivering strong results with assets under administration continuing to grow so to date the plan is working we need to continue to grow in order to bring this plan to fulfillment organic loan growth should remain strong to take advantage of the opening of the acquisition market it makes sense in short i like where we stand as mentioned or we referred to in december we will celebrate our 30th anniversary getting close to a billion bank with billion in assets under administration in our wealth management group is beyond any thought of where wed be at this point in time so we got a couple of guys in here with that original card table and i think you could pinch us if you knew how excited we were about where we are and what our prospects are going forward for the next years you can be assured our best efforts going forward we appreciate your continued support now we have time for some questions so thank you very much move on to questions question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your question please jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone or afternoon everyone morning i guess edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ph how are you arf jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah im good im good a little confused on the time but anyway i want to talk about loan growth i know edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible so what else is new wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc what eastern central i dont know but just the loan growth numbers appreciate the guidance for the fourth quarter but to murphs comments on the ppp halo market disruption line utilization i think i would throw in premium financeable market in there as well but what slows this down and what would cause you to pull back on saying you can put up this kind of growth into edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think if you see indiscernible and rationality kicks in and were starting to see some of it the bigger banks going and just giving it away because of the dearth of earning assets out there that could cause us to back off a little bit because as you know our policy and our profitability model are indiscernible and were not going to be changing those ph railing but right now we dont see it we see people coming from other banks who appreciate our longterm approach appreciate our approach to doing business i like to say a lot of them just they just thought theyre having a good time indiscernible before as tim mentioned we spent a lot of money and we do a better job of telling you how much money we spend on our technology going in the fourth quarter expect well give you a real detail of how much of our expenses relates to our technology build and winning the greenwich awards is really heartening to us because the numbers were seeing a and the like of people would recommend us that builds on itself so i dont think you can see the premium finance market change that much and tim i think its going to get harder even next year the market continues to get harder people are thinking maybe increase there additional increase in premiums on the commercial side on the life side we see some pricing rationality but we stay away from those and with whats going on with the tax laws and the like its going to make life insurance a reasonable way to plan your estate and not have to pay the exorbitant state taxes that are being proposed the commercial side murph i dont know richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah no you hit the nail on the head i think that generally speaking we like where we sit and we think that our positioning in the marketplace is very good and as we alluded to were seeing not only customers but also bankers look at as a real attractive alternative so really good core momentum there i think to your question what wrinkles are out there as ed said the challenges that you look at every one of our competitors and they are also they have a lot of cash to deploy so you are seeing pricing being very aggressive and youre seeing structures also pretty aggressive so right now we dont anticipate any type of ropeadope or anything like that but something that we are very aware of the other thing is on the life side it is because rates were so low it really was a great opportunity for people to use that product and if rates were to go up dramatically here and thats probably going to have an impact on that but right now we see ourselves being as we go into budget season were pretty optimistic about where we see indiscernible wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp leasing is good leasing is at a really good time during the pandemic anything where leasing tends to be a little bit more of a transactional business and so people are very focused on structure and pricing and so we were very mindful of that so were not going to go out there and chase deals but as youve seen jon over the course of the last three years and the way weve grown that portfolio were pretty optimistic of where its happening its probably the one area where were really focused on pricing because were if were going to lean in on pricing its going to be for a complete relationship where you get the full share of wallet jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay good color on that thank you then i guess just one on the margin appreciate the comments tim on the margins being relatively stable you alluded to the beach ball weve heard that for a long time but any threats to the margin indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah no ive heard it a lot years ago but were waiting were still waiting but what can make your margin lift and youve alluded to maybe getting a little bit more aggressive on liquidity deployment but still being careful but as we look forward to the margin it feels like its bottomed out here and maybe the only way to go is up from here but talk a little bit about the plan and can the margin lift edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well additional liquidity would cause the margin to have additional pressure but in terms of net interest income i think youre going to see that growing nicely throughout the rest of the year tim you want to comment on the timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp sure yeah i mean jon were watching pricing pretty carefully deposit costs will continue to help a little bit not as much as they have in the prior quarters and if we get rising rates here the 10year is up to ph we watch that closely and we deploy some more liquidity will help both our margin and our income were patient there so i hesitate to forecast when that might happen but we feel pretty good we remain very interestsensitive and feel like thats still an important part of the equation jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp dave you got something on here wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i was just going to say billion of that liquidity and then and deposits keep coming in so thats a good lever but i was going to also say that the new loans are sort of coming on at the existing portfolio pricing right now so you see a little bit of compression from some older loans paying off at higher rates but the new loans are coming on so i think weve stabilized on the loan side substantially and so exppp it should have like you said should have roughly bottomed out and we have the upside from the deployment so were optimistic on that front jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael young from truist securities your question please michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question i wanted to do a quick followup on just the excess liquidity that billion or so and just kind of cash basically on the balance sheet it seems like at current rates you could deploy that maybe for basis point kind of pick up over cash yields so by my math thats maybe or so of earnings to of earnings is that kind of the right way to think about it but then maybe if you could deploy that into loans instead maybe to or so david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well yeah mike i think the concept is right i mean as you said youre earning roughly basis points and yeah mortgage backs are plus or minus right now so theres your spread differential for investing the biggest question is do you want to invest long term at that rate or do you want to wait for it to go up but its pretty simple math its basis points and decide what asset class you want invested in and at what rates so on the loan it would probably be closer to so edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we think that we were showing solid growth in nii by the growth that were having i think that were kidding ourselves if we believe were not at the start or in the even in the first quarter of an inflationary cycle wages are rising i sit on a couple of boards and we talk to them and price increases are flying through theyre not going to go backwards supply chain disruption plus lack of labor is going to cause this cycle to start once it starts and gets some momentum its hard to stop you stop it by higher rates the government has to taper eventually in which case because of our deposit base at a higher rate and the lower rates youre playing like in the red zone higher rates youre going to get normal spreads anyhow so to lock in long term at although it could make us money now but hurt us down the road so we look at we take a longterm view and theres also the possibility that at the end of the year people start moving money out theres so much money out there they move it out hopefully theyll keep it in the bank you never know where its going to go we have to keep a little bit of excess liquidity because of that i think wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 so its really unprecedented times in terms of the liquidity side of the equation but theyre not impressive in terms of the inflationary cycle were starting to see start and this you cant fight the economics of it all you can try to say its new economics what are you going to do were old school guys and we believe that id rather lock in at or and the way up than at right now because of our deposit base being very retail and well just retail nature of the deposit base and the all could come basically 90someodd percent is all core of deposits we can lag on the way up and we can make a lot more money then so weve taken a longterm measured approach on this we could drop it in and make another a share a couple of dollars a share take over time but i dont think thats prudent to do given that we think that down the road make a lot of more money to the company and for the shareholders michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for all that color and just kind of my followup question you segued it nicely into just inflation its been a long time since weve seen material inflation and just curious kind of your high level thoughts maybe on inflation and then how that could affect the expense base and kind of growth there edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well i think the government wants inflation theyve got all the money theyre borrowing they want to pay back in cheaper dollars so weve seen the movie and kind of think its not going to have a different ending i think its going to be there for a period of time i think the cycle has started its hard to stop the cycle without raising rates and slowing things down a bit kind of in a conundrum because of the were not out of the pandemic yet supply chain issues are causing some of this i dont think theyll be over by the end of next year according to some of the boards im on and the manufacturing im talking to between those and force majeure everything else going on its tough out there for our clients and labor is tough they have to pay a lot more money to get people in the house transportation is tough out there right now you can be a truck driver and make a year and some of the offerings that are out there now so i think inflation is here and its going to stay and we have to be ready for it and when you have inflation you have to make more money than you did before just to save it right so thats our plan thats what were doing were sticking to it and i just think ive seen the movie i cant tell its going to end any differently michael young q analyst truist securities inc and dave maybe any thoughts on your expense base specifically and how that all affect kind of our outlook for or kind of expense growth david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i think id look at it michael is that if the inflation really kicks into the expense base and rates rise the increase in the margins going to more than offset the expenses and our efficiency ratio will get better and our net operating ratios et cetera will actually probably get better because of the growth in the assets and the growth in the margins so yeah our biggest cost is labor cost so we just if you see increases in labor costs then well have that go up but the rest of them we should be able to control reasonably well but i just think the margin will expand dramatically more than the expenses if inflation does kick in wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens your question please terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good afternoon edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good thank you maybe id start with ph table your interest rate sensitivity im just wondering how your underlying deposit betas maybe have changed this cycle versus the past and when i look at the loan to deposit ratio and that includes ppp how much are you assuming you can lag on deposit rates when rates rise timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well i mean were pleased that a third of the deposits are dda and obviously the bulk of the rest of it is very low rate at this point i think we will lag as rates move up hard to predict what will happen kind of with the ppp money again to my comments earlier weve not seen anything unusual with respect to deposit volatility i think it will continue to help us i think for the next couple of quarters youll see deposit costs go down almost in spite of what happens to rates and we should be in good shape david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and i think terry if my recollection is right the last time we have rising rates from the near zero environment the first basis points really there wasnt much of a rise on deposit costs and the second basis point increase was the same and we only started to see increases with the third increase and i would think that it would be similar to that if not even a longer lag because theres way more liquidity in the system right now and people arent as anxious to bring deposits in so i think if history repeats itself youd have at least basis point increase before youd see much movement by the industry and my personal opinion is because of our liquidity in the system but that might go well beyond that before you see much of an increase in deposit costs timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah and terry if it helps virtually none of our deposits are linked to an index so terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 thats helpful thank you and then as a followup we all know theres a large acquisition about to close later this year in your market and a new name about to enter your market so i guess my question is how quickly did you start to see the disruption from the last deal mbfi and how long did that window remain open for a bank like wintrust to capitalize on any opportunities edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well were starting to see a little of it the window stays open for a long time i mean our people gave it a year to see if its going to work or not really let loose on our pursuit of these guys on a previously announced deal it took about four or five years before we started seeing an outflow so you can guess which one that is but you can never really get anybody on the old place and now were getting people and assets that we never thought wed get to a very loyal to the old place so well be relentless on it and well see murph any thoughts richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no i think thats right its really kind of the tone that gets set by the acquiring institution and weve seen it run the gamut from the day that a deal gets announced and they come in and they immediately change the credit culture and just the overall tone of the organization but as ed points out weve seen the other side where it takes a while but eventually things change and people more customers and bankers sense that change and look to find something a little more in keeping with the way they like to be treated so i dont think theres one set answer to the question but it is inevitable edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp word of mouth has been great for us i mean these awards were getting from greenwich are very very helpful plus we walk the walk we dont just talk the talk people come over and they see our technology and what we have ill put up against the big banks for the most part were better than them because of the personal service we give on top of it and i get nothing but complimentary letters about how happy people are when they get over here ph so id say to stop there they were having a good time before but now they really are having a good time so word of mouth is happening a lot too plus i think our advertising is paying off as chicagos bank and wisconsins bank and they have great momentum there but we got to back that up we have been backing it up and the people we are seeing people from all the acquired organizations asking us what our plans are what were going to do and theres great interest on their part another thing is with remote working its helped us like on the it side ph we were able to pick up a number of people just because ph of our reputation we picked up a couple out in new york who heard who just heard how good we were to our clients and our people and they came with us so talent is out there i think our reputation helps and i think our momentum is very good and we dont see anything that will stop it right now terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks again appreciate it wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long from raymond james your question please david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc hey everyone thanks for taking my questions edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you doing david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good good good hey appreciate all the color on the loan growth and the margin expectations the question i want to ask you about now is more about youre hitting billion in assets here very soon how does that change your operating strategies and does that change how youre thinking about regulations and the ability to continue to acquire edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp not really because we do the smaller deals which arent going to historically weve done smaller deals which dont really get the attention of the big guys in dc when we do as of now who knows what will happen if the new ph oc the councilor comes in and we ought to speak russian or something then but right now we have great relationship with the regulators our cra is i mean almost what of the banks are outstanding and the other one is got hopefully really close and we always said that the regulators make the rules they are played by the rules you can yell at the ph ref only i can bump the ref but well play ph it by ear but i think we have a good reputation with them and indiscernible just because of how were structured we still are small i mean we might be billion in the aggregate but our average bank is what billion billion billion and the branches indiscernible have their own i mean everybody is an owner here were able to really ph be close to the customer with our decisions i think that model can keep going for a long time indiscernible comments on that david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i dont think theres anything magical about the billion mark per se i mean our infrastructure is such that we can have considerable growth and we just continue to build the infrastructure and the team to handle that so i dont see anything significant you hear in the marketplace that the bigger deals are a little bit slow to get regulatory approval right now but as id said we typically have done the smaller tuckin deals and those seem to be moving at a quicker pace so i dont see anything significant ph either david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 got it and then you mentioned the infrastructure to become a larger bank at what point do you have to upgrade ph is that core deposit system ph couldnt handle a doubling your size at this point or is there at some point that you would need to make any additional investments edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well no we i think our investments and indiscernible very good job at telling you how much ph we spend on this but we have lots of room to grow here we have really upgraded every system ph in the joint and made it and thats just okay but very flexible in terms of being able to work off the base systems that we have and add things out and take ph more often tim you want to comment on that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah david ph were playing from a host system standpoint and the enhancements and new introduction of services on the digital side is really starting to pay dividends and so i think in terms of getting to the point where were comfortable at billion weve been working that for years and so i dont see any immediate issues at all in that front and were wellpositioned to continue to grow david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for the color and keep up the good work thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your question please christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ed maybe a question on ma just to further explore it i mean youve got so much momentum organically right now and weve seen some of the reactions for deals in the buyer stocks i guess why do you even need to consider a deal at this point is there something that is there a business you need to build out or a market you need to develop a little bit more wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well weve always been opportunistic about it its got to make sense on the pricing side and strategically we havent done it beyond a couple of years because ph we have found one that did that but weve always been very very prudent in how we approach it so i said before a thousand times were not going to give up a lot of tangible book value to grow ph you have five years with earnings to grow a share doesnt make a lot of sense we take what the market gives us right now its giving us organic growth pricing on deals big or small as big deals are a pain in the neck not to say that we wouldnt consider it but i if i want to philosophize that every big deal weve seen starts with taking care of management before they take care of shareholders and that drives me absolutely crazy absolutely nuts and guys who come in and you start with that in the conversation about what about us what about our shareholders ph and more management is last you cut your deal and live with it ph so its not that we havent had we have every investment bank in the world calling on us about this deal or that deal or big deals and how big we could be and thats kind of important to us whats important to us is continue to grow like we grow the market gives us right now this organic growth is awesome smaller deal is still our bread and butter up to billion is good but it has to make sense it has to make sense strategically it has to make sense economically and bigger deal it would just be all it just doesnt make a lot of sense right now for a lot of reasons but you never know ph maybe we have one that does make sense but ill tell you it drives me nuts when management ph says a lot about me and then oh yeah what about my shareholders i hate those conversations and they are turn off right out of the box for me i agree with you the markets given us great growth why differentiate deviate from that and therell be a time when the acquisitions become more affordable and make more sense and well jump in then dave you got anything on that david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i think thats right we understand concept you laid out chris but we can walk and indiscernible at the same time theres a deal that comes up that makes economic and cultural sense but is uncertain were not going to overpay or do a deal just to do a deal so were enjoying the organic growth now and pipelines are good and ph we want keep marching to that too for the time being christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great great answer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race from piper sandler your question please nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys afternoon going back to terrys question on some of the loan growth drivers in the context of the ma disruption thats ongoing curious in terms of the commercial real estate indiscernible we saw in wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 the quarter obviously indiscernible things you guys benefit from uptick ph and line utilization but just curious how much of that growth youre seeing is appropriate on the commercial side of things is being driven by share gains and curious within that context what inning were in terms of wintrust benefiting from all the ma related disruption thats occurred in chicago within the last few years edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp rich richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i would say were in pretty early innings at this point i mean we as we talk about a couple of questions ago this disruption has really been a pretty recent phenomenon over the last four five years so we think that the goodwill that got established during pandemic through ppp and we basically told all of our lenders when the pandemic hit this is when you really start to differentiate yourself as being a banker that you can count on and customers appreciated the fact that we were out of the box reaching out seeing what they needed doing the things that make us different i had lunch with one of our bankers that we hired from one of our competitors recently and he said it was the exact opposite at the bank he was at that they were curtailing lines and they were bumping rates and doing things that in the shortterm we couldnt enhance the overall return but in the long run youre just going to really just anger your customers so i think theres a long way to go here i mean our market share is still relatively small in chicago and milwaukee relative to the competitors so i think theres a real strong opportunity here over the next couple of years to be able to grow that core business nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats great color and maybe just changing gears i had a question dave on mortgage curious if you could kind of remind us in terms of the gainonsale margin expansion that we saw this quarter is a little more pronounced than we saw from some others so just curious if you can remind us in terms of the va arm what that secondary market premium tends to look like in terms of or at least on a relative basis to the kind of conventional 30year product generally speaking david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well im trying to figure out how to answer that its just youre wondering about the directionality of the gainon sale margins nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah and just unique to wintrust obviously you guys have the va arm that contributes somewhere around a quarter of volumes each quarter so just curious in terms of what that gainonsale margin benefit from having that production arm in the fold relative to just the typical 30year conventional product wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well its certainly is higher but as far as the blend ph of the gain on sale margin thats pretty much been a quarter of our business for the last over a year so i dont think its going to change the directionality of the overall margin it may be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter as the purchase business goes down in the chicago area because veterans first does business all over the country and a lot in the southern states but i dont think it would change dramatically we actually think as far as our margin goes it increased a little bit this quarter as secondary marketing gains and losses were a little bit better this quarter as far as that hedging activity indiscernible and a little bit of product mix change where veterans first was of the volume versus last time so those two factors helped increase the margin a little bit our thoughts for the fourth quarter right now and again itll depend on mix of business and some other secondary marketing volatility that could or may not happen but we would expect the gain on sale margins to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats really helpful i appreciate all the color thanks guys nice quarter david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the ph ruther from da davidson your question please q hey good afternoon guys just one big picture question for me at this point and it relates to slide of your deck that highlights the geographic and loan portfolio diversification and clearly paying dividends with the growth you guys are putting up im just curious are there any geographies you are not in that youd like to be or loan products or niche lending verticals that would fill out this map further edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well were always looking for new niches problem is right now there is one out there they want a lot of money for if you want to buy it and kind of indiscernible like starting from scratch and ph doesnt pay in big dollar and have a big tbd dilution rich you want to comment on the other side richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 yeah no i think thats right i mean we are always looking at opportunities i think the leasing example is a good one we started that three years ago and have built that out because of exactly what youre talking about it gives us a much more geographic spread to the loan portfolio but if we were to i think if we had bought something of comparable size we would have paid a substantial premium on it so we like to be building these things but right now i think its not so much about markets that were not necessarily in but really trying to expand the markets i mean i think that certainly adjacent to the footprint we would like a bigger presence in indiana wed like to expand our presence in wisconsin and looking around the midwest you can kind of see some of the other markets that i think would really appreciate kind of what we do and how we run our business because there really isnt a wintrust type alternative in some of the meaningful cities around the midwest and then were also looking at opportunities weve been able to through following our cre sponsors to other markets weve seen some real good opportunities and weve been able to build the wintrust brand in some markets that historically we havent had been in and havent had a presence and were looking at doesnt make sense to step out a little bit and maybe open up lpos or see how that would fair but its definitely something that is thats why we put this slide in here its front and center for us to make sure that why we love chicago and wisconsin we want to make sure that were just having good diversification within the portfolio edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp concentration skill i always say that indiscernible diversify between product type and geography thats a very good thing q thank you guys that was it for me i appreciate your thoughts edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our final question for today comes from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your question please brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks hey dave just following up on the mortgage banking i just wanted to clarify so we should look for to origination drop and similar rev drop in q4 correct david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah thats right brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc is that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp now those applications in october have been very similar to september so far a little less than july and august but just based upon seasonality thats what were thinking and i think its fairly in line with the ph mba forecast too so brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay so thats you just hit on it thats more seasonality than any rate move thats already percolated through your pipeline thats just what youre expecting for things to kind of fall off david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp hopefully its a little bit better than that but thats what our expectations are right now i dont think we generally are too much different than the overall market on origination trends so brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and shifting over to ppp i apologize if i missed this already but youve got about million left i believe whats kind of the cadence of that recognition do you think timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp its probably from the fee standpoint maybe another to of that comes in the fourth quarter and then it tails off from there depending on kind of what we see in terms of customer seeking forgiveness but as we talked about we think the loans will drop off quite a bit and fees follow brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay all right thank you operator thank you this does conclude the questionandanswer session of todays program id
