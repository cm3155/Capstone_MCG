for joining us to discuss the first quarter financial results i want to begin our call this morning by saying that our thoughts go out to all those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic this is an event without parallel for our company our region and our nation we recognize that our clients and communities depend on us now more than ever as a company that serves a vital role in the economies of our footprint we see firsthand the impact that this crisis has on individuals and companies and we remain committed to helping our clients through this trouble time and while our call will detail our first quarter results well spend a significant amount of time today discussing the impact of this new economic environment on our company as steven mentioned we have a big lineup today that should provide insight into our response and our outlook relative to covid19 with respect to the first quarter bok financial recorded net income of million and diluted earnings per share of earnings this quarter were impacted dramatically from a shifting economic outlook and falling oil bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 prices that drove the significant increase in our loan loss provisions under the newly adopted cecl accounting standards which marc maun will talk about in detail a bit later not to minimize expected credit losses but if we focus on preprovision net revenue in comparison to previous quarters the results were really solid preprovision net revenue was million this quarter versus million last quarter and million for the first quarter last year showcasing the contribution of our diversified mix of business revenues net interest revenue declined million to million this quarter despite multiple rate cuts in the latter half of and basis points of emergency rate cuts in march of libor has remained relatively elevated this combined with our ability to decrease deposit costs has preserved a large portion of our margin steven will talk later about actions weve taken to position the balance sheet and drive deposit costs further down our brokerage and trading and mortgage banking revenues continue to outperform on strong mortgagebacked securities trading and mortgage loan production volumes fees and commissions revenue was up over from last quarter building on the previous years momentum while mortgage banking revenues grew over on a linkedquarter basis as you can imagine the growth in this area accelerated in the last month in the first quarter and likely will continue to be a leader in coming quarters expense management was excellent this quarter as well with expenses down compared to last quarter while decreased incentive compensation was the main driver this quarter we also took several steps related to delaying the filling of open positions and reducing discretionary spend in detail later in the call which should help expense levels for the remainder of this year turning to slide periodend loans were billion up over ph from last quarter while this was positive for the company overall a significant portion of this was due to increased draws particularly in our commercial and industrial portfolio periodend deposits were up nearly linkedquarter and up over yearoveryear a continuation of the streak we demonstrated in even with the significant growth in deposits we were able to bring overall interestbearing deposit costs down from in the fourth quarter to this quarter as we were able to adjust rates paid on exception price deposits in our commercial portfolio much more quickly than expected assets under management or in custody were understandably down for the quarter as equity markets weighed on asset prices that said prudent diversification of our clients assets helped us to relatively outperform the broad market selloff in addition we saw an opportunity to invest further in our company this quarter as we bought back bokf shares at per share in the open market ill provide additional perspective on the results after the prepared remarks but now ill turn it over to marty grunst our chief risk officer to cover our business resiliency and employee safety response to the coronavirus pandemic marty and his team were instrumental in making sure we were able to respond quickly while also maintaining business continuity throughout our footprint marty bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 martin e grunst chief risk officer executive vice president bok financial corp thank you steve i will summarize the steps we have taken since activating our business continuity plan at the outset our chief human resources officer and i established a dual mandate of maximizing employee safety and ensuring continuity of service we then developed and implemented an array of strategies to accomplish those goals including work from home for of our employee base whose jobs can be performed remotely an array of social distancing actions for those working in the office which includes separating work teams among multiple locations further separation using split shifts and assigning dedicated entry and exit doors break rooms and the like for different teams we migrated banking centers to a drivethru and appointmentonly format and subsequently reduced hours a bit and closed some banking centers temporarily to enable more shift rotation enhanced cleaning procedures have been implemented in all our locations to address increased demand on our call center and increased volumes in both mortgage and sba lendings we have temporarily repositioned employees from banking centers and other departments all across the firm into those highdemand areas and most importantly we rolled out an array of employee support initiatives in recognition of the changing environment for our staff these include up to five days of additional paid timeoff incremental financial support for employee childcare waiving copays for usage of our telemedicine capability and premium pay for certain non exempt employees who need to remain in the office our team is ready to support operations in whatever environment we find ourselves in lastly i would like to offer my thanks to the many employees who have worked tirelessly these past several weeks to ensure we are there for each other our customers and our communities ill now turn the call over to norm bagwell to cover our response to customer needs norm norman p bagwell executive vice presidentregional banks chief executive officerbank of texas bok financial corp thanks marty the impact of covid19 on many midsize and small businesses across the nation is unprecedented the necessary distancing efforts were not only impactful to businesses with a high reliance on social gatherings but the spillover effects are being felt throughout our markets our clients rely on us now more than ever so our focus has been on coordinating the building of an effective bridge to clients as most of our bankers have transitioned to working from home weve engaged our clients in deep portfolio management discussions focused on the state of business along with managing through the request for payment deferrals and renewals we are also working with clients to rightsize interest costs by adjusting earning credit rate and interest rates on deposits as the interest rate environment has shifted we have reintroduced interest rate floors where appropriate were having active discussions on interest rate swaps ph that are also recurring and some of our clients take advantage of the lowrate environment new business is being booked as we have been able to pull through pipeline items during this time as well all the while we are actually riskgrading our portfolio through the cycle weve also been incredibly proactive with our clients in wealth management space active management and hightouch client service have been out of favor recently but times like these allow us to demonstrate why bok financials wealth management expertise is a standout amongst peers bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 we have employees providing guidance to thousands of clients running from advising individuals on how weather trying markets with personal assets theyre helping corporate clients reposition their balance sheets while high set service has been facilitated primarily by the phone and email we were also seeing these clients utilize our technology at a higher rate our private wealth and retail brokerage digital logins were up and monthovermonth respectively and weve seen a increase in digital transactions by participants in our institutional wealth offerings our digital account performance monitoring capabilities have seen dramatic increases in usage as well with some areas of wealth management staying upwards of increases in performance logins from february to march with all of this rapid adoption continuous digital communication with our clients about the broader economic factors at play has been a real key most recently our client discussions have been centered on the cares act and its aimed to provide nearly billion of loans to small businesses via the small business administrations paycheck protection program or ppp as a certified sba lender bokf was open for ppp business the day the program went live on friday april hundreds of our employees were redeployed from their typical roles in commercial banking and consumer banking working tirelessly to take applications and reserve funding for their clients feedback from our clients as it relates to our ability to respond has been very positive and proven differentiated versus our peers im incredibly proud of our efforts to serve our clients and communities by helping them bridge this time of economic uncertainty bok financial has processed approximately completed ppp applications and weve received billion sba approvals while we would characterize our quick action for our clients as a success it was not without its challenges the short 10day funding window presented a bit of an operational burden but we have successfully met that standard additionally the sheer volume of applications for our credit services team in such a short time was challenging to say the least but the resiliency and flexibility of our credit team has proved out in fact enhanced quality control checks were put in place during this time to ensure ph accuracy and viability of the applications with that ill now turn it over to stacy to cover our energy healthcare and commercial real estate portfolios stacy stacy c kymes executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp thanks norm as you can see on slide periodend loans were billion up more than for the quarter our commercial real estate was largely flat this quarter ci expanded over from the previous quarter primarily in the general business energy and healthcare portfolios in general the traditional ci portfolio had growth that was a combination of both seasonal factors and customer responses to the covid19 pandemic these revolving lines of credit are generally secured and governed by a borrowing base and in many cases the customer draws were deposited back into the bank there were very limited draw request in the specialized lines of business in response to the current macro environment line of credit draws have leveled off and are relatively unchanged since the end of march energy loans outstanding totaled billion at the end of the first quarter or of total loans our energy exposure has bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 created volatility in our stock price but supporting the energy industry has been a hallmark of the company for over a century on slide you can see that the majority of this portfolio is first lean senior secured reservebased lending to oil and gas producers which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending a decline in the demand for energy related to the covid19 pandemic coupled with the opec production conflict has led the declines in the current spot in future oil prices approximately of our committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil the remaining are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas which has not been significantly impacted by the recent events most clients had a production mix of oil and natural gas as we have said in the past we believe the duration of the oil price decline is a more significant factor affecting performance than the level of prices if drivers of this decline are short term meaning less than months then our expected losses in the portfolio will not be overly impactful to the company one factor that is much more in our favor during this downturn is customer hedges that are in place of all energy customers that we stress test which makes up of production loans outstanding of those customers have some level hedging in the 12month range and many of them carrying into the 24month range we believe the combination of our disciplined underwriting approach and customer hedging positions will work to weather this downturn as we have previous downturns our healthcare sector loan balances increased million to billion or of total loans on slide you can see that our healthcare sector loans primarily consist of billion of senior housing and care facilities including independent living assisted living and skilled nursing generally we lend to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risk specific to a single facility we have had a few instances of covid19 among a handful of facilities but the response of our healthcare operators has mitigated any significant impact up to this point the remaining balance of our healthcare portfolio is comprised of hospitals and other medical service providers who have also been impacted by a deferral of elective procedures to ensure adequate protective equipment and ventilators for those providing acute care for virus patients it should also be pointed out that the cares act has multiple revenueenhancement measures for both hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as they manage through the risks of the virus we remain confident in the longterm outlook in this space and expect it to continue to be a growth leader once the health and economic conditions migrate to a more normal state commercial real estate loan balances were largely unchanged from the last quarter representing of total loans looking a little deeper into this segment on slide loan secured by office buildings and other properties increased the total of million this quarter this increase was largely offset by a decrease of million of loans secured by industrial facilities multifamily residential loans are our largest segment on commercial real estate lending totaling billion at quarterend loans secured by retail facilities were million at march as we think about real estate more broadly we enter this downturn relatively wellpositioned we have traditionally limited cre to of tier capital which supplements our category construction tenant and state bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 at march our legacy commercial real estate portfolio was under all our limits and sublimits clearly the retail portion of this portfolio is the most vulnerable to sustain stayathome and shelterinplace directives this portfolio is roughly split between goods and services as of the end of the retail cre segment had a weighted average regulatory loantovalue of and a weighted average debt service coverage of almost times as with oil the lost content in retail will be closely correlated with the duration of the various governmental orders and adjustments in consumer behavior after these orders are lifted while office and multifamily will see impact here we believe our geographic footprint will help us in these segments in the long term because of the strong in migration over time we will not be able to avoid the impacts of all the macroeconomic credit issues impacting financial institutions we have historically proven to be disciplined underwriters of credit the last cycle certainly demonstrated that and we remain confident our standards will perform well in the current cycle ill turn the call over to marc maun to discuss other loan portfolios credit metrics and the impact of cecl implementation marc marc c maun chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide weve compiled a list of loan segments we consider more exposed to the economic slowdown driven by the social distancing measures in place to combat the coronavirus as you can see the exposure to entertainment and recreation retail hotels churches airline travel and higher education that are dependent on large social gatherings to remain profitable is roughly of our total portfolio this group of loans is highly diversified with over loans for an average loan size of less than million some of these clients will participate in the paycheck protection program that will provide some measure of relief to stress that they may be feeling well obviously be monitoring these exposures closely in the coming months just a few words from my seat as chief credit officer on the energy portfolio that stacy described above on the energy side the spring borrowing base redetermination season is underway and we will be engineering the value of our customers reserves during the second quarter we also conduct a quarterly stress test of our energy borrowers with more than funding on their lines of credit and all criticized loans using a price deck discounted by which helps us identify potential issues the most recent stress test which takes customer hedges into consideration resulted in no surprises on slide you can see credit quality has remained well intact to this point but our expectation is to see migration of nonaccrual and potential problem loans given the current economic environment additionally we have taken action regarding loan modification requests on a case by case basis requests have generally been for days of principal and possibly interest with a reevaluation at the end of that period for another days based on the recent regulatory guidance these loans are not considered troubled debt restructures if they are in correct status as of march nonaccruing loans decreased million this quarter primarily due to a million decrease in nonaccruing commercial real estate loans however nonaccruing energy loans increased million in the first quarter new nonaccruing loans identified in the first quarter totaled million offset by million in payments and received a million in chargeoffs potential problem loans totaled million at march up from million at december this increase largely comes from the energy portfolio as the recent oil price declines coupled with the capital markets bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 environment requiring certain customers to work through their liquidity needs weighed on some energy borrowers this situation may lead to additional nonaccruals and some impairments as steve noted in his opening comments the company adopted cecl as of january and we have increased total reserves by million since slide shows the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision under cecl the day one adjustment shows an increase in acl reserves of million the total day one adjustment includes an additional million for mortgage banking activities and htm securities for a total of million which is what we disclosed last quarter and that amount impacted capital not earnings this quarter the day two provision for credit losses under cecl was million for the first quarter a degrading macroeconomic outlook during the first quarter related to the covid19 pandemic and oil price declines were the two factors most impacting the cecl calculations in those calculations the company used base case downside and upside economic scenarios including key economic indicators such as gross domestic product unemployment and oil prices assumptions used in the scenarios for the second quarter of range from negative to negative for gdp to almost for unemployment and to for oil prices the forward view of the economy improves modestly over the remaining quarters of other economic factors used in the models include credit spreads home price indexes and vacancy rates more detail will be provided in our first quarter 10q to support sensitivity analysis of these factors as it relates to our total portfolio portfolio changes represent the impact of shifts in loan balances age and mix as well as credit quality adding million to the acl first quarter provision expense also included million related to net chargeoff activity our allowance for loan losses after day one and day two first quarter provision totaled million plus another million recorded in other liabilities to cover unfunded loan commitments although the entire reserve from loan losses is available to cover losses in any portfolio million is attributed to our outstanding energy portfolio ill now turn the call over to steven nell steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks marc as noted on slide net interest revenue for the quarter was million down million from the fourth quarter net interest margin was down only basis points from the previous quarter as libor has remained elevated relative to its historical relationship to other shortterm market interest rates this coupled with our ability to move interestbearing deposit costs down basis points has allowed us to preserve a large portion of our margin while the basis points of interest rate cuts by the fed in march did have an impact on both net interest revenue and net interest margin the full effect will be realized in the second quarter the most significant component of net interest revenue and net interest margin that we can most influence is deposit costs were working closely with our depositors to secure and maintain balances but price appropriately given the almostzero rate environment at which we operate in the month of march our interestbearing deposit cost declined to basis points and we believe we can continue to lower our costs over the coming months bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 on slide fees and commissions were million an increase of from last quarter and quarterly yearoveryear continuing to be primarily fueled by strength in our brokerage and trading and mortgage businesses we generated record revenues in our trading and derivative businesses this quarter with total brokerage and trading revenues eclipsing million the majority of this was derived from mortgage related trading activity with first quarter mbstba trading revenue of million a increase over linked quarter and a increase from the same quarter a year ago while the growth rates here are impressive even more impressive was that this increased revenue from mortgage trading activity was partially muted by a decrease in the fair value of asset backed and municipal securities due to widening spreads given the lower rates and higher volatility in the mortgage markets our traders have done a phenomenal job supporting our clients management and repositioning of their investment and hedging portfolios mortgage banking saw a significant surge in production revenue this quarter growing million or over relative to last quarter and almost from the same quarter a year ago total mortgage production volume increased to over billion from three finances representing of that volume additionally we increased our gain on sale margins by basis points compared to last quarter another success story of the quarter relates to the hedging of our mortgage servicing rights given the speed and magnitude of the decline in mortgage rates the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights declined million in the first quarter however our securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge offset million of that decline the securities held as hedges also yielded net interest revenue of million so the net msr activity resulted in a million benefit this quarter an impressive outcome for this environment fiduciary and asset management revenue was down just over this quarter which might be a surprise to some given the perceived market sensitivity of this segment in reality only about a third of these assets are exposed to equities today which has added resiliency through the cycle strong sales efforts coupled with this prudent diversification proved out with relative outperformance many of our fee businesses are clearly off to a great start this year and once again highlight the significance of the revenue diversity that our company has turning to slide total operating expenses decreased a little more than million down from the fourth quarter personnel expense decreased million this quarter largely due to the combination of a decrease in both deferred compensation and regular compensation of million additionally the fourth quarter included approximately million in severance costs due to realignment of personnel that did not recur employee benefits increased million as a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan expenses was partially offset by decreased employee healthcare costs nonpersonnel expense decreased as well down million compared to the fourth quarter mortgage banking costs decreased million largely due to the reduction in msr amortization expense business promotion expense decreased million due to the seasonal decrease in advertising costs combined with reduced travel costs as a result of the current pandemic in addition the fourth quarter included a million charitable contribution to the bokf foundation which did not recur this quarter as steve alluded to earlier we have taken steps to help maintain lower expense levels for the remainder of first we have put a hold on all planned adds to staff and are challenging all positions that become open before we recruit a replacement second we will achieve savings in business promotion ph special consulting fees and occupancyrelated expenses in the current workfromhome environment and lastly weve decided to delay all nonessential it and other projects in this less than favorable operating environment well bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 continue to support clientfacing initiatives that enhance our customers overall experience and other important projects in support of infrastructure prioritizing and slowing the pace of lesscritical projects is prudent until the economic picture becomes clear while our liquidity remains strong given the extraordinary impact of the pandemic on the capital markets weve taken a number of precautionary measures to ensure it remains so including enhanced daily monitoring of our liquidity by tracking deposit inflows and outflows by customer analyzing loan advances by segment optimizing our borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank and increasing our collateral to federal reserve discount window among other things as mentioned earlier our deposit balances and ability to gather additional deposits have remained strong as noted on slide we have over billion of secured borrowing capacity and over billion of unsecured and contingent liquidity capacity to support the liquidity needs of the company additionally were in a position to fund ppp loans now totaling billion via the federal reserve ppp liquidity facility our capital position also remains strong in fact it was a noted reason that bokf na the primary source of holding company liquidity had its a rating reaffirmed recently by sp and moodys with a common equity tier ratio of well ahead of our internal operating range minimum and a full basis points above regulatory minimums we are in good shape we will also take advantage of the occs capital phasein plan for cecl implementation and lastly a word on guidance due to the uncertainty around the severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the broader economy we will not provide the more formal guidance weve given in the past but well leave with a few thoughts that might be helpful apart from the loan advances todate of million and the ppp fundings of billion we expect no loan growth for the foreseeable future energy deals will likely not be done at current prices healthcare opportunities are generally on hold due to the pandemic and little activity will be present in our cre and ci portfolios we will continue to originate mortgage loans with a very limited amount ending up in our permanent portfolio we will continue to reduce deposit costs ensuring our deposits are appropriately priced given the nearzero rate environment all in the context of overall funding needs we took advantage of the dramatic widening of mortgage spreads in the first quarter to preinvest several months of anticipated cash flows from our availableforsale securities portfolio at significantly advantageous spreads after those anticipated casuals have been realized we will resume reinvesting in mortgagebacked securities with appropriate spreads and controlled prepayment and extension characteristics our diversity revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall earnings pressure being felt in the spread businesses our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and nonpersonnel cost will continue we have no plans to cut existing capabilities or products and although we will slow lesscritical projects well continue to provide funding for improvements in the client experience in technology infrastructure we entered this downturn with a strong capital position and do not see a threat to the dividends we pay as always we view stock buybacks optimistically but within the context of maintaining our strong capital position ill turn the call back to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 thanks steven the first quarter as we describe contains some positive operating results no doubt the day cecl provision was meaningful and we cant predict at this point what subsequent quarters will hold weve yet to spend the full quarter in a near zero rate environment this year so we fully expect that to weigh on our spread businesses going forward that coupled with a selfinduced economic slowdown took a bath to spread of the virus will dampen growth for all financial institutions in that said there are several bright spots specifically at bokf namely in our wealth management and mortgage businesses that have every opportunity to outperform in as always we are taking a measured approach to all decisions we are absorbing the impact of much lower asset rates while looking for the best cost alternatives in funding going forward we have strong liquidity and capital so we have the luxury of making thoughtful changes that wont inhibit our growth opportunities when this environment corrects as it inevitably will in the meantime we will continue to work to manage expenses where possible putting some projects on hold and curtailing personnel growth as well as other measures until we see a definite improvement in demand i would say that weve added some negative bias since the quarter end as we seek to understand the long road ahead for the return of meaningful economic activity we can envision a gdp decline and rate of unemployment in the second quarter that is more severe than what we modeled at quarter end but these are uncharted waters for us all so we will respond on behalf of our customers accordingly and do everything we can to assist them regardless of the nearterm future of the economy and we remain confident that weve built our company to perform even in times of extreme economic stress we have a very experienced leadership team which gives me full confidence in our ability to navigate this challenge as we have countless others our time horizon is always a bit longer than most at bok financial and i fully expect us to shine when the history is written on this economic challenge with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning everyone steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning ken steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thought we might as well start off with energy i know you said that of your customers have some level of hedging so hopefully i would like to know how much hedging but the real question is could you just talk about the credit quality of either the energy loans or the borrowers that either dont have any hedging at all or even part of that on that part of their production that is not hedged ie is that much more at risk thanks stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp this is stacy ill speak to the customer heading over three quarters of our current oilweighted commitments are at least hedged in at an average price in excess of so we feel very good about the level of hedging that we have within our customer base and really that is one of the most extraordinary mitigants of the downside and we continue to point to the time horizon as being the bigger risk than the absolute price of the commodity clearly as you go into the cycle we came into the cycle with a relatively good book we had some certain customers who had a certain level of weakness but as we look at that going into this we feel very good about that and i think that that as we position ourselves for the time horizon were going to be in a shape thats very manageable for us just to remind everybody because we get awfully focused on the spot price and whats happening on the daily ticker oil prices collapsed in from a barrel to a barrel in a short period of time in we saw another oil price collapse from a barrel to a barrel in a relatively short time during that period of time natural gas was also under a significant amount of pressure in the fiveyear period ending at the end of our cumulative losses from the last collapse over a fiveyear period was million we dont know the length or duration of this cycle but we do know that weve done a good job historically of underwriting energy credits and so we feel very confident in our ability to work through and bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 manage this but our focus is not on shortterm pricing but on the longterm curve because we believe thats more indicative of how our customers will perform over time marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp ken this is marc maun ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp im just going to add one quick thing to this is that even today looking at this the forward curve we need to keep in mind that its highly contango its very steep so even if customers even after looking at for the last couple of days if you look at even later this year and into youre seeing prices that are reaching or over a barrel so there is opportunity on those customers who were not hedged that they have opportunity for us to work with them to identify ways that we can enhance their overall quality of their cash flow by taking a look at hedging opportunities and working with them in that way ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay thats helpful and then maybe just a second question obviously you mentioned the libor has been a big driver of why your nims held up as much as it has if and when libor does start to normalize relative to fed funds could you just help us quantify like how meaningful is that to your portfolio and whats it mean for margin how much is exposed to libor versus prime for example thanks steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp sure ken this is steven nell yeah libor has held about a to basis point advantage relative to its historic relationships its actually come in about or basis points over the last week thats somewhat meaningful because as you know roughly of our loan book is variable and i would say the majority of that is libor based and so we have gotten some advantage from that spread we do think it will come in over time and without giving a specific dollar amount or percentage impact it will have some narrowing impact on our margin going forward if it reverts back to a more historical position ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp and this is stacy the one thing i might add there is we certainly have benefited from the slow fall of libor its really given us time in our deposit base to focus on higher rate deposits and managing through that if we look at we have about billion of what we call exception price deposits so that were kind of higher rate than the standard pricing weve moved that down over basis points since the end of february through the middle of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 april so its not theres multiple sides to that equation as we think about the margin going forward clearly weve benefited from libor but as its been slow to fall its given us time to kind of rightsize the pricing on our broader deposit base which we think will help us as a counterbalance there ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great i appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe sticking with credit first can you share with us what level of deferral activity youve had in the specifically in the atrisk portfolios energy healthcare cre that are surrounded by the covid umbrella that arent necessarily classified as tdrs at this point marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah this is marc maun i can give you that i mean on the energy side weve actually had zero deferrals at this point in time and our overall deferral on the commercial side is around with the higher level of that is in the healthcare space on the commercial real estate side its running about of total dollars these are dollars outstanding as ive looked at surveys of our peer groups we are running on the lower end of the percentage of dollars being deferred across all those categories todate jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then specifically on the energy side whats your forecast for oil prices as youre determining this current reserve so when youre looking out once we get past that 12month period where are you looking at oil prices and i guess maybe just going back to first quarter of the allowance was i guess im just a little confused on how the allowance could be lower now given the broader move as well as the impact of cecl bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp well a couple of comments on the price forecast we follow the forward curve on the price deck that is published on a regular basis we set our price deck at the first day of each month based on the most recent changes in the price or the recent price deck for the five days preceding that beginning of that month and then during the month we will assess whether price declines are sufficient to justify reducing that price deck during the month at this point in time our price deck for april is pretty consistent with the exception of the spot price which we dont focus on we focus on first we throw out the first month and look at the price deck beyond that and our price deck for april is consistent with what the price forward curve is as of this morning so were still looking at it and kind of the opening the first year running around and from there growing to about by the second part of your question was more on the reserve size for energy our million reserves as stacy noted compares very favorably to our net charge off performance of the past five years its up million for it peaked in at million and midstream makes up a little bit bigger piece of that today which has a little bit lower reserve allocation than it did in at the same time were in april and we were doing this as of march based on the information we knew at that time i wont say that there wont be opportunities to build reserves as we move forward and watch what happens in our market what happens with our customers and what happens with energy prices in general but at the base two or three weeks post the opec plus changes the reserve made sense based on that and based on our history were comfortable with it as it is today and we will evaluate it going forward and make the appropriate reserve expectations during the second quarter stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp again a couple of things i might add there when we peaked in our reserve for energy as a percent it really peaked because we had pretty dramatic energy pay downs occurring so we had over million coming down and we had the allowance we werent using it to the extent that we had provided for it so that was really a kind of a denominator effect that rose that percentage up i think the absolute dollar amount that marc alluded to is a more fair comparison there from that perspective i think marc touched on it but clearly trying to peg anticipated future losses around any of the portfolios really but energy particularly is a very difficult thing to do and well continue to evaluate over time i think the key for us to understand is we have a extraordinarily strong mix of fee revenue and we have a very high level of pretax preprovision revenue such that we have the flexibility to continue to add to the reserve at pretty material levels without ever impacting capital and so were wellpositioned for the future but we will continue to evaluate as things change to ensure that our provision remains adequate jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for that and just finally from me on the capital last quarter you had talked about a desire to build capital levels obviously theres been big dramatic changes in the first quarter but i guess how long do you feel comfortable with an elevated total capital return ratio at this point before we i guess worry about maybe other capital actions to help grow capital steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 yeah this is steven nell im very comfortable with the level of our common equity tier at that if you compare that to many peers its well ahead so i think weve got good capital flexibility as i mentioned in the comments i dont feel like theres any threat at this point in time on our dividend and i think well stay opportunistic i dont want to say well suspend today any buybacks i want to stay opportunistic but all in the context of that strong capital position so lets let some time go by here and see what occurs i agree with stacys comments weve got tremendous preprovision or net revenue generation weve got good revenue diversity so weve got plenty of strength in terms of earnings power weve got a very adequate reserve and a very strong capital position so i think weve got good opportunity there to continue paying dividends and be opportunistic as we go forward on buybacks jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james please proceed with your question michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions i just want to circle back on the energy portfolio maybe what i think im hearing you say is that based on what we know now because if i look at your downside case its actually above the 12month strip as it stands today so what i think i hear you saying is that with assuming you end the quarter near these levels and with borrowing base redeterminations going on and borrowing base is obviously going to come down you would expect to have another reserve build for the energy book in the second quarter is that the way we should think about it marc marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp well i think we will we have to factor in the hedging component too as part of the borrowing base redetermination season and we have substantial hedge book but certainly right now the forward curve of the price deck that were using is going to be based on the forward curve and it likely will bring borrowing bases down weve completed about todate so well take a look and see what the appropriate reserve level will be once we get through that spring determination season michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc and whats the average reduction in the borrowing base of that that youve gotten through marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp at this point in time i think were in the to range michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 okay thats helpful and then maybe just to round out on energy and tie it up what is different this energy downturn versus the to period and then the period it would seem from the outside looking in that eps would be more at risk this go around just given constraints on liquidity and variable access to capital outside of bank lines so maybe if you can just give the puts and takes on whats different this time thanks stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp well i think the biggest thing thats different is the level of hedging it is significant and as weve looked at marc mentioned about a quarter of these its been pretty impressive to see the level of hedging and how that has helped buoy the borrowing base and we see customers making decisions that around production around drilling much more quickly this time even to shut in wells at some level much more quickly this time than weve seen historically and that will have a pretty big supply effect but it will take some time for that to play through clearly the demand impact from covid19 is the wild card here when does the economy begin to rebound when do we get planes in the air which are large users of oil through jet fuel when does the demand return i think to me at this point this is really a demand equation less than the supply equation i think the supply is going to come down and its going to come down relatively quickly but the wild card from my perspective is the demand question how quickly that comes back you had demand issues as well in the price decline from the broader recession and so at the end of the day you have imbalances in supplydemand that have to be worked through and i think that youll see the market do that and it has historically done that but it takes time generally to months for it to find some kind of equilibrium which is why we continue to focus on that time period as opposed to the absolute on what we see today but we think the markets have responded appropriately but we think the primary risk as we look forward here is really around the demand impact and how quickly that can recover once we get a resumption of some kind of business activity michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate all the color guys thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 good morning peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i was wondering steven could you provide some color on the second quarter outlook on some of the fee income businesses i mean you had great quarters quarter in brokerage and trading and mortgage and im just wondering if that level is going to be sustainable and if you could just talk about some of the other businesses steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i can do that peter whether its sustainable i mean the environment is really an odd environment so its hard to say i think what ive said in the kind of limited guidance that we gave is that i do feel like the brokerage and trading and the mortgage business will clearly be supportive and additive to revenue streams to help offset some of the pressure that well feel on net interest income and net interest margin so my expectation is theyll stay strong the environment is its volatile it does provide us opportunity on the trading side to help our clients position hedges to position their investment portfolios certainly the mortgage activity as of today continues to be very very strong we did a really nice job i think of improving margins in our mortgage business up basis points i believe and that will continue so i think theyll be very supportive in the second quarter as they were in in the first quarter now to what level im not wont go there but certainly i think theyll be very supportive peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and just some of the other like the payments business and wealth management steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i might let stacy answer on the transfer and payment businesses stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp sure if you think about the payments business i think as we go into april we certainly saw a decline in atm and debit activity related to that business we also have seen more recently a pickup in activity as those stimulus checks have arrived i dont think its a dramatic slowdown but i think it is a modest slowdown on the payment side of the business as we look forward that business is awfully stable in good times and bad times but on a relative basis i think youll see the impact of slower consumer spending broadly in the second quarter in our payments business steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah peter this is steve bradshaw i think on the wealth management side we would expect to see some improving flow there there are some of our businesses like corporate trust that we think will grow in this current environment we also are seeing inflows on the equity side as we were seeing people feeling that theres the bottom has been reached in many cases so were seeing some flow out of cash into equity bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 and obviously were seeing a lot of reposition on the fixed income side that was a big driver in the first quarter dont see anything as we sit here today that would suggest that that has abated any so i would expect that area to continue to stevens point to be strong and to have some opportunities to grow even in this challenging environment peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and then just on the credit front on healthcare particularly the senior housing im just wondering if you could dig down a little bit deeper in terms of what youre seeing with the covid impact from a credit quality standpoint stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp sure peter this is stacy im glad to handle that i think theres three sectors that are impacted in the healthcare space hospitals if youre a rural hospital today if this is going to be very it could be very devastating impact to you we dont have rural hospitals in our portfolio that has particularly in our footprint where largely most of the states have not opted into the affordable care act rural hospitals have already been under significant pressure and that has not been an area of business development focus for us the hospital systems that we have have been impacted by really multiple things the delay of elective procedures which is a highermargin business for them as well as frankly people not utilizing the facilities in some cases when they need to because of fear of people being there who are covidpositive and contracting that those are very highend hospital health systems they have large endowments and they will be able to weather that we fully expect to see more liquidity needs from that health systems group as they are unlikely want to sell out of their endowment in a depressed and securities pricing environment so theyre going to be more likely to use lines of credit and things like that so we expect some increases from the portfolio but we really dont see material credit risk at all in that health systems group when we acquired cobiz they had a really strong and robust medical and physicians large practice group and that is the area that weve seen the larger amount of request in healthcare for deferral request and thats really because these are specialty styled practices that have been impacted most by the deferral of elective procedures and so our view is that we would expect that to be relatively temporary and generally indiscernible have doctors specific doctors who are guaranteeing the facility in addition to the corporate entity and so there may be some timing there may be some classification over time as we get financial statements there i dont see that as a significant risk of loss today although if we have a long period of time without access to those types of facilities that could certainly change in the senior housing space thats where certainly people have been most focused around credit risk and risk of loss i think that its important to understand we have in excess of skilled nursing facilities that are part of our portfolio we alluded in our earlier comments that we prefer multi facility operators because of the diversification we have around of our skilled nursing facilities have reported at least one case of covid so in the broader scale are relatively small but there is a lot of government support that will go into both the health systems and the skilled nursing in terms of medicare medicaid enhancements as well as additional funding to help with funding these enhanced controls around infection and funds for additional purchase of protective equipment et cetera that portfolio is holding up bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 well it will take time thats not a portfolio that were going to know today what exactly the impact is its going to take some time were obviously having conversations with our borrowers understanding how theyre impacted and what theyre doing but like i said roughly of the facilities in our portfolio have reported a case so we certainly understand that could change over time but as things begin to stabilize i feel pretty confident about the skilled nursing portfolio it wont be perfect but im not have a lot of concern there peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc right thanks a lot for the color operator thank you thank you our next question comes from line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hey brady steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well i had a question on energy hedging the energy market has acted so squarely this week when you saw the price of the may forward contracts go negative i was just wondering if that is an impact at all to the hedges that your energy companies have im not sure if they use the forward contracts to hedge and there is basis risk there those hedges not worked in the way that theyre supposed to or if they hedge via some other means stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp this is stacy i mean thats part of the noise that comes around everybody watching the spot price if we had been able to do that i think everybody in texas and oklahoma would have filled up their swimming pools with oil to be able to get paid to do that the borrowers really the hedging works on kind of on daily average basis for the trading days prior to closing the contract so that anomaly around we saw with the closing of the may contract was really not particularly impactful to the hedging and certainly creates noise and a lot of headlines but is not meaningful to the actual settlement of these hedges brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 okay and then on the expense side you had a decent stepdown in the compensation expenses ive heard you say some of that is related to incentive comp but i mean fees did really well and comp went down normally those kind of move together but maybe just help size it out as we look to the second quarter how do you think that comp line will trend is a good run rate or how much of that was kind of a onetime in nature benefit from the decrease in incentive comp steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah brady this is steven i would say roughly million of that stepdown was related to deferred compensation that runs through that line item and i would not expect that to recur so thats a reduction in the first quarter that wont recur but everything else i think is pretty good we look we stepped down a little bit on our personnel our regular and parttime salaries i think that will continue with some of the efforts that were taking on as the staff and certainly open positions and replacement of positions slowing some of our project cost and down a little bit so i think with regard to looking forward that one item of about million would be something that i would consider not to recur brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay then lastly for me just on the net interest margin steven youre saying were not going to see the full impact until the second quarter any idea of the magnitude of how much the margin could decline in i mean was down i think basis points or basis points how much do you think it could be down in steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i think theres too many moving parts i mean youve got significant advances on your loan book partially related to covid youve got ppp loans that are on the balance sheet now youve got funding costs related to that youve got significant inflows of deposits its impossible to tell you the exact magnitude of what the nim will look like but ill tell you and ill reiterate what stacy said earlier the biggest thing that we can do is really control our deposit costs and we are working very very hard he gave you an example of about billion of exception price deposits that we have moved down significantly i think our march interestbearing deposit cost was basis points and i expect that to migrate significantly lower over the coming quarters so thats going to be a nice benefit to help support net interest margin but clearly with the decline in the huge decline in rates that we saw in kind of early to midpart of march is going to have an impact on nim and theres just a lot of moving parts to consider so im not going to step out and say its going to be x number of basis points but it will be lower than the that you saw in the first quarter brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats fair thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust please proceed with your question bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning back to the energy loans could you help us frame just one comparison that investors may be looking at and that is that yesterday comerica reported and noted that their energy reserve today is about versus your so can you frame that up for us and also could you just talk about how you stress tested the energy book specifically in terms of a longer duration for this lower oil demand thanks marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp jennifer this is marc maun let me touch on framing it against comerica and to be honest i dont know their portfolio so cant really assess how theyre coming up with their particular numbers but i will say that in the to downturn we saw a number of banks that stepped out with significant energy reserves early in the process we tended to be at the lower end with some other banks that are very active in the energy space we base our energy reserve on what were looking at in terms of our portfolios characteristics are based on what we can assess from the structure of their engineering we have engineers and techs on staff so we feel we are doing a very strong analysis of what the not only what the price deck impacts are but understanding exactly how the well production and performance of those wells will be completed as part of that engineering process and then we also come back continually to the hedging concept is that that has a price protection that helps us not just look at what the current price deck is so we think we take all of those things together and we evaluate based on our past history too weve been consistent that weve had sufficient reserve more than sufficient reserves ph throughout cycles in energy to cover our ultimate losses and we will continue as we said before to evaluate on an ongoing basis to see that we have the appropriate reserve with regards to the stress test we tend to run at about as i said earlier a discount to our existing price deck which in the crude oil side ran it from ph early in up to kind of topping out around ph or a little plus on that and then natural gas at growing to about over a fiveyear period that stress test is done on without hedging basis as i said earlier right now that stress test is still reflective of what the forward curve is its well below what the its still at the below roughly of where the forward curve is today and so we take a look at that take a look at the hedging thats associated with the individual customers determine where our highest risks are we had a very small number of customers that continue to not have sufficient hedging and those are the ones weve identified the rest we had already identified as criticized loans and were working with so ph it wasnt a substantial increase in the number of customers that we think are higher risk and thats how we looked at the stress test stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp and i wont speak to a specific other entity but just broadly speaking we are in the control seat for of our energy relationships whether as the lead as the syndicating agent as the maybe its a single bank facility but i think that really helps us as we work through this to kind of help navigate and work through any issues that may come up in this environment bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you thats all very helpful when you pointed out the more pandemicsensitive industries casinos restaurants hotels et cetera what kind of deferral rate are you seeing among industries from that ph slide steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp actually i dont know that i have a specific for that broken down by industry i go back to the fact that our almost all of those are in our ci portfolio were running about total dollars i know that we have had some deferral requests on the casinos because they are completely shut down however those are mostly tribal casinos almost all of them which have pretty substantial liquidity reserves and in a lot of cases are maintaining their employment and that is one of the reasons that theyre asking for modifications we really havent had any to speak of of significance in the convenience stores specialty stores hotels the colleges and universities or airlines yet the restaurant side we have seen some that is a sizable portion of that is franchisee finance however were with very large brands very wellknown brands and so while were hearing sales are down to we know that theyre still able to do drivethru and curbside and delivery and the brand names are being supported by the franchisor in a lot of cases to provide longerterm support should this carry out farther stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp and as you know jennifer these types of areas are ones that weve materially underweighted over a very long period of time at bok financial these types of businesses have a harder time sustaining through a downturn and so we have historically not been a significant lender in this space the other area that we have been underweighted in significantly is any kind of leverage lending marc and his credit team have done a really good job managing through that where we have a large level of kind of cash flow only as our source of repayment so we feel pretty good as it relates to those more high risk segments of the spectrum jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay can you talk about just the unique aspects of that casino portfolio the indian casino portfolio and how severe the losses could be and how recourse works for those types of credits steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp well i mean ill talk about the way theyre structured i mean they are direct ph theyre to the casino operations of the individual tribes we generally as you know cannot take mortgages on casinos because of the sovereign nation status but all the nations have waived sovereign immunity on this and the way recourse would work is we take over the cash flow associated with the casino as i said these casinos are shut down for now however they have strong liquidity and have substantial cash balances so we dont see significant risk of loss as we would expect when the economy reopens that these facilities will reopen as well its hard to assess it depends again how long before they reopen were bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 comfortable that theyve got cash reserves on the most on the large vast majority of this portfolio that will support it through a reasonable closure period stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp jennifer an interesting side note on that is the stimulus payments began to roll out we saw a large uptick in our gaming segment of our debit card as well so its hard to assess theres going to be some offsets there these are very strong gaming operations and tribes that are behind them so it should be a very good portfolio jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning i just want to go back to the discussion around energy hedges and once we move beyond that months timeframe can you give us an idea or just some more clarity on how much that hedge production declines marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yeah this is marc we have about our customer base about a third of our oil weighted customers have more than hit of their average price their portfolio hedged at an average price of ended through and the gas is about a little bit larger more like hedged at an average price at ph what i would note is that we are still seeing people increasing their hedging activity into based on the curve price especially a couple of weeks ago when you were still looking at plus oil in so we would anticipate that hedge activity will start increasing over the latter half of this year as well into that year stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp and in fact over the last couple weeks we have seen significant hedging thats not reflected in these numbers you can hedge at a barrel as of oclock am this morning at a barrel so theres still ample opportunity for hedges to be layered in a lot of these companies will have maybe 18month rolling hedge programs and things like that so i think the number will continue to improve over the course of the year steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and i think one thing i should add is that this kind of price levels we dont need a return to or even level to see improved cash flow significantly for these companies in an environment where theyre discontinuing their drilling activity bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 if we see a couple dollar increase because of their operating expense leverage in this kind of environment they will have a dramatic increase in their overall cash flow and significantly reduce the potential risk of loss associated with these particular loans in this portfolio that is because theyre not having the expense of trying to use existing production to support capex expense now that would change if drilling increased but at this point in time given the current environment we dont anticipate any significant drilling activity matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and can you talk more about counterparty risk within the hedges are these hedges going through be okay or someone else just trying to figure out what entity is holding the wrong end of that hedge stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp well a lot of them are done through an exchange so youve got the exchange counterparties in hold post margin and the credit risk on that exchange is really very small we have some number of hedges that are done with single counterparties who were high investment grade rated but with very low credit lines bilaterally and so theres cash exchanged on a daily basis to settle any differences between the credit line provided and the changes in the price during that period of time so there is a modest amount of counterparty risk there but it is very slight at this point much much different than it was in the time period where most of this trading was done with single counterparties at credit limits much higher than what we use today matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful stacy thats all for me thank you guys operator thank you our final question this morning comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks guys good morning had a couple of questions first is on the retail commercial real estate portfolio that million you highlighted about million of that on that covid19 impact slide can you tell us the areas maybe that you did not include on that slide steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp well ill let stacy talk to you on the cre but i want to be clear that covid19 slide that retail is in our ci portfolio that is not part of the cre retail portfolio stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp yeah in terms of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co ph is that part of the retail trade portfolio stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp thats correct steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yes gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp and the retail cre portfolio is very wellpositioned i alluded to kind of that average debt service coverage we had at the end of for that portfolio what i failed to mention was that times was based on kind of a stress that we do at this case ph rate on a 25year ram so actual debt service will be much lower much better than that but we look at it on a kind of to try to normalize rates and things like that and as we look at that portfolio gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and so since you mentioned that that retail piece is from that wholesale and retail trade portfolio is the other billion of that billion segment is that all wholesale trade or is there other retail segments of that steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp no the million is the full amount of our retail exposure the rest of it would be in the wholesale side gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you and then id just ask one more question on the energy front im trying to square the dynamics we saw in the ep space last year where crude was over for the majority of the year and we still had growing levels of bankruptcies so this year and looking forward even with a portion of the production hedged at obviously the unhedged portion brings down kind of the weighted average price per barrel that the producers would be getting and then if you hedged going forward in the or low over the next couple years that would seem to still generate a lot more vulnerability for the reserve base producers or the borrowers relative to where we saw the commodity price last year can you help me spur that again stacy c kymes a executive vice presidentcorporate banking bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2020 yeah i think the piece that youre missing is total debt so the common denominator in the increase in bankruptcies is largely unsecured capital market style debt that they cant roll or refinance not nearly as much on the senior secured lending related to the revolver weve got borrowers who are in or contemplating bankruptcy who we would expect to be able to leave on accrual because the issue is not the bank debt the issue is the unsecured bond debt or debt outside of the bank facility that they cant refinance or repay and so youre having a restructure that happens around those bondholders becoming the equity holder and having to go through a bankruptcy process to do that i think thats the link that in your analysis is not as prevalent as probably it should be gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our questionandanswer session ill turn the floor back to mr nell for any final comments steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you thanks again everyone for joining us today if you
