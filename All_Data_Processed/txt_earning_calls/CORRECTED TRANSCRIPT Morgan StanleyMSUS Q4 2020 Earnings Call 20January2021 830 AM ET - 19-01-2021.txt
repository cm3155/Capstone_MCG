morning everyone thank you for joining us and i fully appreciate were competing with a historic day here so particularly appreciate you listening in we will be brisk as we always try to be morgan stanley delivered record results in we generated an rotce of while meaningfully driving our strategic vision forward we successfully closed our acquisition of etrade received an upgrade from moodys to a2 were placed on review for upgrade a second time and announced our intent to acquire eaton vance then last month following the federal reserves release of its second stress test results we announced a billion buyback program that we intend to execute in our performance and competitive position serve as hard evidence that morgan stanley has reached an inflection point jon will discuss the details of this years performance in a moment but first let me walk you through our vision for the next decade and our focus on growth as outlined in our annual strategic update this is something weve now done since i believe lets turn to slide our strategy revolves around demonstrating stability in times of serious stress and delivering strong results when markets are active for sure tested this thesis in a rapidly evolving operating environment we responded to heightened volatility and supported open and functioning markets and client needs we delivered record revenues of billion while remaining disciplined in our risk management those revenues by the way are up from billion in the time period through turn to slide number we enhanced our positioning in areas of secular growth for several strategic acquisitions in as you know we advanced our workplace offering with the acquisition of solium and in we took a leap forward when we announced our acquisitions of etrade and eaton vance combining with etrade positions us to reach clients in various stages of wealth accumulation in a scalable economic way etrades technology products and innovation mindset enhance our growth model further etrade serves the younger demographic who are on average over years younger than those weve historically served and we can continue to service as their needs become increasingly complex with eaton vance we will create a leading asset manager of scale eaton vance brings new investment capabilities to our platform and leading positions in secular growth areas particularly customization and sustainability the deal will also expand our client reach combining msims robust international distribution with eaton vances strong us distribution please turn to slide number having experienced periods of fragility healing and stability our firm is now at an inflection point the next decade will be characterized by growth our growth drivers span across all three of our business segments well focus on gaining market share expanding and deepening our client relationships realizing acquisition synergies and operating leverage and finally returning capital to our shareholders please turn to slide scale and our interconnected businesses are the foundation for our first growth driver gaining market share our integrated investment bank produced billion in revenue on a pro forma basis our wealth and asset management platform is among the largest globally with over trillion in combined assets our breadth and depth of product offerings and services have enabled us to gain an increased share of client wallet as you can see on slide our segments are working together to deliver holistic client coverage and are capturing asset and revenue growth in international securities generated over million of revenues from transactions through wealth management referrals wealth management in turn gained billion of client assets and investment management saw billion of net flows and commitments all from institutional securities referrals morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 our second growth driver expanding and deepening our client base begins with institutional securities on slide our integrated investment bank benefits from our coordinated and clientfocused approach we built revenues meaningfully to a record billion in the result of this growth coupled with risk and expense discipline was an operating margin of turn to slide which talks about our wealth management business with the acquisition of etrade we are now a top three player in each of the key channels in which investors manage their finances and each presents unique growth opportunities with our increased capabilities we can deepen client relationships and provide more services to millions of households if we look at etrade on slide youll see the business had a remarkable year in setting new records across all material metrics the unique backdrop dramatically accelerated digital adoption and meaningfully increased levels of engagement versus prior records trading activity more than tripled and net new assets more than doubled deposits reached record levels extraordinary growth versus prior records is hard additional evidence that our decision to buy etrade was indeed the right one on slide we illustrate our extraordinary accumulation of net new assets bringing over billion of assets this year new to our firm thats of beginning period assets on a pro forma basis weve invested heavily over the years building our modern wealth strategy enhancing our technology and building new businesses and the addition of etrade will only help this years net new asset growth was remarkable and while net new assets tend to fluctuate obviously in any year and this was likely the high end of what is the likely range we still expect net new assets to remain well above historic levels on slide every year for the past decade our revenues have increased and with etrade our daily revenues will be significantly higher in the future in of trading days saw revenues in excess of million that was compared to just only four years ago lets talk about investment management on slide with our announcement to acquire eaton vance we will create a premier global asset manager with trillion in assets under management since morgan stanley investment management has grown assets under management by over billion and both msim and eaton vance have each individually attracted industryleading longterm net flows over we are really excited about this transaction and the integration planning is going well eaton vances businesses remain strong with increasing assets under management through the end of december we expect to close the transaction no later than early in the second quarter slide shows the power of our wealth and investment management platforms when taken together on a pro forma basis we will have over trillion in client assets creating further revenue opportunities our efforts to enhance and build out these businesses have led to strong growth pro forma client assets are more than double the amount we oversaw in consistent with our predominantly advicedriven business model revenue on these assets expressed in basis points on the righthand side of the page is materially higher than our three larger competitors now lets turn to slide which includes an update on the acquisition synergies we expect to realize the cost synergies we previously outlined are definitely on track and on the funding side with the additional liquidity in deposits weve added since the announcement we expect million more in synergies than originally morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 projected we also expect to capture significant incremental revenue opportunities through these deals and theyre outlined in a little bit of detail down the righthand side of this slide so turning to expense discipline is a fundamental tenet of the way we manage morgan stanley and has enhanced record pretax profits and you see our efficiency ratio has come down from at to just under this past year and obviously that has driven the pretax profit expansion so our fifth growth driver is highlighted on page over the past several years we have consistently improved our returns despite holding material excess capital were excited about the opportunity to return that excess to shareholders and announced a billion buyback program for this year we restarted our share repurchase program this month and plan to increase our dividend when restrictions are lifted by the federal reserve ill now conclude with our updated strategic objectives which are shown on slide while this year will be a transition year as we absorb two major acquisitions our focus remains on positioning morgan stanley to achieve our longterm strategic targets our longterm aspiration and frankly our belief is that wealth management will generate a margin over by and in that period we expect to range from to as we continue to work through the etrade integration we also plan to invest in many aspects of our business for growth but will balance this with discipline in so doing were keeping our longterm efficiency ratio below and within the range to over the next two years finally our longterm aspiration for rotce is indeed to exceed how quickly that occurs depends not only on our business performance but also of course on capital distribution in the meantime we raised our twoyear target to the range of to as always these targets are subject to major moves in the economic outlook and any big changes in the political and regulatory environment however based on what we see now we fully expect to achieve these as stated that concludes the strategic part of the conversation ill now turn the call over to jon who is going to go through the fourth quarter and annual results and then together we look forward to taking your questions thank you jonathan m pruzan chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in records both with and without etrade we saw continued momentum into the fourth quarter with revenues of billion dynamic markets incredible volatility and consistent client engagement across all three businesses drove results excluding etrade integrationrelated expenses our rotce was and for the fourth quarter and full year respectively and eps was and respectively we continued to deliver on operating leverage in led by institutional securities noncompensation expenses for the year increased driven by increased volumerelated expenses and higher credit provisions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development compensation expenses increased on a full year basis on higher revenues revenues for the full year were up resulting in efficiency ratio of down from in now to the businesses in institutional securities our business achieved various records throughout the full year our revenues were billion higher than our previous best year while all regions contributed to the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 results growth in asia was a standout revenues were billion in the quarter marking the strongest fourth quarter in more than years the traditional seasonal slowdown was not experienced and clients remained active up until the week of christmas investment banking revenues were billion for the full year higher than driven by record underwriting revenues particularly equity in response to the covid environment the year saw a rolling opening of markets beginning with debt and rescue financing next with equity and very recently leveraged loans and corporate ma financing quarterly results were the strongest in over a decade generating revenues of billion higher versus the prior year driven by record underwriting and advisory results with each region contributing revenues well above average run rates overall the investment banking pipeline continues to be healthy across products the pace of ma announcements has accelerated and client and boardroom dialogue is active equity issuance remains robust with a strong backlog from ipos driven by leadership in health care and technology and followon activity notably in the americas and asia after a recordbreaking year in investment grade and high yield debt markets strategic activity should support increased acquisitionrelated financing in equity sales and trading we remain number one globally for the seventh consecutive year full year revenues of billion increased from the prior period this represents the strongest annual result in over a decade this years market backdrop was unprecedented and the strong performance across products reflected heightened client activity amidst elevated volatility and a doubledigit increase in global market volume fourth quarter revenues of billion and full year results were robust across products and regions with the biggest growth drivers from derivatives and asia fixed income sales and trading revenues were the highest in over a decade increasing to billion for the year clients were highly engaged in a year marked by higher volumes and volatility active capital markets and wider bidask spreads fourth quarter revenues of billion increased yearoveryear results in the quarter and full year were led by credit and foreign exchange for the full year asia showed particular strength across other sales and trading and other revenues results this quarter improved versus the prior year the increase primarily reflected lower provisions for loan losses and movements related to deferred cash compensation plans our isg credit portfolio continues to perform well over of our isg loans and commitments are investment grade or secured isg loans and lending commitments are up billion this quarter as we continue to support our clients while our funded ratio on our corporate book has continued to decline and is now close to prepandemic levels after building our allowance for loan losses throughout the first three quarters it was essentially flat in q4 isg provisions were million while net chargeoffs were approximately million primarily related to one commercial real estate loan secured by a hotel while risk remains concentrated in our vulnerable sector portfolio the portfolio continues to decline we derisked this portfolio by close to billion this quarter and it now represents less than of our portfolio over of this portfolio like our entire isg portfolio is either investment grade or secured our reserve coverage remains stable and forbearance for the isg portfolio continues to decline turning to wealth management on october we closed our acquisition of etrade this quarters results include the combined business financials with virtually all of the etrade revenues in transactional and nii making comparisons to prior periods are difficult so i will focus my comments on q4 and how we are positioned morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 for we have also included some new disclosure in the supplement on page regarding the combined business in the quarter revenues were billion excluding integrationrelated expenses of million the pbt margin was and full year margin was the underlying drivers of this business remain extremely strong reflecting comprehensive capabilities and strong client engagement and activity we saw record feebased flows of billion for the year and feebased assets are now trillion we added billion of loans or growth in and loans are nearly billion asset quality continues to be excellent and loans in forbearance are under million down from approximately billion at the end of q1 deposits continue to grow and were supplemented by billion from etrade and are at billion the network generated net new assets of billion in the quarter and on a pro forma basis over billion in the year we remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain our productive advisors these underlying fundamentals and the realization of synergies position us well for the future in the quarter asset management fees were billion benefiting from higher asset levels and billion of fee based flows transaction volumes remained elevated and revenues were strong even after excluding approximately million of dcp as clients were active across both advisorled and selfdirected channels net interest income was billion in the quarter and benefited from the incremental deposits and investment portfolio that came with etrade this is a reasonable exit rate to inform and includes some purchase accounting adjustments associated with premium amortization which is approximately million a quarter this year nii will grow due to the realization of our funding synergies and lending growth with limited impact from rates on funding synergies we onboarded approximately billion of deposits that were previously swept off etrades balance sheet in the back half of q4 and we expect to onboard approximately billion in q1 as we invest these deposits and shed higher cost wholesale funding we would expect to realize of our revised higher funding benefits and nii in with the full impact of these actions reflected in q2 on lending we continue to see strong lending demand and expect approximately loan growth to benefit nii lastly on rates we do not anticipate any change to policy rates in the near term however we will benefit from the eventual normalization of rates the acquisition of etrade increases our us bank sensitivity to rates and a basis point increase in rates would now contribute an estimated billion of additional nii compared to the estimated billion we disclosed in our q prior to completing the acquisition we continue to expect million of integration costs over three years with approximately to be realized this year following the close of the transaction we took actions to realize the million of cost synergies we outlined our efforts have been aimed at limiting disruption to the customer experience during the integration and will be measured in we will be exiting the etrade branches consolidating our bank entities and integrating hr and finance systems and we would expect to realize approximately of the cost synergies during the year investment management reported revenues of billion in the fourth quarter representing the second highest quarterly level in over a decade for the full year revenues were billion in line with the prior period but reflecting a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenues and less from carried interest morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 total aum rose to a record high of billion of which longterm aum was also a record at billion long term net flows were billion in the quarter our global equity strategies continue to deliver strong performance and attract positive flows total net flows were billion the global nature of our platform remains an advantage as inflows across regions led to record longterm net flows of billion for the year and an annual longterm growth rate of we are excited about the transaction with eaton vance across businesses and strategies eaton vances assets under management increased by over billion since october the overall tone of the business is strong and their momentum continues turning to the balance sheet total spot assets were trillion and standardized rwas increased to billion reflecting high levels of client activity and the closing of etrade our standardized cet1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at our tax rates were and for the quarter and full year respectively we expect our tax rate to be in and around which will exhibit some quartertoquarter volatility we are pleased with our strong performance this year our franchise is better positioned for growth than we have been in well over a decade we enter with strong asset levels healthy pipelines engaged institutional and retail clients and an extremely strong brand we are confident in our ability to deliver on our objectives with that we will now open the line to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from brendan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to start on the net new asset disclosure that you guys provided here this quarter for the first time thanks for that its very very helpful it seems as though the net new asset growth the organic growth profile and the wealth business accelerated here in what do you think is driving that is that a capturing a greater wallet share of existing clients is that the expansion of the client base and it seems as though the metric excludes fees and commissions do you have an estimate of what that would mean for a headwind to that growth rate because i believe most of the other competitors disclose it net of those fees so just want to try and make it like for like thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well let me start and jon will talk about some of the disclosure stuff and as you point out brennan its the first time i think weve done it in many many years and we just thought it was time to reflect the fact that the business has unbelievable growth i mean we hear about a lot of competitors and a lot of digital players with frankly in absolute dollars modest assets and we were able to bring in billion in a year morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 now part of that is obviously its pro forma basis part of that is if you look at what etrade is doing theyre doing great part of it is if youre a net attrition of financial advisor you will be a net attrition of assets on those advisors books for the first time in 20plus years ive been doing this were not in net attrition which is interesting given the ifa channels continue to grow but theyre not growing from us so were keeping assets of our advisors were gaining assets from new advisors through the workplace initiatives through solium and etrade were gaining assets from the conversion and keeping those assets at a higher rate than we were so its a whole variety of things that have been done within the wealth management business to look for ways to continue to accelerate our client asset growth at the firm and its not a single thing i do think thats as ive used the expression before its a sporty number but its a long way from the or the we were operating at and i think it will be elevated i dont think were going to go back to but maybe that feels high certainly best in class to what the street offers but maybe jon has more on the disclosures jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah so the two critical exposures the net new assets and then the feebased flows and you can see from the footnotes on the net new assets which is a concept of the assets that we bring into the organization net of the outflows that does not exclude the fees you can figure see the fees on the asset base line in the disclosure about billion or billion the feebased flows do exclude that as a function about how much feebased assets that we have that are generating a return on those asset base hopefully that clarifies the question i think for us the net new assets given the different business models across the different business models it reflects most people dont have the level of assetbased fees that we do and we thought it was appropriate to disclose that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no thats great thats very helpful clarification and agree the growth rate looks robust i mean you regularly hear about how the traditional wealth management firms are just the providers of share and certainly a midsingle digit growth rate does not suggest youre providing or ceding share to anybody so agreed there and then for my followup sort of a related question one of the things that a lot of people and myself included think is one of the more exciting opportunities for growth in the wealth business is the stock plan business where you really just have such a strong position competitively and you flag a lot of that in the deck which is really helpful you talk about the retention opportunity the 15plus which is what etrade has pointed to historically whats the plan to integrate the stock plan platforms how long do you think that might take and is it right when we think about the opportunity set youve got the billion of unvested assets my guess is thats the opportunity set about how much of that tends to vest per year is it about a quarter or and its right to think about that as evergreen right like invest and then theyre replaced with new awards in subsequent year sorry about the multipart question but i think its important thank you jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thats okay so we have integrated the sales team were going to market to our corporate clients with a consolidated sales effort as you would expect were going to be very mindful of the integration of these platforms i would highlight that there was certainly different emphasis in terms of big companies small morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 companies private companies and we will converge those platforms over time and upgrade them both to sort of bring the best of both of those platforms together youre right the existing opportunity is the billion of unvested assets and roughly million participants our expectation is we will continue to grow the number of corporate relationships we have and therefore the number of participants and weve seen good closure rates since announcing both the solium transaction and the etrade transaction so we feel very good about the momentum of the number of new corporate relationships we have in that channel and then lastly on the billion give or take or of that vests each year i think thats a pretax number so clearly theres tax impacting that but as you say our expectation is that number will continue to grow as we bring on more and more corporate relationships brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well you clearly gained share this quarter the year in capital markets and trading aside from your gaining share what is your outlook for the industry wallet as you know it shrunk in trading for a decade and now it may or may not have turned more permanently so some banks say were planning for levels for trading some think it can maintain this pace some say its in between kind of where do you fall out and why what do you see as the structural changes james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley mike its very difficult to say i mean just look at what weve been through in the last months and look at activity in the first quarter versus the second quarter and then where the year finished so clearly there is a lot of activity in the market there is enormous fiscal stimulus rates remain very low i think the global economies are recovering and i think the vaccine if we get in the us to million doses a day for the next days would be spectacular so there are a lot of industries that are continuing to look at share issuance new ipos coming recapitalizations of different kinds raising debt so theres a lot of market activity i think in the reasonable near term whether it is at the level of i mean youd have to bet against that just on pure odds less than i think but who knows the year has started off strong and we count them one day at a time and the years started off strong the markets are active the economies are recovering globally the new administration has come in it looks like we had a peaceful transition hopefully today so im quite optimistic about it i cant put a pin to say exactly where were going to end up but were clearly gaining share our fixed income franchise has well recovered from the restructuring and lows our equities bounced and retained their number one spot again in what has been a growing equity fee pool and clearly with the banking revenues above billion for the quarter theres a lot of ma activity and a lot of underwriting activity so im pretty optimistic i morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 mean i cant put an exact number on it but i certainly dont feel like were going to make a major back step at all here mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc on that last comment in terms of backlogs are they up quarteroverquarter near record down jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley generally i think from my comments mike we describe them as healthy across all products and all regions with ipos as a standout as i said ma activity dialogue is very active pipeline very healthy so as james said a very constructive start to the year with very healthy pipeline mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from christian bolu with autonomous your line is now open christian bolu q analyst autonomous thank you and good morning james and jon maybe back on wealth management organic growth and again echo the earlier comments really appreciate the new information but james you seem to be really playing down the this year as not sustainable so i guess can you just maybe help us understand what exactly was elevated in was it just overall industry was elevated was there something more specific to morgan stanley like higher recruiting im just trying to understand why you think it was elevated and then maybe more importantly just looking forward give us a sense of what you think the business can do sustainably a sort of range for organic growth that you would expect for the business thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley christian you probably know me well enough by now to know im not going to project a trend line based upon one point of data listen weve had a decade of been growing net new assets around trillion and clearly etrade has a fastgrowing asset growth capability that adds enormously i think net positive financial advisor our actual numbers of financial advisors went up this quarter i think for the first time for years so i just trend to the conservative until i see more data and do i think its going to fall back to not at all but if we could lock in for the next years and well be bringing were bringing in billion a year i read about a lot of these online players whove got billion in total and we bring in billion every five weeks so were effectively creating these companies every five weeks now if its going to be i dont know my instinct is on trillion is a lot of assets to bring in and i think its doable im not saying its not doable but im not predicting that and i wouldnt want to guide to you that on the other hand i dont think were going back to where i think weve got a different kind of company the reason the title of this presentation is called morgan stanley at an inflection point the next decade of growth is morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 if theres one message i would like people to take away from it is were in the growth phase of this company for the next decade weve been in as we said from the crisis forward sort of fragility then healing then stability and we are unambiguously in a growth phase we have the capital to invest in our businesses were gaining share across our businesses weve got scale in the key businesses weve invested in a lot of technology improvements to the businesses to increase their efficiency and i believe were in a growth phase in this company and one of those indicators of growth will be very strong net new asset growth christian bolu q analyst autonomous fair enough maybe switching over to capital with the stock now trading well above book value how are you thinking about prioritizing buybacks versus dividends i think in the past you have spoken to an aspirational target of paying out all of wealth and asset management earnings as a dividend so maybe just some updated thoughts around how youre thinking about that prospect and again buyback versus dividend conversation here james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well the third leg to that conversation a very important leg is investing in the business if were going to grow lets pretend were growing i dont know net earnings of billion and were paying out dividends at the moment of about billion so if we were doing a buyback this year of billion were only eating into our buffer billion a year were not going to chip away at it much were at and i think our threshold is im looking at jon jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yes james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley lets assume we carry what a basis point buffer on our scbs so lets assume we want to run at were at weve clearly got some room to move obviously weve got the eaton vance move coming in which affects those numbers about basis points so as i think about it ive described this before half our company has that sort of yield component to it very stable revenues and earnings and we could clearly move the dividend higher and will once the regulators permit that we have clearly we have the capacity on the book value yes i would actually prefer to be buying stock last year when we were at unfortunately we couldnt do that but im not troubled by buying a little over book value and i dont think we can beat well we have billion billion shares outstanding obviously through the issuance from the deal so id like to get us back to billion type range over the next few years and weve got this capital there arent enough things we can invest billion billion a year in the business and generate the kinds of returns we expect to generate so its a mix of all three but clearly we like to see more action on the dividend clearly were going to be aggressively buying back and consistently and clearly we have capacity to increase our investment in the core businesses christian bolu q analyst autonomous great highclass problem thank you morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open your line is muted steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi sorry can you hear me james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yes steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc my apologies for that i just want to start off with a question on funding and nii appreciate the disclosure on funding optimization and the drivers of some of the improved synergies from the initial guidance now curious how much room there is to cut deposit costs further it looks like your wealth management deposit costs up bps its just running well above peers and just a clarifying question regarding the nii guidance jon is the growth youre contemplating in is that versus the base which reflects the full impact of the deal or is that a guide versus full year jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley ill do the first the last question first which is that it was based on the fourth quarter so sort of using a fourth quarter annualized is the right basis to be thinking about plus again we did have the full impact of both the transaction for the full quarter as well as the amortization of the premium from the investment portfolio youre right our deposit costs were basis points which were down basis points for the quarter we also saw an improvement as you know bdp or what we call our sweep deposits obviously at a lower rate basically basis points relative to our wholesale that cost about basis points so part of the funding synergies is really coming from replacing those wholesale funding cds and other wholesale funding with the offbalance sheet deposits that were going to bring back on the balance sheet so we started the quarter i think about of our funding in the deposits were sweep were now at we would expect about billion to billion of cd rolloff thats obviously based on the maturities so we continue to think that we can drive our average deposit costs lower as we continue to replace the wholesale with the incremental deposits from etrade steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats great and just for my followup a big picture question james if youll indulge me and i was hoping you could help us reconcile versus your prior target of to rotce what rate market and capital assumptions are underpinning your 17plus ambition and i guess if we start to think about the inflection in growth that you cited and maybe even sort of tailwinds from normalization just higher rates which should be more than basis point benefit greater realization of revenue synergy opportunities further progress on the scb the direction of travel there has been quite favorable the 17plus longer term still feels somewhat conservative morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 im wondering from your perspective do you see even an upper teens or a 20plus rotce as a reasonable longterm ambition just given the significant transformation thats underway james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley youre beginning to replace mike mayo he usually asks me that what about the plus whats wrong with plus plus means more steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc you can drive a truck through that range james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah listen i wouldnt put i wouldnt try and model too much science into this this is an expression of our aspiration and as i said also happens to be our belief its not just disneyland we believe we will deliver these numbers and for some of the reasons you listed rates being one of them obviously has a huge impact on the term but look at where we finished last year and what our numbers were these obviously become very plausible whether it should be 17plus 18plus 19plus listen if we said to you three years ago our aspiration was to have a 17plus rotce you would have thought we were off the planet so im very comfortable with these numbers if we could achieve this then obviously the stock should be trading much higher than it is today and embedded in it we do do some math we start with our budget we start with our operating performance in we look at our budget projections we do sensitivities around revenues we understand what our comp and non comp look like over the next couple of years whether we have major litigation exposures or not the integration costs that we have got to work through and then the synergies of the various businesses and then we of course look at the capital question which i discussed earlier i think with christian on buyback dividend or reinvestment in the business and what our rwa growth is going to be in isg and how that affects the cet1 and you put all of that in a big washing machine and out spits a number with a plus on it operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thanks very much james i wonder if we could look at slide and talk to something that comes up a bunch you show your trillion pro forma if you look at that fee rate theres only one other peer on that top that has a fee rate equal or better than yours and i think its a good thing but this comes up plenty so i would love to hear you talk about it and the sustainability of that fee rate i dont see price pressure in the wealth management business but people ask on it all the time just curious to get your thought process over the coming years and whats kind of embedded in those your medium and longterm targets implicitly with that thanks james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i dont think youre going to see price compression of any significance across the wealth or asset management platforms its really a function glenn of asset type so for example the wealthier the client if you have clients morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 with million theyre not paying basis points theyre probably paying i dont know close to basis points or something a client worth million is paying closer to basis points so it depends a little bit on the business mix as to what revenue you generate on those assets obviously some of the etrade active trading clients have got higher velocity on them theyre going to have higher basis point numbers and a very passive position in restricted stock so a little bit of that is youve got to sort of peel away whats going on under the numbers but to your broader question do i see price compression across wealth management no i dont in fact we will probably generate more revenue as we build up the banking and the banking lending and deposit products on the asset management side i mean listen if youre driving performance in the active side you can generate you can hold your fees as they are if the underperformers lose their assets quick then they lose their fees so im not terribly bothered about it if you knew the names of the three above us you would probably guess them theres a reason theyre more indexoriented its a different business model now we generate a higher revenue per dollar of asset but we pay a higher revenue comp structure per dollar of asset so its not exactly a basis point basis point win as you know obviously glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc understood understood wanted to hear your words thanks and then maybe if we could just bridge the gap i think i know the answer to this too but this is a pretty strong environment you consolidated etrade the adjusted margin in wealth management of of the mediumterm target the twoyear target of to how do we get inside the range without the help of rates because the fed theoretically is on hold for a few years james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well yeah the business is growing we had some additional expenses this year for example we made more contributions to our overall philanthropic and charitable efforts given whats going on with covid that cost is distributed across the businesses we paid a onetime bonus to all employees earning less than i think who dont receive bonuses given the head count in wealth management that disproportionately affects that business so theres always a few things going on that point of margin is worth about million a quarter i think if im doing my math right billion million so something like that so its not small numbers could move it around a point or two but i think with increased growth increased efficiency better conversion of the assets more asset flows in generating this average basis points is how you bounce between the sort of what did we say to range to im sorry to and depending on the environment i mean weve started the year strong that probably helps point if that held up there you go operator thank you our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 thanks good morning first question just want to come back to some of the questions on organic growth and i like the slide that shows the trillion in assets held away essentially making the point that you already have the customer reach and so just trying to think about whether you view kind of all of that as potential wallet that you can go after or said another way are there any products that maybe dont line up in that trillion and then as the firm becomes more connected through technology which i think you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years how do you think about your strategies to connect with a greater percentage of that call it trillion i know every business has a little bit different call it sales process but are there new strategies or even financial incentives that you can think about to really accelerate the penetration into that jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure ill give that a crack were not naive we dont expect to have of the wallet of all of our clients so clearly we dont expect to bring in all trillion over time but theres significant overlap as you note in these channels and in these wealth figures we continue as you saw through the net new assets as james mentioned a lot of that was from existing customers consolidating their assets a lot of that is being driven by the technology that weve made and the investments that weve made in the platform that help our advisors advise their clients and weve seen people bring in more assets so i think if you think about the opportunity set i think we tried to line it up pretty well through the different channels on the workplace i think its really around retaining cash and retaining vested assets and then over time growing the relationships selfdirected at a minimum weve seen people leaving the etrade platform as their needs got more sophisticated and they needed advice were clearly going to capture the top part of the funnel with our fas with the faled model that we have so again a real opportunity and i like the way you described it just look at the numbers million households almost million participants in million households the breadth and reach of the platform is quite large and there is some overlap there but its still over million clients that we can provide incremental services or bring in more assets from in terms of connectivity as you could imagine we are collecting and analyzing data and working with our clients to try to figure out incremental needs and services and products that they need with the etrade acquisition we bring on incremental digital capabilities and as you can imagine this year were spending the year trying to figure out and piloting ways that we can work better and more efficiently with our clients were going to pilot around lead generation weve defined the advisor group whos going to work with new clients weve got scoring systems weve got artificial intelligence trying to help predict what people are going to want need and next best action so its really a culmination of all the investments that we made plus the digital from wealth and were going to use this year to try to get a very good understanding of our client base with these pilots and how we can provide incremental services going forward devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific thanks jon just a followup here just on the core expense structure and trying to think about some of the benefits of with the pandemic that were deflationary were seeing that as some of those benefits roll off theres some inflationary aspects into kind of on a core basis but longer term obviously i think weve learned a lot about the businesses through the past months and opportunities potentially to drive some longerterm savings or maybe core deflation in the expense structure so im just would love to get some morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 thoughts around how you guys are thinking about areas or opportunities to maybe drive more expenses out of the system based on what youve learned over the last months jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i would say were still learning crisis is not over we clearly are hopeful around the rollout of the vaccine i think there are going to be some takeaways around some of the digital client experiences that weve been able to do the work from home that weve been able to do but i think its a little early to start making those decisions lets get through the crisis first operator thank you our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning and thanks for taking the questions the strategic update and growth outlook are always helpful just on the efficiency ratio given the level in and you realized strong revenues in this environment but with etrade and eaton vance operating at a better ratio i think the longerterm wealth management margin improving maybe basis points just what drives the conservative outlook like are there areas that you want to invest significantly to continue to drive the growth or are there areas for potential improvement on that level james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah listen i think we said under after two years so i dont think thats conservative mike we were at just a few years ago and i think when i started we were much higher so the longterm position is well run this place with a margin plus what happens in the next two years with the bouncing around the markets i dont know maybe were too conservative in the short run but it doesnt change our behavior i guess is what i would tell you we are very determined to drive this company for growth and for efficiency and for returns thats been unambiguous for a decade now so it doesnt change our behavior at all its just what do we think as reasonable people you should expect at a minimum to achieve in this time period and thats what we try and to put in the twoyear period the longer term were much more aggressive but we deal with reality of two years this year as i said if you annualize the way this year started off well do better than the efficiency range michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc yeah no that makes sense and jon just one clarification on the wealth management you gave a lot of numbers on the outlook just given the etrade deal i just wanted to clarify on the funding benefit did you say in and most of that by and then same thing on the expense synergies i heard a and so i just wanted to make sure i had the right number just in terms of what youre recognizing in thanks jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i think all those numbers that you gave are correct the funding synergies are really from this transition from the offbalance sheet the onbalance sheet and the runoff of the wholesale deposits so again that skews morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 more towards the back half and the when you get into the second quarter youll be using a quarter number not a full year benefit number and then on costs and approximately on the integration costs as well so yes those are the right numbers michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from jeremy sigee with bnp paribas your line is now open if your line is muted please unmute jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas sorry apologies for that i thought the comments on net interest income outlook in wealth management were very helpful and i just wondered if i could get you to talk in a similar way about the asset management fees and the transaction revenues in wealth management because versus my estimates i thought asset management was a bit below maybe thats a lag with the rising aum but obviously transaction revenues were very strong so could you talk about those two revenue drivers within wealth management please jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure on the asset management fee line obviously the exit rate as you know we get to benefit now for the full year of the trillion in feebased assets you have averaging effect and exit effect in terms of so now at the trillion assets well also have the benefit of the net new assets that we bring in over though on an average basis we would expect continued growth obviously in that line we had over growth yearoveryear in that asset management fees and then on transactional its really going to be around client engagement and client activity levels fourth quarter we benefited from elevated transactional i did say that that was helped by the dcp number which presumably may or may not repeat next year but the margin on that revenue as weve talked about in the past is virtually zero and so transactional generally has been declining we now have the etrade platform inside of morgan stanley so the commissions based on their options trading as well as some of the flow dynamics will aid that number so well be at a new level but generally that is going to be driven by volumerelated activity and well have to see how it plays out recognizing the first days have been pretty good jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thank you and just a followup on the acquisition expenses you sort of break out the amount of acquisition related expenses in here i just wondered if you could talk to us about the split between sort of restructuring and amortization of intangibles you said youre going to be amortizing the intangibles im just wondering about the amount of that and where we see it jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 sure why dont i just give you a few so again we issued billion of equity or about million shares we generated billion of goodwill and intangibles youll see that in the first couple of pages of the supplement of that goodwill and intangibles about billion is going to be amortized at a rough rate of about years so about million and that would be allocated in the noncomps in the wealth segment operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global securities your line is now open james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning maybe we could talk a little about the momentum at etrade i just want to confirm the numbers if i looked at their second quarter sort of retail client base is around million selfdirected clients and then i think at december the fourth quarter it was up to million are those applestoapples and if so that implies quite a bit of net new account growth of close to thats pretty good momentum just maybe you could discuss whats driving that and how you feel about that going forward jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i think we tried to lay that out as i said on page you can see what preclosing so the september number shows selfdirected assets within morgan stanley before the deal closed so yes the growth has really been in the etrade channels your number of about is accurate again i think from our disclosure going forward we had to conform sort of definitions and whatnot but theyve had real strong growth with new clients given the activity levels this year its a number youll be able to track whether the selfdirected channel is growing through that number going forward i dont think were going to be explicitly disclosing net new clients within the selfdirected channel as we try to integrate and bring these two businesses together james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay i imagine thats better growth than you anticipated does that give you even more confidence in the revenue synergies from etrade james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yes and yes james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay great thanks operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank you for participating you may now
