everyone thanks for joining our call today we continue to execute well through the second quarter driving forward on key initiatives in both consumer and commercial accelerating our digital transformation making steady progress on top and announcing the acquisition of hsbcs east coast branches and online bank the diversity and resilience of our business model was evident as record revenue in capital markets and wealth partially offset a sizable drop in mortgage our credit results continue to be excellent given further improvement in the economy the headline numbers for the quarter with eps of and rotce of were flattered by a sizeable reserve release importantly we feel ppnr has now bottomed and growth should resume in the second half we achieved average loan growth in the quarter a little less than projected as pay downs on ppp loans and across the backbook in commercial offset generally good levels of originations we did a nice job on expenses protecting the areas aligned with our growth initiatives while delivering on our expense efficiencies associated with top looking out to the second half we believe we will see a pickup in loan growth particularly on the consumer side in student pointofsale finance and auto in commercial we should start to see gradual growth in line utilization off of low levels along with a pickup in dealrelated financings mortgage revenues should rebound modestly given hedge losses in q2 and generally strong production while capital markets pipelines remain healthy we citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 expect a return to positive operating leverage in both q3 and q4 credit should continue to be excellent we are now calling for further improvement in chargeoffs to to basis points in the third quarter and to basis points for the full year we continue to feel good about our progress and our ability to come out of the pandemic period with increasing differentiation and growth in franchise value versus our peers over time with that ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone let me start with the headlines for the quarter weve reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was which includes the impact of a sizable credit provision benefit revenue of billion was down slightly linkedquarter on lower mortgage fee income with net interest income up slightly given interestearning asset growth average loans were up in the quarter on the strength of retail originations hitting an alltime high giving us good momentum heading into the second half of the year these highlights include record results in capital markets and wealth mortgage fees were lower as margins continue to tighten although origination volumes remain quite strong and we continue to control expenses down quarteroverquarter we recorded a credit provision benefit of million which reflects sustained macroeconomic improvement and strong credit performance with lower chargeoffs our acl ratio is now at excluding ppp loans and finally we are in a very strong capital position with cet1 at after returning million to shareholders in dividends during the quarter we also continue to grow our tangible book value per share which was at quarterend up compared with the year ago next ill refer to a few slides and give you some key takeaways for the second quarter ill then outline our outlook for the third quarter net interest income on slide was up linkedquarter given interestearning asset growth and higher day count average loans were up and net interest margin was down slightly the net interest margin reflects lower earningasset yields reflecting the low rate environment spread pressures and elevated lending competition although improved funding mix and better deposit pricing are helping to mitigate these factors the interestbearing deposit costs improved basis points to basis points from continued discipline on deposit pricing our asset sensitivity increased to about from at the end of the first quarter the increase primarily reflects the ongoing stability in deposit levels and the improvement in funding mix given the increase in low cost deposits referring to slide we delivered solid fee results again this quarter with record results in capital markets and wealth reflecting the ongoing investments in our capabilities and the benefit of acquisitions mortgage fees were down approximately million this quarter as production revenue was impacted by continued pressure on gain on sale margins particularly in the wholesale and correspondent channels given increased industry capacity and competitive pressures citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 while we had expected a meaningful decline in mortgage revenue for the quarter it ended up greater than expected due to two items that reduced our revenue by a combined million the first was the million of msr valuation losses net of hedges driven by changes in implied rate volatility which moved unexpectedly near the end of the quarter also we were impacted by a million increase in linkedquarter to mortgage agency fees retroactively applied to existing pipelines we would not expect these impacts to recur in q3 secondary originations remained strong but were down about from first quarter levels as expected we are seeing a continuing shift towards purchase originations which increased from about of the total in first quarter to about in the second quarter also our thirdparty servicing book grew to million up linked quarter and yearoveryear and servicing contribution improved million linkedquarter moving on to some of our positive quarteroverquarter fee contributors we delivered record results from capital markets and wealth reflecting our ongoing investments in capabilities and demonstrating diversity in our fee income capital markets fees hit another high of linkedquarter with loan syndication fees hitting their highest levels since our ma pipeline continues to be strong at historic highs additionally wealth fees had a new record up linkedquarter reflecting an increase in assets under management from net inflows with record sales and strong market levels finally card fees results were strong up linkedquarter as debit transactions and credit card spend rebounded to exceed prepandemic levels given the strength in the recovery which also benefited from seasonal strength seasonal trends on slide expenses were well controlled down linkedquarter with seasonality in salaries and employee benefits average loans on slide were up million or linkedquarter given the strength in our retail portfolio offsetting a decline in commercial diving into drivers a bit more the diversity of our retail lending business produced record high retail loan originations in the quarter which was partially offset by elevated pay downs this was driven by strengthened mortgage auto and education refinance partially offset by planned rundown of the personal unsecured portfolios commercial was roughly flat in the quarter excluding ppp we had a strong origination quarter led by asset backed and subscription line finance which had been steady contributors over the last few quarters this was offset by elevated payoff activity which reflects highly favorable conditions for commercial companies to access the debt capital markets line utilization levels stabilized near historical historic lows over the course of the quarter we saw average commitments for our middle market and midcorporate clients grow by in the second quarter after being flat in the first quarter this will benefit us as the economic activity drives corporate investment overall spot loan growth for the quarter before the impact of ppp forgiveness was given strong retail and commercial originations this provides good underlying momentum for loan growth in the second half of the year on slide deposit flows continue to be robust especially in lowcost categories and our liquidity ratios remain strong average deposits were up linkedquarter and yearoveryear with strong growth in demand deposits interestbearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline in term deposits was offset by growth in lowcost categories we are very pleased with our continued progress on deposit repricing with total deposit costs down basis points to basis points interestbearing deposit costs were down basis points to basis points during the quarter and we expect these costs to continue decreasing to lowteens or better by the end of the year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 moving on to credit on slides and we saw excellent credit results this quarter net chargeoffs dropped by more than half as they declined from basis points to basis points linkedquarter driven by improvements across the portfolio nonaccrual loans decreased million or linkedquarter with a million decrease in commercial reflecting repayments and chargeoffs retail nonaccrual loans decreased by million linked quarter driven by mortgage and home equity given the improvement in outlook and performance of the portfolio our reserves decreased ending the quarter at excluding ppp loans compared with at the end of the first quarter moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength increasing our cet1 ratio from in the first quarter to at the end of the second quarter after returning million in capital to shareholders through dividends in the quarter we paused our stock repurchases in the second quarter in anticipation of strong second half loan growth and the hsbc transaction which are expected closing in the first quarter of will use about basis points of capital we have the opportunity to resume repurchases in the second half with about million of capacity remaining under our current board authorization the pace and magnitude of repurchases will consider the strength of organic growth as well as the potential for feebased acquisitions while managing cet1 to within our target range of to before i move on for a second quarter outlook let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company on slide and i should have said ph outlook before i move on to that as bruce mentioned we are now working on further transformational efficiency opportunities to form a top program for example based on the work weve done so far we have further opportunities as we mature our agile delivery model and simplify how we operate implement the next wave of our nextgen technology program including further rationalization of applications and continue to optimize our branch density this quarter we released our 4th annual corporate responsibility report highlighting our commitment to advancing our environmental social and governance goals reflecting our core values the report provides a snapshot of our significant progress this year including the establishment of a formal corporate responsibility governance framework and the completion of our first materiality assessment to more specifically define esg priorities for example we know that it is vitally important that we help create a healthy and sustainable future and we are committed to reducing our impact on the environment therefore consistent with international accords we have set ambitious targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from operations by by and by the last item ill cover on this page is the acquisition of hsbcs east coast branches and online deposit franchise there is a recap of the transaction on slide so i wont rehash all the details other than to reiterate the attractive entry this provides us in the important new york city metro washington dc and south florida markets a sizable customer base and solid deposit franchise provide a springboard for our consumer national expansion strategy in addition the billion net deposit position provides a significant longterm funding flexibility in support of our attractive loan growth opportunities citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 and now for some high level commentary on the outlook on slide we expect nii to be up to with nim up lowtomid single digits with our outlook based on a 10year treasury rate expectation at for the third quarter we expect average loans to be up slightly in the third quarter with spot loans up about to earning assets are expected to be broadly stable in the third quarter we are wellpositioned to see overall loan growth accelerate in the second half and into particularly given the continued strength we are seeing in mortgage education refi and auto as well as the seasonal benefits expected for inschool and pointofsale lending in the third quarter in commercial we expect a slower recovery and utilization rates off historic lows with modest growth over the second half of the year led by assetbacked subscription lines and dealrelated financings fee income is expected to be up to reflecting improvement in mortgage banking results and other categories as the economic recovery continues partially offset by seasonal impacts in capital markets noninterest expense is expected to be up slightly in the third quarter we expect net chargeoffs will be in the range of to basis points of average loans with the provision less than net chargeoffs with a substantial improvement in credit we expect that net chargeoffs will be in the range of to basis points for the full year down from our prior outlook of to basis points to wrap up this was a solid quarter for citizens with good momentum heading into the back half of the year our expectation is that ppnr will grow quarterly in the second half of the year with positive operating leverage each quarter with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john operator lets open it up for qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley go ahead please ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i saw a few references to top so in your press release so i was actually hoping you could talk a little bit more about what we might expect from the new top program and also how it might differ from top thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure ken its john here yeah i mean i think as youve seen over the years its just been part of our culture to really dig in on this kind of mindset of continuous improvement and last year top was somewhat unique and its transformational sort of twoyear profile were very pleased with how that played out delivering on the expectations of million to million in run rate save so were excited about that and there was a lot of traditional kind of top contributors in top and there was the a transformational aspect to it so that made it a little bit unique i think top may bring us back to some of that foundational sort of continuous approach to driving efficiencies and a couple of areas that were looking at sort of looking at a round two some of the areas that we were able to sort of drive in top such as agile delivery and simplifying how we were operating nextgen tech has another call it next wave of rationalizing applications associated with it so i think you could see sort of a and revisiting some of the transformational areas of top but then just continuing on our bread and butter to try to simplify how we operate and fundamentals around how we manage the place and id suggest that maybe theres some more room to go on optimizing branch density but really just getting back to what we do which is driving continuous improvement yearoveryear operator pardon me your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bruce i was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your ma strategy you know obviously you just announced the hsbc brands deal and have done some few deals but there were i guess some interviews and quotes from you a few weeks back about being more open to bank deals i think so maybe just update us on your thinking there thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure so matt i think weve been very clear all along that we have some great strategic initiatives that should lead to very good organic growth for citizens and thats kind of top of the heap in terms of priorities weve focused next on feebased bolton acquisitions and with some success i think youre seeing the results in our commercial business now that weve kind of incorporated ma capabilities into our offerings to our customer base and the mortgage acquisition clearly was thoughtful and welltimed and then the wealth clarfeld acquisition has been a homerun in terms of opening up crosssell particularly to our commercial business owners so we will we are pursuing more of those and so i feel good that therell be some announcements over the course of the second half of the year in that regard so stay tuned there with respect to full bank acquisitions i think the first step here was this hsbc transaction which i think strategically makes good sense for us and also financially is very attractive and compelling and so one of the things that we like about that is that it fills in some geographical holes that we have particularly the new york metro area and pushes this down a little bit midatlantic south towards washington and then gets us a beachhead in south florida so those are all things that i think fit well with our distribution strategy and if we could find potentially other bank transactions that fit that bill that potentially could strengthen the footprint and help our distribution strategy and we can get it at the right price and its the right culture and meets the strategy et cetera with compelling financial economics wed be open to that i dont think its something that again is a driving desire here i think it will be a bit opportunistic if we can find a good deal we would certainly consider it operator well go next to the line of ken usdin with jefferies go ahead please kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys i wanted to ask on the outlook a couple of things about the nii side john last quarter you had mentioned that you expected flat earning assets and we continued to see the strong deposit growth come through and im just wondering again youre calling for flat earnings assets but looks like the deposit growth remains pretty strong for the industry and for you guys so just wondering what are you seeing there and expecting in terms of overall deposit growth and why that would only result in flattish earning assets john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 yeah i mean i think that weve been for some time now thinking that with economic activity youd start to see potentially some of those deposits to flatten out theyve just been continuing to grow and weve seen strong flows id say whats been nice about that is thats been coming in the categories we want them to show up and meeting demand deposits have been really strong underpinning all of that so thats been quite good i think the and what thats resulted in is continuing to allow us to run our deposit playbook and youre seeing our interestbearing deposit costs decline and headed towards really lowteens or even better by the end of the year so thats been great i do think that as you see economic recovery in the second half of the year we would suspect that some of that growth will begin to moderate and possibly even some of it begin to run off but we have most of that surge deposits that we saw in and early we think its going to stick around so as much as twothirds or more and then thats great fuel and great support for what we expect to see later in the year which is loan growth and as you get into lots of momentum so those are some of the thoughts i have on the deposit side bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add to that ken that the spot numbers are quite optimistic so i think we had a record level of originations for loans in the consumer side in the second quarter we had a very strong level of that in commercial which goes back to prepandemic level of originations were still seeing relatively high pay downs which mutes that a little bit but i think when we look out into q3 in particular we have a bunch of seasonal strength in businesses like student and pointofsale combined with i think those pay downs should start to moderate a little bit so were quite optimistic that well see very very strong spot loan growth that should kick in in q3 and extend into q4 the average is based on timing of when this all happens may not fully reflect that in q3 but i would stay focused on the spot number operator your next question will come from david george with baird go ahead please david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc hi thanks good morning question on ppp could you disclose the dollar amount of ppp loans in the quarter and then ive got a followup on the outlook john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean its basically at the end of the quarter the average balances during was about billion billion billion david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc okay great appreciate that and then with respect to the q3 outlook particularly specifically on fees it looks like youre expecting a fairly nice jump in fee activity and i trust part of thats going to come from mortgage john i thought i think you said million relative to q2 that is of that million number was msr related then there was a million agency fee impact was there anything else that impacted that number im just trying to get a sense as to how much of a balance youre expecting over the next quarter or two citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think yeah thats right as i mentioned in my remarks theres about million of unique items that feels unique to and so thats something thatll set us up nicely for starting with that without expecting those things to recur we do think that in the third quarter volumes will help will hold up and we may have some modest decline in gain on gain on sale margins but given whats going on with those sort of nonrecurring items from as well as still a strong volume quarter that we do think that mortgage rebounds into the third quarter operator your next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning just on the loan front i know you mentioned that youre seeing some loan competition around loan pricing so i just wondered if you can elaborate on that and what areas are you seeing it and if you could maybe give us some color in terms of your new production loan yields in the various areas that would be helpful then i have a followup on capital thanks donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah hey john its don mccree we definitely are seeing price competition in terms of competition across the board so part of the reason that our loan growth is a little bit more tepid than it might be as were trying to stay pretty disciplined on price and terms so down maybe basis points or something is what im seeing generally in terms of price spreads across the board i think just elaborating on what john and bruce have said on loan growth were out with our clients in person now which is actually quite gratifying and the thing thats kind of restricting utilization is all these supply chain backups and some of the labor and as those begin to clear particularly labor we think clears up towards the september timeframe and the supply chain begins to normalize towards the fourth quarterish we would expect more normal working capital build to resume so thats what gives me a lot of confidence and then as john said weve got about our entire downdraft in spot loan growth in the quarter was ppp repayments and thats going to begin to moderate so theres some headwinds that weve been sailing into which should clear themselves out and give us some good momentum as we move into the backend but were going to stay disciplined on terms and price and credit bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure brendan brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah similar on consumer id say exppp spot balances were up just shy of so a pretty decent growth overall despite as bruce pointed out some run down in the backbook were seeing really good strength and record originations really the highest level of originations weve had since were a public company here in q2 so citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 the momentum should continue in the second half of the year and then as both bruce and john pointed out adding an iup the apple iphone upgrade program which is typically a late summer early fall event and then the seasonality of inschool lending should really give us another round of growth heading into the second half of the year but pricing has been really competitive in a couple of fronts in particular student loan refinancing as rates had ticked up and now are starting to peel back a little bit thats been a particular place of intensity id say on assets like auto while pricing intensity has picked up a little bit spread still remain pretty high so were looking at that business still as a doubledigit roe business right now with originations which is elevated from normalized levels in auto given the short duration so were able to hit record originations in auto as an example with still somewhat elevated yields which has been really really good so im optimistic actually the last point home equity which is probably a little bit unique from what youre hearing against peers weve been really really strong in originations for home equity in fact were seeing some benchmarking that puts us in probably the top two or three lenders across the us although only operating in states right now for home equity lending this quarter the spot balances actually grew and from a quarterly basis thats the first time since the financial crisis weve seen net loan growth in home equity and our credit card book is also bottomed so some of these delevering trends with all the stimulus out there in the market with consumers i think in our line of credit products have hit the bottom or starting to see signs that those are turning so hopefully a tailwind as we look think about h2 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its great john do you want to finish up with anything or john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yeah oh sorry go ahead john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i meant john woods sorry john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible john its such a unique name yeah i mean i think you were also you were just kind of asking about yields and in the second quarter we were able to see origination yields up in the retail side of things due to a number of due to the diversity of the portfolio and we suspect that that may thats something that we may see continue into the third quarter with origination yields rising and that tends to temper the frontbook back book dynamic that i think maybe were trying to get after citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc no thats helpful thank you so much for all that and then on capital i know you saw some good strengthening in the cet1 to first if you could just maybe talk about how you think about that target of to i mean were starting to see some of your peers nudge down their targets their internal targets a bit i wanted to get your thoughts on that is there room to potentially adopt a lower level there on the cet1 internal target thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure well were comfortable with that to as you know over time we brought that down it was then it was to and then it was and its to so i think as weve matured as a company as weve demonstrated good risk discipline in how weve grown the loan book and you can see weve come through the pandemic with a low level of credit losses i think some of that new guy a little bit of conservatism we had coming off the ipo were starting to shed that and move back closer to where peer targets are so for now were above the to so i dont see any real burning desire to change it but over time certainly if the pack moves down a little bit we have plenty of room versus our scb target and certainly i think the risk profile would permit that operator your next question will come from peter winter with wedbush securities your line is open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning it doesnt i just want to ask about the swaps hedging it doesnt look like you added any swaps this quarter and im just wondering what the plan is going forward i do know rates are obviously lower im just wondering what level rates need to get to before you think maybe adding some more swaps john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we actually did add some swaps this quarter peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc oh you did john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean we added maybe call it billion or so and we added billion or so later in the quarter and actually billion right at the beginning of the quarter so really right around billion you add that to the billion we executed late in the first quarter and weve got around billion that weve added as part of our call it sort of early stage kind of dollar cost averaging into what the rate environment and when you look at the overall averages we did that call it mid to high on average which is mid to high basis points to basis points on that overall portfolio and in the five years sort of well below that today so and the last couple of billion was i think over basis citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island over basis points john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah it was over basis points so i think that weve been able to start to look opportunistically at ways to really sort of monetize some of that asset sensitivity over time and were still over actually close to asset sensitivity so theres lots of opportunity to continue to add to the swap portfolio as and when the rate environment continues to improve and our yearoveryear headwind from swap has declined significantly and markedly as a result of all these actions so i think were i think were in pretty good shape in terms of the swap portfolio operator operator instructions well go to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead please gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bruce good morning john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ive got two questions first for you john can you give us some color i noticed in your outlook you indicated that you guys think that the 10year or the expectation for the 10year will be currently today as you know its well below that if it comes in at for the quarter what will that do to the net interest margin assumptions that you have in net interest income and then second for you bruce the president obviously came out with the executive order on ma to scrutinize deals more closely does that raise the risk of your hsbc deal at all thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and knock off the first part of that gerard in terms of so weve gotten through a few weeks of the quarter where rates were a little higher we do have an expectation of an average of for the quarter if it were to drop off call it into that range maybe we would see call it millionish or so of impact to nii maybe basis point or basis points on nim but i hasten to add that there are offsets in puts and takes when youre operating in an environment like that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 more broadly you could find better opportunities in terms of offsetting that on the deposit side you could also see as weve demonstrated back in the crisis and in the pandemic the resilience of the franchise broadly even beyond the net interest income and what the downside rate protection that the mortgage company actually provides which is extremely powerful so i think that maybe theres a modest impact from a first order effect if the 10year stays down there but i think we have mitigants in terms of on the deposit side and then more broadly in the fee area bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah part two of that gerard i dont see the biden executive order impacting the hsbc transaction so thats a relatively modest in size transaction thats straightforward and in any case the eo is out for comment its going to take quite a while to settle that one down and more broadly i think bank mergers are probably amongst the most heavily scrutinized as it is so whether there is a meaningful impact down the track on that remains to be seen but certainly as it relates to the hsbc transaction i dont see any impact at all operator your next question will be from david konrad with kbw go ahead david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes good morning it sounds like definitely very positive on loan growth trends maybe more spot than average because of timing but just curious i think historically youve talked about a midsingle digit to highsingle digit full year spot loan growth i just wondered if youre still comfortable with that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think thats right i mean when you look at look at where were coming out just in the second quarter in terms of spot you can you see that that momentum thats being generated and then thats continuing into the third quarter with the to guide that we highlighted i think you absolutely could get to that and the expectation is to get to that midsingle digit range david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i think id hasten to add when you look at it excluding ppp thats an important metric to look at when youre considering the underlying fundamental flows that were seeing both in commercial and consumer and you know were bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island that was in q2 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island which annualizes to over and then the to were calling out for third quarter and that includes the math from that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island that so it will add a or more to that exppp in and so i think your bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so one of the aspects i think thats unique to us is just the number of sales we set out to catch the win when theres some win so we have a very broad lending portfolio on the consumer side and we play in some very attractive verticals on the commercial side so broadly feel good that we can certainly get to nominal gdp growth on a recurring basis operator and at this time we have no further questions in queue you may proceed bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great well thanks again for dialing in today we always appreciate your interest
