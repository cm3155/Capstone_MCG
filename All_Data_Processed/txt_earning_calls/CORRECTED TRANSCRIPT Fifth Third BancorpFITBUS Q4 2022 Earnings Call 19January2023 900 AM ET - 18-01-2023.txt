everyone to start i would like to thank our employees for the job they did supporting our customers communities and shareholders in you really held true to our core values and our vision to be the one bank people most value and trust just capital and cnbc recently released their annual study of americas most just companies a comprehensive ranking that recognizes companies who do right by all stakeholders as defined by the american public fifth third ranked 23rd out of the roughly companies covered in the study and was the highest ranked category four bank its a great achievement thank you earlier today we reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year the strength and quality of our franchise are evident in the numbers we generated record full year revenue of billion up over the prior year we managed expenses down yearoveryear producing positive operating leverage of basis points and an efficiency ratio of net chargeoffs for the year were below basis points as a result we achieved a full year return on tangible common equity exaoci of which places us in the top quartile of our peer group just as importantly we did what we said we were going to do we have a culture of accountability at fifth third and it makes me proud that our full year results exceeded the guidance we provided you last january in every major caption including total revenue expenses and net chargeoffs as a result ppnr increased compared to our original guide of we also made important progress on our growth strategies in we grew consumer households at a peer leading organic growth rate of around led by our southeast markets at and surpassed last years record for new quality relationships within our commercial segment we opened new branches in the southeast in bringing our threeyear total to over new branches in those markets during the year we also made meaningful progress in our technology modernization initiatives and enhanced our peerleading digitally enabled treasury management managed services and our momentum banking product offerings you may have seen that most recently we extended momentums early pay feature to include income tax refunds our fintech platforms dividend finance and provide continued to scale and achieved top national market shares with dividend ranking third and provide ranking second in their respective markets our feegenerating businesses are better diversified than most peers and continue to be a key focus for investment strong performance in our capital markets business related to client hedging activities mortgage servicing and treasury management all helped to offset market headwinds that all banks faced as did continued net aum inflows in our wealth management business during we remained focused on delivering stable longterm results instead of chasing shortterm earnings we maintained our discipline in our credit underwriting with continued focus on granularity and diversification the outcomes of this are evident in our npa npl and earlystage delinquency ratios all of which have remained wellbehaved and wellbelow normalized levels fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 our balance sheet management approach remained centered on providing strong and stable nii performance across various rate environments we extended our advantage in our securities yield by waiting to deploy excess liquidity until we were able to earn positive real yields and we added derivatives to provide hedge protection through these actions will provide significant longterm benefits in the event of a lower rate environment with respect to capital given our strong ppnr growth and benign credit losses we exceeded our target cet1 ratio in the fourth quarter and resumed share repurchases our capital priorities for are to maintain a cet1 ratio and support organic balance sheet growth pay a strong dividend and continue our share repurchase program we expect repurchases to steadily increase each quarter for a total of approximately billion during the year jamie will provide you with the detail on our financial outlook for but it is a strong one that is consistent with our priorities of stability profitability and organic growth we expect to produce another year of strong revenue growth and operating leverage with full year ppnr growth in the mid to high teens a return on tangible common equity exaoci exceeding and an efficiency ratio below we will continue to invest in organic growth and efficiency initiatives well add another to branches in our southeast markets including our first three in charleston south carolina and several more in the greenville spartanburg south carolina corridor well continue to increase investments in marketing and product innovation to accelerate household growth and well invest in scaling dividend and provide lastly well make significant progress on our tech modernization journey and begin to realize savings and improve the client experience by leveraging these investments to drive automation into our most laborintensive processes you have my commitment that we will continue to make decisions with the longterm in mind to invest where we can strengthen the value and resiliency of our franchise and to hold ourselves accountable for doing what we say we will do with that ill now turn it over to jamie to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our current outlook for james c leonard executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today our quarterly and full year financial performance reflect focused execution and resiliency throughout the bank we generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record revenue nii was positively impacted by higher market rates as deposit repricing has lagged the repricing of our earning assets combined with the benefits of fixed rate asset generation at higher rates fee income has remained resilient despite the marketrelated headwinds and expenses were wellcontrolled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses we achieved a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of which improved throughout the year with the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio below our fourth quarter ppnr grew compared to last quarter and compared to last year net interest income of approximately billion was a record for the bank and increased sequentially and yearoveryear our nim expanded basis points for the quarter while interestbearing core deposit costs increased basis points to basis points reflecting a cycletodate interestbearing core deposit beta of in the fourth quarter fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 total noninterest income increased sequentially driven by our tra revenue and commercial banking fees that growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by higher ma advisory revenue and client financial risk management revenue and it was partially offset by softer results in mortgage banking origination fees noninterest expense increased just compared to the yearago quarter this expense growth was driven by our acquisition of dividend finance during the year combined with continued investments in provide compensation associated with our minimum wage hike as well as higher technology and communications expense reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives excluding the impacts of dividend and provide total expenses would have been down yearoveryear moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases increased sequentially average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter reflecting an increase in ci balances growth was led by our corporate bank and robust in almost all of our industry verticals among our verticals production was strongest in energy including renewables which increased over yearoveryear health care growth was led by provide with provide balances up yearoveryear the periodend commercial revolver utilization rate remained stable compared to last quarter at average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter led by dividend finance as well as growth in home equity this was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans average total deposits increased compared to the prior quarter as an increase in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits periodend deposits increased compared to the prior quarter after the deliberate runoff of surge deposits in the middle of the year we have achieved solid deposit outcomes throughout the second half of reflecting our strong core deposit franchise moving to credit as tim mentioned credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained wellbelow normalized levels the npa ratio of basis points was down basis points sequentially and our commercial npa ratio has now declined for nine consecutive quarters the net chargeoff ratio increased just basis point sequentially to basis points within our guidance range the ratio of earlystage loan delinquencies to days past due also increased only basis points sequentially and remains below levels from a balance sheet management perspective we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on highquality relationships in consumer we have focused on lending to homeowners which are of our consumer portfolio we also have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers in commercial we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in cre across all commercial portfolios we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office cre we have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong stable nii through the cycle our strong deposit franchise our investment portfolio positioning and our cash flow hedge portfolios will provide protection against lower rates wellbeyond just the next few years as well as the addition of the fixed rate lending capabilities from both dividend and provide should continue to support our strong throughthecycle outcomes fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 moving to the acl our acl build this quarter was million primarily reflecting loan growth dividend finance loans contributed million to the acl build as you know we incorporate moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance the base economic scenario from moodys assumes the unemployment rate reaches while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of given our expected periodend loan growth including continued strong production from dividend finance we currently expect a first quarter build to the acl of approximately million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios moving to capital our cet1 grew from to during the quarter the increase in capital reflects our strong earnings generation which was partially offset by the impact of a million share repurchase completed in december moving to our current outlook we expect full year average total loan growth between and compared to we expect most of the growth to come from the commercial loan portfolio which is expected to increase in the mid single digits in we expect line utilization to be stable in the first half of but then decline slightly to as capital markets conditions improve a bit in the second half of the year we expect total consumer loans to increase modestly as an expected increase from dividend finance and modest growth from home equity and card will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage reflecting the environment for the first quarter of we expect average total loan balances to be stable sequentially we expect commercial loans to increase reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain generally stable we expect consumer balances to be stable to down reflecting lower auto and residential mortgage balances partially offset by dividend loan originations of billion or so in the first quarter from a funding perspective we expect average core deposits to be stable to down sequentially reflecting seasonal factors before resuming modest growth in the subsequent quarters of we expect continued migration from dda into interestbearing products throughout with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits ending the year in the low shifting to the income statement given our loan outlook and the benefits of our balance sheet management we expect full year nii to increase to our forecast assumes our securities portfolio remains relatively stable from the second half of levels and reflects the forward curve as of early january with fed funds increasing to in the first quarter and the first 25basispoint rate cut occurring in the fourth quarter of our current outlook assumes total interestbearing deposit costs which were basis points in the fourth quarter of to increase in the first half of before settling in around or so in the second half of our outlook contemplates an environment of continued deposit competition which would result in a cumulative deposit beta by the end of of around given the two additional rate hikes in our forecast over our october guidance the future impacts of deposit repricing lags combined with the dynamics of our loan portfolio should result in our full year net interest margin increasing basis points or so relative to the fourth quarter of nim we expect nii in the first quarter to be down to sequentially reflecting the impact of a lower day count in the quarter combined with stable loan balances fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 we expect adjusted noninterest income to be relatively stable in reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue capital markets fees wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be offset by the market headwinds impacting top line mortgage revenue and higher earnings credit rates on treasury management as well as subdued leasing remarketing revenue if capital markets conditions do not improve we would expect to generate improved nii and lowered expenses in the second half of we expect our fourth quarter tra revenue to decline from million in to million in our guidance also assumes a minimal amount of private equity income in compared to around million in the prior year we expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down to compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the tra largely reflecting seasonal factors additionally we expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue which we expect will be offset by a slowdown in ma advisory revenue and the impact of higher earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue given the rate environment we expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up to compared to our expense outlook includes a 1point headwind each from the fdic insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on january the marktomarket impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in expenses and the full year expense impact of dividend finance we also continue to invest in our digital transformation which should result in technology expense growth of around consistent with the past several years we also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid single digits area our outlook assumes we close branches in the first half of that will deliver inyear expense savings and also add to new branches in our highgrowth markets which will result in high single digits growth of our southeast branch network we expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to the fourth quarter as is always the case for us our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal expenses associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes excluding these seasonal items expenses would be down approximately in the first quarter in total our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of to resulting in ppnr growth in the to range this would result in a sub53 efficiency ratio for the full year a 3point improvement from we expect net chargeoffs to be in the to 35basispoint range with first quarter net chargeoffs in the to 30basispoint range in summary with our strong ppnr growth engine disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to generate long term sustainable value for customers communities employees and shareholders with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 thanks jamie before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call up for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys how are you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you share with us tim when you talk to your business customers it seems like theres a real disconnect between everybodys outlook for loan loss reserve building we understand of course that cecl and youre going to be proactive life of loan losses and you and your peers are building up the reserves but then you look at the spreads in the highyield market theyre coming in one of your competitors yesterday pointed out that the commercial loan spreads havent widened out where is the disconnect or are we just going to fall off a cliff possibly in the second half of the year but can you share with us what are your commercial customers seeing in their daytoday business and are they seeing the weakness that everybody is projecting that will happen later this year timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah sure gerard and thanks for the question i dont think were going to fall off a cliff in the second half of the year thats certainly not consistent with what i hear i was out and when we looked at the calendar the other day i think get into of our markets in the fourth quarter this past year i think i probably saw or clients while i was out there i mean heres what i hear like if you look at the manufacturing clients as an example theyre all feeling much more optimistic about moderation as it relates to raw materials and i think by and large they solved the supply chain issues that they were facing either through inventory builds or through restructuring the supply chain or because the overseas suppliers that they were relying on have come back online or there isnt an issue in the ports or otherwise i think the issues theyre running into are twofold one labor continues to be a challenge and its labor cost but its also just labor availability two because they solved their supply chain challenges through building inventory fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 when you think about lower inventory turns you add in rising interest rates now debt service costs to revenue are a higher proportion and so while they got the costs associated with raw materials through this last year in price increases theyre all looking to the next to months to try to figure out how they pass on then just the sort of continued slow grind on labor and debt service costs the services clients are having no problem pushing through costs which i think is like evident in the inflation data and personally to anybody that took a vacation over the holidays this year and they continue to be optimistic because demand has remained strong i think what i hear more than anything else is that were going to have a little bit of a slow grind down here in terms of growth and that if anything the thing im more worried about is not do we end up with plus gdp or minus gdp but rather that the market may be overly optimistic about how quickly the fed is going to be able to bring rates down and that the byproduct of that is from an operating standpoint you have to be thinking a lot more about how you position the balance sheet for the next three to five years and for more tepid growth and higher rates than worrying about the next call it months in terms of the outlook gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good very helpful jamie sort of coming back to you on one of your favorite topics aoci can you share with us two things one what does the accretion look like coming into for the aoci number and second in your securities portfolio i think you showed in your release that the taxable securities are yielding today what are you guys seeing in new yields as you put money to work james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah thanks gerard and i knew when we put you in the queue i was going to get an aoci question so thanks for living up to that in terms of the aoci if you look at yearend levels with the 10year at roughly the aoci earns back with our duration at it earns back pretty evenly across that time period so billion or so of tce earnback per year obviously no capital impact given that were category iv if you fast forward to today and where the 10year is certainly weve had a significant improvement in the aoci just in the first days of january so that would be helpful to the tce as well in terms of the securities yields obviously were very pleased with how the portfolio is positioned at a yield i would expect that whats going to happen with the investment portfolio is that it will continue to grind higher each quarter and finish the year at a level so the average for the year is probably in the range because as were reinvesting cash flows or seeing opportunities on new investments were looking at entry points in that area right now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well hi fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i know you guys i think it was your phrase that heldtomaturity securities were like being in the roach motel if i got that right and you have what its like hardly any securities in held to maturity which gives you flexibility and im not sure how much that matters and maybe just gives you more flexibility as you look ahead but youre also one of the few banks that are if you take the midpoint of your guidance youre guiding for higher nii off fourth quarter levels and im is there a connection between how youre managing your securities book and that guidance or are they separate but really the question is nii guide as it relates to your securities james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah mike its jamie yes i did reference the roach motel a few quarters back and i guess todays theme is the held to maturity is more like a hide to maturity and it certainly helps having that flexibility to reposition as environments change but really theres no one thing thats driving the strong nii outlook and nim expansion for us it really is the result of years of hard work of deliberately positioning the balance sheet for really what is a range of outcomes that still could play out given all of the uncertainty and it really is a total company effort and that comes from the household growth new commercial relationships product innovation the fintech acquisitions and ultimately sales execution both on loan pricing and deposit generation so thats really what is giving us the ability to grow nii during the course of as well as expanding nim at the same time and i think its one of those capabilities of fifth third that weve proven over the past decade thats perhaps underappreciated by the market and like you said the securities are certainly going to be a higher level of gross income over the course of in part because we were patient in deploying the excess cash that we had and not buying securities when the 10year was below or even below like some of the other banks i think one of the bigger differentiators for us will be the fixed rate loan businesses that we have and our ability to emphasize or deemphasize those businesses and right now we have a little bit of an emphasis on auto being able to generate roughly billion this year and then dividend where the gross income on dividend will exceed over million of growth in relative to and so really when you package it all together with an investment portfolio thats in a net discount position of about billion a dividend portfolio that by the end of will have unamortized fees that will roll through nii of about billion weve got a lot of downside protection and a core franchise that with its ability to grow loans and deposits really is helpful and within all of this guide we do not assume spread widening so to the extent that were to happen as tim mentioned that would only be upside to our guide mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then tim just a broader level i mean do you see a recession based on your bottomup analysis based on all the markets youre visiting based on the clients youre talking to i mean i we hear so much recession talk fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 and then we hear about your loan growth and everything else what do you just think from a highlevel standpoint and then what are your assumptions for reserves in terms of unemployment timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah ill let jamie field the question on the specific assumptions on reserves mike but i probably lost my crystal ball when i moved offices earlier this past year so i have to rely on what i hear from clients or what we get from our friends at moodys and otherwise if you ask me today i would tell you were going to have a shallow recession but i dont know that there is a big difference between of growth and of gdp decline in particular given the amount of derisking thats been done inside the banking sector and certainly inside fifth third over the course of the past decade i think the more interesting dynamic really is going to be this question about the duration of a recession if we see it and what happens if we dont get a typical recovery right if you have several years of below trend growth and inflation that sits above the historic certainly above the historic target but jamie you want to field the question on the inputs on the reserves james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah mike as you know we used the moodys scenarios of their baseline scenario and that drives weighting and we maintained our weightings at with the upside and the adverse scenario or probability scenario so in the adverse the unemployment gets almost up to and the baseline unemployment ratchets up to and then we blend those scenarios together to drive the acl so i think it meshes well with what tims comments were of a shallow or mild downturn in the economy and then a recovery mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so thats for the unemployment and for the unemployment james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp on the upside which is the upside scenario is that the fed delivers a soft landing so unemployment stays in the high so in the high the baseline at peak and then a downside at at a unemployment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thank you for taking the question jamie i guess it doesnt based on what you said it doesnt feel like you would get there anytime soon but in the past you talked about sort of the margin floor in the event of low rates just curious given all the sort of the ebbs and flows we had in expectations and just the own pardon me the moves youve made with your own balance sheet how are you thinking about that lower bound kind of as we go forward in that level james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah we feel very good about the ability to have a floor on the nim at that level and a down basis points scenario should that play out given all the work weve done on the investment portfolio with the bullet lockedout cash flows along with being in a fairly sizable net discount position and the duration that we have combined with the fixed rate loan origination platforms with auto dividend and provide those should all provide yields and then as weve talked in the past weve layered in billion of receivefixed swaps that will also provide additional protection from through and that may be one other differentiator for us relative to peers is that weve been focused more on protecting that downside over a longer period of time and therefore the duration of our swap book as well as our investment portfolio maybe a little better positioned should that downturn occur at the end of the decade r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then switching gears just a bit maybe some thoughts on kind of the trajectory of fees as we go through the year you guys always have the seasonality that helps fourth quarter hurts the first but it will be i think a pretty substantial rampup starting in the just curious i think you alluded to capital markets kind of normalizing or recovering in the second half of the year just maybe your thoughts on main drivers as the year plays out james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp sure thanks when it comes to the fee income we did say relatively stable over the course of the year and it probably is helpful to look at it from two components the first would be a category ill call the factors in our control that do deliver nice growth both from a strong customer acquisition perspective as well as overall fee generation from a combination of the branch network our wealth business the commercial business that will drive both credit card income as well as wealth and asset management fees in the mid singledigit area and top line fee equivalent growth in the treasury management area in the high singledigit area given our strong product lineup from there transitioning to mortgage thats actually going to be the largest growth item for us in and it really goes back to all the work that we put into growing the servicing business in and when levels were more depressed it was a good buying opportunity and so given our strong mortgage servicing platform fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 well increase those fees from million in to the million area so thats a growth of almost whereas top line mortgage should be relatively stable off very lowlevels so we feel good about those items capital markets are certainly the wildcard in our guide given that we do expect mid to high single digits growth in the first half of the year relative to the first half of and then we assume a little bit of additional growth in the back half of the year under the assumption that the capital markets disruption should abate once the fed reaches its terminal fed funds level and again as i said in the prepared remarks if that were to not happen then we would expect a little bit better loan growth little bit better nii and lower expenses so in terms of ppnr on a relative basis i feel confident in that should the capital markets improvement not occur and then the other category when it comes to fees it would be the headwinds facing us so theyre really environmental given the increase in interest rates and thats on the earnings credit were managing earnings credits to about a beta which is a little bit better than what we thought as we entered the cycle but even with that service charges ultimately will be down midsingle digits for the year which more than offset that strong top line fee equivalent growth on the consumer overdraft and nsf side we probably do a little bit better relative to peers just given that we moved sooner on some of those fee and structural changes but overall the first half of the year will be a little bit softer as we lap those changes that occurred midyear and then as we said in the prepared remarks the tra will decline in as will our expectations on lower private equity income so that other fees will be down or so timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp i think if theres one thing i might add there its while we expect capital markets to improve this year i would not say we expect them to normalize or recover with the investments that have been made in that business a full recovery in capital markets would result in a substantially larger business and revenue footprint than were anticipating this year we just dont expect it to be as bad or as locked up as we saw in r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co excellent all right thats terrific color thank you guys very much operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp morning fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was wondering can you just walk through the puts and takes around deposit growth in i mean it seems like the expansion in the southeast is definitely a tailwind here so how are you thinking about deposit growth especially given the more challenging macro backdrop bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah this is bryan certainly we feel good about our franchise and the improvements that weve made over the years we have a very strong new customer origination engine both across consumer and commercial weve got strong new consumer household growth strong nqrs from a commercial perspective we have a very high performing treasury management business that provides a lot of deposit support as well as growth and as you mentioned our southeast branch expansion obviously is going to create a tailwind for us as well and finally we have proven and analytically driven customer offers that have done a really nice job through the cycle and driving new balances when we need them so we continue to maintain a lot of confidence in the environment that were going to be able to deliver and gain our fair share of deposits as the environment changes obviously we cant grow in all environments but we are cautiously optimistic and wellpositioned timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah and just to put a number narrowly on the southeast like we grew consumer deposits by over in the southeast this past year to bryans point that is and to yours manan that has been a tailwind for us manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it helpful and then maybe the flip side of that is the wholesale funding we saw you had some wholesale funding earlier in the year so are those balances where youd like them to be for now and how does that fit into the overall funding strategy bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah were very comfortable with where we are from a wholesale funding perspective we continue to have very significant contingent liquidity sources that help us manage through uncertainty in the environment if we see decent deposit growth we could see those wholesale funding balances come down over time but we have a lot of flexibility across our funding base to help us manage through both liquidity needs as well as net interest income manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so much operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i just had one followup question on the credit comments earlier tim you mentioned about the resiliency of the bank but when we think about your scenario of higher for longer rates do you think that begins to weigh on your customers when you look at either on ci or on the cre book that the longer the fed rate has to stay at the 5plus rate their cost of equity capital is going higher demand is falling off and does that lead to a lot more pain on credit maybe not even later in the year into absent fed rate cuts timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah let me give you the quick answer and then ill let richard comment absolutely i think that is our view is that its more of a slowgrowing dynamic here than a cliff right as gerard mentioned earlier and that the longer that we go with rates at elevated levels the more pressure that it places on business commercial borrowers in particular i think our consumer borrower is a little bit different because such a significant share of our consumer lending is done to homeowners that theyve had the ability to inoculate themselves a little bit from inflation because they locked in these historically low fixed rate costs of housing richard do you want to talk a little bit about where specifically you think that grind may take a toll richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah ebrahim i think theres a couple of things here to your question specifically clearly higher interest rates for longer is going to put pressure across the board and i think thats frankly by design from a fed standpoint to get things to slow down the biggest impact is going to be in the leverage lending portfolio were starting with higher levels of leverage clearly higher interest rates impact free cash flow one of the things that we do is when we do our underwriting and frankly our quarterly monitoring is we will go back and look at the rate curve and in fact we look at and we underwrite the rate curve forward curve plus basis points to make sure that theres enough cushion in free cash flow so that while were underwriting and taking on these loans we believe these borrowers can withstand the pressure of higher rates through their margins and free cash flow i think the other thing were watching for as we think about the economy and tim referenced labor both cost and availability that in certain segments continues to put pressure on margins particularly for those industries that have a mismatch between the revenue management and their expense management so maybe theyve got longterm fixed price sales contracts theyve got to manage through with shortterm labor and probably the most acute example of where this is happening is in pockets of health care senior living weve talked about notfor profit hospitals which have low margins the cost to deliver care and service has gone up pretty dramatically you can look at nursing availability and wages as a really good example and theres a lag there in the revenue cycle in terms of reimbursement rates whether its public or private where these companies for these companies to maintain margins profitability and so in those cases were looking at other things the quality of the balance sheet liquidity and liquidity burn rates but no question that as rates are higher for longer it puts pressure on businesses fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 i think the last thing and this is part of client selection is understanding the ability of our borrowers to adapt and the resilience to these things so its not just a situation where rates are higher and companies dont adapt or consumers dont adapt and its part of the relationship model and part of the way we go to market in terms of the advice and counsel with our customers understanding whats happening looking for alternatives finding new ways to finance these customers so that resilience through the cycle will continue to endure ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that was helpful and i guess just one quick followup jamie on dividend finance about million of provisioning anything else around dividend finance in terms of growth outlook this year versus last year that we should be aware of are things picking up or slowing down as we think about just the underlying growth in the business james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah we feel very good about the business that dividend is doing especially on the solar side of the aisle and for us were expecting roughly billion of originations in with a weighting of solar home improvement home improvement were less enamored with but again its a good product offering for other points in the cycle so its being deemphasized and solar continues to do incredibly well and if anything theres perhaps a little bit of upside to our nii guide on dividend for just given the strength of the business as well as the pricing power ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the credit front i know you gave us really good detail on delinquencies and nonaccruals do you have what criticized assets did in the quarter and what areas of criticized may have migrated negatively richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah this is richard thanks for the question criticized assets were flat for the quarter both nominally i think we had a little bit of loan growth so about basis points of commercial crit improvement across the board i fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 would also point out that in addition to crit being stable delinquencies to and above npas charge offs were all down for the quarter on the commercial side i think the things were watching and i hit on it a little bit health care specifically notforprofit hospitals and senior living for the reasons we just talked about weve seen some pressure there because of the mismatch between the revenue management and the expense management a little bit of pressure in or watching in commercial specialty products consumer specialty products right thats a function of consumers shifting from durables and discretionaries to consumables and nondiscretionary and supply chain and inventory management issues thats the trading down issue and thats where weve seen most of the movement the leverage portfolio from an asset quality standpoint has been stable and operating within our expectations john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you thats helpful and then sticking to credit just my followup is around both commercial real estate and home equity in commercial real estate it looks like you did see pretty noteworthy moveup in delinquencies as well as the nonaccruals and so can you guys talk a little bit about property types within commercial real estate where youre seeing a little bit of stress and where your loantovalue ratios are and then in home equity it looks like you also saw a pretty noteworthy increase in delinquencies there just want to get color around that portfolio thanks richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp let me take commercial real estate i think when you think about the delinquencies if you look at the delinquencies and this is on the slide deck on slide 90plus is still zero weve got none movements in to basis points its off a really really low base so its not something that were concerned about from a commercial real estate perspective i think the thing were watching for were watching and i know a lot of people got questions on office were watching office thats a small number for us in fact our performance in office is actually in line with or better than the rest of the commercial bank but there is some pressure there as occupancy attendance and lease rates continue to and sublease rates continue to fall i think theres a couple of things weve got a very small amount of urban central business district office thats where most of the pressure is in terms of subletting rates that for us is class a property i would also tell you that in addition to class vintage matters thats all new product its a new product its esg qualified leed gold and platinum it has all the modern amenities so we feel really good about those particular properties the rest of our office portfolio sits more in suburban markets and again you just dont have the same pressure from a lease rate sublease rate and a tenants perspective across the board across the rest of commercial real estate multifamily continues to perform very well the demographic trends the household formation continue to be strong rental rates continue to accelerate faster than construction costs so again theres a positive tailwind there same thing with industrial demand this kind of goes back to the reshoring thing trend industrial demand is really strong continues lease rates continue to hold in so we feel really good there hospitality is stable and that fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 continues to be a good trend and then in retail is stable so feeling really good about where we are from an overall perspective in commercial real estate you want to add a comment there tim timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp and john i just was going to say on the equity side all youre seeing i think in the consumer for us at the moment is just seasonality like sequential comps from the third quarter to the fourth quarter are the wrong comparisons just given the natural seasonality in those businesses i think its better just to look at yearover year and we expect consumer credit to normalize over time thats reflected in the guide that we gave but the delinquency dynamics there are really no different than what you would have seen prepandemic other than the fact that theyre still muted relative to what we would have had in the past so i personally home equity is not the area thats been an area of focus for me thats for certain john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yeah yeah no i got that i just saw the reserve addition as well to the home equity allowance timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp but actually i think the dynamic there is that for the first time in as long as ive been at the bank we actually had quarteroverquarter home equity growth so thats whats driving that outcome but not a change in perspective for us on the quality of the credit or the likely outcomes there john pancari q analyst evercore group llc all right good problem to have okay all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i might have misheard the comment on the indirect auto kind of loan growth expectations for this year can you just repeat that what the strategy is and what youre seeing in the spreads there james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah actually spreads have done well and are actually off to a very solid start in we finished the year in with billion of production if you take auto as well as the rv marine and specialty business combined so that fixed rate consumer secured loan category our expectation for for that asset class is to be down to about billion or so so loan balances in that caption we would expect to be down however yields we expect to improve about basis points from the fourth quarter levels to fourth quarter levels so it is a nice accelerator to the earlier question around how are you able to deliver both nii growth and nim expansion that certainly is a helpful driver fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it and then just separately on the capital level were seeing some divergence in targeted capital out there obviously theres like upward pressure at the biggest banks not really relevant to you but then some of your peers are targeting closer to and im certainly on board with seeming very high but im wondering is there any kind of behindthescenes pressure whether its rating agencies or regulators to just hold a little bit more given some of the macro uncertainty or anything else that were not seeing james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah great question matt thanks for asking i would say that as this environment unfolds it really is to your point going to create differentiation in both performance execution and overall balance sheet positioning weve i think for a number of quarters and years now been discussing how cautious our outlook is and that has really informed what were willing to do from a credit risk appetite perspective so the capital levels ultimately are a factor of the credit profile of whats on the sheet as well as the reserve levels that we have so the cet1 level at and an acl level of creates a very sufficient loss absorption capacity and given our scb level is at the minimum i think external factors or forces would say that were very wellpositioned from a credit profile perspective as well as from a loss absorption capacity so we feel good about that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open benjamin raisbeck q analyst jefferies llc hey guys this is ben raisbeck on for ken just a quick followup on the dividend finance as those originations continue to ramp up and mortgage loans go on balance sheet when do you ultimately see that nii benefit overcoming those reserve builds and becoming accretive to earnings and then can you just remind us of what type of loss rates youre assuming on those dividend loans thanks james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes great question the ppnr levels for dividend will be positive in the back half of or in the net income of dividend postacl will be positive or accretive in certainly if prepayments accelerate faster than what we have modeled then that large amount of unamortized platform fees will come through the pl would it improve or accelerate the return profile but for now thats how we have it playing out and we model roughly an eightyear life on the dividend asset and that we would expect to have loss rates in the 125basispoint area on a blended basis for the portfolio per year over those eight years benjamin raisbeck q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for taking my question fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4
