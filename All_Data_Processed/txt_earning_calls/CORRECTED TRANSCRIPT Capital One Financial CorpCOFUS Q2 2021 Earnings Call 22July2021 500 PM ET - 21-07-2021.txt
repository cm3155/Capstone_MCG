andrew m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the second quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share included in the results for the quarter was a million legal reserve build net of this adjusting item earnings per share in the quarter was on a gaap basis preprovision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to billion we recorded a provision benefit of billion in the quarter as million of chargeoff was offset by a billion allowance release revenue grew in the linked quarter largely driven by the impact of strong domestic card purchase volume on noninterest income and the absence of the mark on our snowflake investment a quarter ago periodend loans held for investment grew billion or inclusive of the effect of moving billion of loans to held for sale during the quarter the loans moved to held for sale consisted of billion of an international card partnership portfolio and billion in commercial loans turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter we released billion of allowance primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook turning to slide we provide the allowance coverage ratios by segment you can see allowance coverage declined in the quarter across all segments largely reflecting the dynamics i just described however coverage ratios remain well above prepandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to absorb a wide range of outcomes our domestic card coverage is now down from last quarter our branded card coverage is recall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is largely driven by the losssharing agreements in some of our partnership portfolios coverage in our consumer business declined about basis points to in addition to continued strong credit performance and improved economic outlook historically high auto values aided the reduction in coverage coverage in our commercial banking business declined about basis points to with the single largest driver being the improvement in our energy portfolio capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the quarter was the lcr continues to be well above the regulatory requirement our liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately billion the billion decline in total liquidity was driven by lower ending cash balances our cash position declined in the quarter as it was redeployed to net loan growth wholesale funding maturities a modest increase in our securities portfolio and share repurchases moving to page ill now discuss net interest margin you can see that our second quarter net interest margin was basis points lower than the prior quarter the linked quarter decline in nim was largely driven by lower yield in our card portfolio where the typical seasonal decrease in revolve rate was exacerbated by higher transactor volume and associated higher payments these impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact from one more day in the quarter lastly turning to slide i will cover our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the second quarter down basis points from the first quarter loan growth and capital actions were largely offset by earnings growth during the quarter the federal reserve released the results of their stress test our stress capital buffer requirement which will be effective on october of this year is resulting in a total capital requirement by the fed of while we saw a decline in this years scb its important to note that the feds stress testing results can move around meaningfully from year to year and are only one of many factors that we use in our capital planning process based on our internal modeling we continue to estimate that our cet1 capital need is around turning to share repurchases we repurchased billion of common stock in the second quarter the full amount allowed under the feds capital preservation measures we have approximately billion remaining of our current board authorization of billion now let me move on to dividends in the third quarter of we reduced our dividend to due to the feds capital preservation measures we chose to continue this reduced level of dividend in the fourth quarter of out of an abundance of caution the difference between our historical dividend and the reduced level for those two quarters was per common share therefore we expect to make up for the reduced level of dividends from the second half of by paying a special dividend in the third quarter of in addition to the special dividend we expect to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from per share to per share in the third quarter both the special dividend and the increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to will be subject to board approval with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone ill begin on slide with our credit card business strong year overyear purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of more than offsetting a modest yearoveryear decline in loan balances and provision for credit losses improved significantly capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide second quarter results reflect building momentum in our domestic card business as we emerge from the pandemic consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates resulting in strong revenue growth and a more modest yearoveryear decline in loan balances high payment rates are continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results domestic card purchase volume for the second quarter was up from the second quarter of purchase volume was up from the second quarter of which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw growth of versus te spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter in june te purchase volume was up compared to june of at the end of the quarter domestic card loan balances were down billion or about yearoveryear excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held for sale last year second quarter ending loans declined about yearoveryear compared to the sequential quarter ending loans were up about ahead of typical seasonal growth of credit performance remained strikingly strong the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points better than the prior year provision for credit losses improved by about billion yearoveryear we swung from a large allowance build in the second quarter last year to a large allowance release this year let me turn to domestic card revenue margin purchase volume growth outpacing loan growth and strong credit were the key drivers of domestic card revenue margin which was up basis points yearoveryear to revenue margin increased over basis points quarteroverquarter higher than our typical seasonal pattern total company marketing expense was million in the quarter up million compared to the second quarter of our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends as we emerge from the pandemic were seeing strong originations and purchase volumes our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation we are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and continue to build our franchise at the same time were keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment which is intensifying pulling up our domestic card business continues to deliver significant value and build momentum slide summarizes second quarter results for our consumer banking business auto growth and exceptional auto credit are the main themes in second quarter consumer banking results driven by auto second quarter ending loans increased yearoveryear in the consumer banking business average loans also grew auto originations were up yearoveryear and up from the linked quarter pentup demand and high auto prices drove a second quarter surge in growth across the auto marketplace in the context of increased industry growth our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive strong growth in our auto business second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear average deposits were up yearoveryear consumer banking revenue increased from the prior year quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits second quarter provision for credit losses improved by billion yearoveryear driven by an allowance release and lower chargeoffs in our auto business credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong yearoveryear the second quarter chargeoff rate improved basis points to negative and the delinquency rate was essentially flat at in the quarter elevated used car prices drove an increase in auction proceeds amplifying the normal seasonal benefit we see from tax refunds around this time of the year as used vehicle prices normalize they will become a headwind to the auto chargeoff rate we expect the auto chargeoff rate to increase from the unusually low second quarter level moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business second quarter ending loan balances were down yearoveryear average loans were down commercial line utilization continues to be down year overyear and we moved billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale quarterly average deposits increased from the second quarter of and from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity second quarter revenue was up from the prior year quarter and down from the linked quarter the linked quarter decline is more than entirely driven by a onetime cost associated with moving the commercial real estate loans to held for sale this decline was offset by an equivalent onetime gain in the other category and is therefore neutral to the company excluding this effect commercial banking revenue would have increased about yearoveryear and from the linked quarter provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the second quarter of driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and a swing from net chargeoffs to net recoveries in the second quarter the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate was negative basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was our commercial banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning several key themes are evident in our second quarter results credit remains strikingly strong purchase volume and loans are rebounding were continuing to invest to propel our future results and were returning capital to our shareholders we are seeing increasing nearterm opportunities to build our domestic card business as we emerge from the pandemic we are leaning further into marketing to seize these opportunities we are also increasing our marketing for auto national banking and our brand we are now in the ninth year of a journey to build a modern technology company from the bottom of the tech stack up our progress is accelerating and the stakes are rising competitor tech investments are increasing as technology is increasingly seen as an existential issue the investment flowing into fintechs is nothing short of breathtaking and the war for tech talent continues to escalate including levels of compensation we continue to invest in technology and the opportunities that emerge as our transformation gains traction our modern technology is powering our current performance and setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thanks rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call holly please start the qa question and answer section operator absolutely thank you so much operator instructions our first question today will come from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good evening want to see if i could get your thoughts on payment rates did you see a peak in the quarter and if not if you can talk about the timing of inflection and then separately how does that impact your growth assumption for card receivables and the timing on that front thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp john in our card business payment rates remain at historically high levels and as you know government stimulus has been amplifying payment rates and while these programs have been winding down customer balance sheets are extremely healthy and payment rates remain elevated you can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics and while not a perfect reflection of our total portfolio q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels and these high payment rates are muting balanced growth even as spend is very strong and of course the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit performance which drives strong profitability and capital generation so we actually are always happy when our customers are paying at high levels and its indicative of a healthy consumer and those high payment rates correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see if we look at the monthly numbers we can see john a little bit of easing of the payment rates i dont know if that would be a trend to indicate it certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend more and more and theyre going out and returning hopefully back to normal it would be a natural thing that payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move toward normalizing a little bit so i guess john i would say weve seen the earliest of indications of that but its still running at really quite a breathtaking level jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator of course our next question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich putting together the comments you made about the significant amount of excess capital and then the comment in the release about seeing increasing nearterm opportunities to build your franchise could you talk a little bit about whether youre looking at primarily kind of organic opportunities or inorganic ones as well richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp moshe as you know well because youve been there from the beginning in following us and having great insights we really built our company as sort of wired for organic growth we installed in the founding days what i call horizontal accounting where we track every action and cohort and everything on a lifetime economic basis and we measure it before and during and afterward to see how its going and so we always put organic at the top of the list and heres a great example i mean while every bank thats every national bank thats been created has come through many many acquisitions weve had some acquisitions in our journey but we are really leaning into a organically driven national growth strategy in banking and as i said a few minutes ago we see good organic growth opportunities which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now and very much these opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that weve built and some of the innovation that were rolling out with respect to acquisitions were not putting any energy or a strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions what we are looking at is technology acquisitions and really in fact there is a spectrum on the technology side with respect to fintechs and tech companies on the continuum at one end is just being a partner with them and then the next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them and you saw that with snowflake for example and then there are sometimes acquisitions all of those have weve been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years and im struck by the traction and success that were having when we look back at some of the acquisitions of little fintechs for example and tech companies we are very very pleased with the performance and in many ways these things are generally outperforming one of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech stack so do the fintechs or tech companies that were buying and so the integration and the compatibility the ability to attract and then really retain the talent past sort of the contractual period is something that i think leans in our favor so lots of positives there there is one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side and thats the valuations so weve recently gone to a few of these conversations and said love the company but not at that price so we are very aware about where pricing is but strategically i think if you kind of open the aperture and dont talk about necessarily this very moment i think for capital one its an organicfirst strategy but acquisitions of fintechs and tech companies at the right price and theyll usually be the little ones i think will help fill out our business and accelerate our opportunities jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 operator absolutely next well hear from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you considering the tightening underwriting that we saw during do you expect normalized credit to maybe run below prepandemic levels as we go into and potentially into richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp kevin jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp hearing that richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah but i think we it was a little echoey but i felt i heard what you were saying there kevin from where we are right now which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times its got a ways to go to normalize we are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is not because we want to be coy about it but because in fact i think its a hard thing to predict these days what we like to talk about is the drivers so talking about the drivers the consumer is in a very strong place right now and i think whats striking is and i mentioned this earlier when you look at what the average consumer and this is average because the experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what im describing on average but the accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the government stimulus monthly benefits ease i think there is a bit of an accumulated balance there that will be beneficial for the credit performance of consumers so theres really only one way for the credit to go from here and that is in normalizing i think it starts with a bit of a head start and i think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers choices on payment rates and as ive mentioned earlier i think its a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and for credit to gradually normalize the directions are inevitable the timing is speculative our view is during this period of time lets take advantage of the market opportunity that is here the place the consumer is but lets also be cognizant of how markets work how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the natural indicators of overheating jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you next well hear from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 hey everybody thanks for taking my question this afternoon look were and this topic has come up a couple of times were looking at the reserve rates and thinking about them in the context of day one reserve levels im curious how you now reflect on day one allowance coverage and what that could look like on a longterm basis as we return to normal im curious in particular if you think some of the policy initiatives weve seen during the crisis change your longterm outlook in terms of potential loss rates andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks rick this is andrew ill take that and i think as we look at the allowance every quarter were going to take into account a large number of variables and assumptions which would certainly take policy and other factors and so as i reflect back on the ratio that we had upon adoption a lot of things have changed since then and so within every single asset class the mix is going to impact our coverage needs and then you look at overall the balance sheet mix across each of those asset classes will impact things so i look at all of those factors and i dont think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination but i also think that if you put into the formula like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix i still believe that the prepandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look like but again itll take into account each successive quarter all of the things that were looking at in terms of the mix and broad economic assumptions including policy as you mentioned jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you next well hear from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just a question here on how youre thinking about the opportunity to invest for that account growth you indicated that account growth is up maybe give us a sense as to how much more its up than usual i know usually you dont give numbers for that but it would be helpful to understand the benefit that those marketing dollars is generating today and then how much more you think the opportunity set is here to ramp up the marketing in the back half of the year given the opportunity set that you have in front of you thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp betsy yeah we dont tend to give out the specific account growth numbers the origination numbers but they are strong right now theyre not the strongest that we have ever seen were pleased that theyre really quite strong capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 because obviously there was some weakness a year ago in those kind of numbers so we have seen very solid performance we feel really good about the account originations so we are leaning further into marketing to drive future growth and also to just continue to build the underlying franchise and as weve said these opportunities are partly because of what the market has to give right now and partly opportunities that are enhanced by our technology transformation and the marketing of course is especially going into the card side of the business but also just look on tv youve seen us steadily investing in national banking were very happy with how thats going and you may have seen for the first time this quarter that we have now gone on national tv in the auto side so these are advertising that is debuting some of the technology innovations that we have at capital one some of the exceptional customer experiences that weve built and were seeing good traction in the origination side of the business and so we continue to lean into marketing jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you next well hear from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey rich i was wondering if you could talk a bit about the tech spend outlook i saw a report that capital one was hiring a large amount of software programmers to take advantage of the public cloud move and then you mentioned fintech i was just curious if you thought that the regulatory landscape would ever balance out or if thats sort of something thats not going to happen richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay yes don thank you so let me talk about tech and the tech hiring winning in technology really kind of begins and ends with one thing hiring worldclass tech talent and it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly the hardest thing to pull off in business today because while this talent principle is true in any business it is profoundly true in technology as the demand for worldclass tech talent vastly exceeds the supply so weve built a tech brand and have had great success in attracting top talent and were competing headtohead with the leading technology companies in the us and weve been leaning into tech hiring for years and this is a strong year of hiring most of the new roles were hiring for are engineering roles in software development cloud infrastructure and machine learning and these are the most sought after roles in the world and were getting real traction here but essentially if you pull way up and its more than just words when we say it weve really been living this which is to from the ground up build a technology company that does banking essentially what capital one is the technology and data are increasingly what the business is and at the heart of that journey is the tech talent i also mentioned one other thing don is that the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward right in front of our eyes and i wanted to flag that to investors that is just something that again its the natural consequence of the demand greatly exceeding the supply so i think its going to be hard for most companies for all companies to do hiring and get the numbers that they want we are leaning into that i think were in a very good position but were going to need to pay appropriately for that talent capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 don you asked about fintechs and what we feel about fintechs and possibly a comment on the regulatory side i just have a tremendous interest in fintechs and maybe thats because capital one was an original fintech before there was such a word and i look at the fintech marketplace and i think some of these fintechs are bringing great innovations to the market and we very carefully study these innovations and i think that we look at these both as threats to our business we look at them as opportunities maybe we can partner with the fintechs in some cases there are acquisitions associated with that and in some cases what theyre doing are beacons of opportunity that we can pursue the fintechs today i think what banks have to stare at is that fintechs today are benefiting from their modern cloudbased technologies and their innovative and entrepreneurial approach to disrupting markets the tremendous amount of funding that is out there i mean for example these days the venture capital funding going into fintechs is close to i think i dont have this data right in front of me but its close to double the next category in terms of the amount of venture funding going into this so this is pretty electrifying and the fintechs benefit from a lower level of regulation than financial institutions have now i dont think right now the success of fintechs that one can look at fintechs and say the primary reason theyre succeeding in areas sometimes more than the banks are is because they are less regulated i think theyre succeeding for the factors that we talked about i think when you look over time and envision these fintechs with tremendous growth and being large disruptors it is an elephant in the room relative to whats the regulatory context the capital that theyre going to be carrying the regulatory requirements and the levelness of the playing field so we certainly have a watchful eye on that but when we look at the fintechs the success were seeing in them to me is indicative of the opportunity that exists to reimagine banking and thats what weve been focused on for years and then if we kind of take our focus off fintechs for a minute and think about capital one like the fintechs we have a modern technology infrastructure based in the cloud we also have other benefits they dont have ph i think most of them we have tremendous customer scale a powerful brand and literally decades of underwriting and banking experience so when i pull up i think we and the fintechs are well positioned for success in some ways for the same reasons in some ways for different reasons but i think the biggest takeaway of all of this is that the banking industry is changing on an accelerated basis the competition is unbelievably and increasingly wellfunded and we look at that and we say it indicates the magnitude of change the magnitude of the opportunity but it also indicates an imperative that we need to make sure that during the windows of opportunity that we lean in and invest where we need to invest because these opportunities wont last forever thank you don jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you next well hear from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i guess i had a followup question on the opportunity in the us card for growth i assume a lot of the account growth that youre seeing right now is coming in the super prime or the transactor space because of the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 growth in transaction volumes is that correct and i guess if we think about the subprime consumer maybe you can just talk about what their behaviors are today and how you see growth from that segment unfolding thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp sanjay certainly whats the biggest newsworthy thing thats happening in the short run is the surge on the super prime side the return to travel and entertainment spend powered a lot by heavy spenders and that you just can feel in a sense the world pent up and just bursting out and i think thats sort of the biggest news that we see inside our numbers as we look at it the subprime business i think has been more a characteristic of in general the sort of mass market of america and that is that things have not been as dramatic in terms of pullbacks nor are they as dramatic in terms of leaning in but weve just continued to take the same strategy weve had in the subprime business really in the prime business for years and we are carefully leaning into originations and growing the underlying franchise and then at the right opportunities raising the lines when we feel that the opportunity and the conditions warrant it so we continue to lean into originations really across our business and we are opening up credit lines gradually opening up credit lines because we see good results the consumer is in a pretty good position our customers are in a good place and you remember sanjay we talked about the sort of years of holding back on that its not like were unleashing with credit lines right now but we are sort of netnet more on the opening up side than the tightening side at the moment and thats of course with a watchful eye on all the key indicators and things that naturally will change because of how credit markets work jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so rich you mentioned several times that youre leaning into marketing i guess from the outside looking in how should we assess the return on these investments should it come in the form of accelerating growth or improved efficiency and i guess rich just on the efficiency point we obviously saw improvement yearover year for the first time in several quarters it seems like the top line should be improving this combined with the technology investments that youre making at what point do you think youll be ready to reintroduce the efficiency target or what do we need to see for you to reinstate a timeline for that thanks capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thanks well first a word on marketing as i said to betsy we are leaning into the marketing right now and sort of leaning a little further into it because what we do is always so windowsdriven as you know ryan and so thats where we are on the marketing side so from an efficiency point of view you notice pretty high levels of spending on marketing marketing goes up marketing goes down but that at the moment has been more on the upside let me turn and one thing i want to say about competition if i could just because this is very relevant to these growth conversations and then ill pivot to the efficiency point most competitors have been the feel of their earnings calls is they too are leaning in to the opportunities that they see at the moment and we see this we see competition heating up all around us especially in rewards where typically thats kind of the flashpoints where you see these things the most but you see it in the marketing and the media activity we see it in direct mail numbers we see it in the rewards offerings and the heating up of some of that competition is intense right now ryan but its not yet irrational but i want to just kind of take the moment to reflect on what i call sort of the physics of competitive cycles because ive seen this enough that its pretty much you can count on these things happening now timing is always the question but right now credit is historically good across the industry and the consumer is in great shape the longer this persists the more competition will likely be to extrapolate these trends to inform their decision making and this can embolden them to make more aggressive offers market more intensely and a particular one i worry about loosening underwriting standards and in this particular environment the benign rearview mirror could encourage lenders to reach for growth and it could be exacerbated by credit modeling that relies on consumer credit data that frankly may be very unique to the downturn and not as good for predicting where credit performance is going to be over time ryan if youre building a credit model right now and youre looking back at the data on the last year or two what are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down and theres also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system and then youve got the fintechs that are really revving up as i talked about earlier so even as were leaning into this opportunity we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle in the credit cycle these seeds are being planted right now and so what we do is we dont just look at our models to make decisions we pull way up and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these not only likely basically inevitable things to happen and then we will act accordingly we just never want to be surprised let me turn to talk about operating efficiency weve been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years and from to we delivered basis points of improvement with the combination of revenue growth and tight expense management and of course the pandemic interrupted our progress particularly on revenue growth now as it turns out the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and frankly particularly in banking and so as i talked about earlier i think everyone can feel the clock ticking companies everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their techreadiness the investment flowing into fintechs the arms race for talent and so we are struck by the emerging opportunities in the marketplace theyre significant but the windows arent unlimited capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 so we feel were very wellpositioned on this but we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and in the opportunities that we see out there so meanwhile we continue to focus on operating efficiency our tech transformation is the engine of longterm efficiency gains both through revenue growth and digital productivity gains so continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a shared path so were still driving toward the same destination of operating efficiency but the timing of operating efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace and delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key element of how we deliver longterm shareholder value thanks ryan jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator absolutely next well hear from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you rich as you think about the process of normalization of payment rates and revolve rates that you described would you expect that to provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth such that we could actually see loan growth outpace spending growth as we look ahead richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp i think one of the things that i think the banking industry i mean weve talked about this relationship between payment rates and growth from time to time but i think its been more of an occasional conversation with the street and i think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly wasnt talked about that much which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and in fact credit performance and the striking thing is its not only empirical that relationship but its intuitive as well which to me really reinforces theres something very important here now as ive said to you we kind of root for higher payment rates because i think it reflects a healthier consumer even and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes pay very well as you can see here but it is a natural thing that will happen over time the normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of payment rates and that in turn is likely sort of mathematically all other things being equal that will be a boost to loan growth so when you say but i think for those numbers to move significantly enough to in fact have loan growth lead the rate of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or for us originations and things like that thats got quite a journey to do to get there im not saying that it wont but i wouldnt run to the bank counting on a loan growth topping the league tables of the various growth metrics but i think what is baking what really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit correspondingly for the same reason a lowering of payment rates and we are probably seeing the very early sort of on a monthly basis the very early indicators of that phenomenon capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our final question today comes from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good afternoon rich appreciated your comments on fintech and how youre looking at partnering buying and et cetera but i just was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color and your thoughts around what areas of fintech i know its been a few years since you bought paribus the online price tracking but theres a lot of it as you talked about all that investment its going into a very broad group of whether its buy now pay later b2b payments wealth management business spend management kind of charge card business spend management areas so i just wondered what areas are most attractive to you where we would see partnerships or acquisitions richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well bob what we do is and you mentioned a bunch of interesting areas for example but what we do is rather than say these three areas are our priority areas and lets go look for fintechs we have a and its really one of the benefits of years on our tech transformation is we see opportunities in a lot of areas across the portfolio of businesses that were in and so rather than say these three here are the priority and lets go see what we can partner with or buy what we do is we massively study the fintech marketplace across all the areas that we are also leaning into frankly we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot and then what we do is the sheer learning alone is worth the effort and so we go to school on this and we try to say and a bunch of times we say wow look at that they thought of that idea we didnt at capital one their good our bad but look lets see what we can learn from that but also along the way we look across that continuum of partnering investing or buying these things but as we really look from the other end of the telescope rather than what we need what we look for is what do we find and especially what do we find relative to a company with the talent and the culture and the business model that would be really accelerative to us and so every once in a while we do an acquisition but there is a lot of focus on that particular business model we always ask ourselves could we build that rather than buy it and then we really look hard at the talent because in the end what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes and stays and leads becomes leading executives in the company and so thats how it works and a lot of times we dont buy anything but we always come out having learned a lot bob thank you jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp well thanks everybody for joining
