kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning as always ill make some brief comments about our third quarter earnings before turning the call over to dale who will review our financial results in more detail after i discuss our outlook for the remainder of tim bruckner will join us for qa western alliance delivered solid third quarter results and earned per share these results demonstrated the banks ability to sustain and diversify loan and deposit momentum as well as grow earnings during a changing rate environment we produced healthy deposit growth of billion or annualized and hfi loan growth of million or annualized despite sluggish demand for overall credit in the economy our national diversified credit origination and deposit platforms uniquely positioned us to sustain strong deposit growth and then deploy this liquidity into attractive commercial loans where we can provide deep segment and product expertise during a transitional period for the rate cycle that began in q3 net interest income grew annualized due to higher average earning assets net interest margin compressed basis points because of lower yields on variable rate loans continued interest rate cuts will enable western alliance to realize significant funding cost savings in both interest bearing and ecrrelated deposits going forward we anticipate a more meaningful benefit from lower rates in q4 from a full quarter impact of lower rates q3 results were modestly impacted by billion of mortgage warehouse deposit growth driven by elevated mortgage refinance volumes validating our operational excellence as we continue to win market share following several competitors retreating from the market after the money center banks western alliance is now the largest western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 bank operating in this space this excess deposit growth somewhat impacted q3 earnings from elevated deposit costs but these deposits have helped cement core customer relationships which will continue to drive strong riskadjusted loan volume and spread income typical seasonal declines in mortgage warehouse deposit balances are poised to push q4 ecrrelated deposit costs materially lower noninterest income increased million or quarteroverquarter but this growth was tempered by a decline in mortgage banking income our franchise remains poised to specifically benefit from a resumption of stronger mortgage volume preprovision net revenue grew marginally from q2 while tangible book value per share climbed yearoveryear lastly asset quality remained stable as nonperforming assets to total assets declined basis points to basis points net chargeoffs of basis points landed within our street guidance range dale will now take you through the results in more detail dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken during the quarter western alliance generated preprovision net revenue of million net income of million and earnings per share of net interest income increased million from q2 to million equating nearly annualized growth because of higher average earning asset balances driven by loan growth noninterest income of million rose million quarteroverquarter from higher service charges and loan fees benefiting from commercial banking fees and a new bank owned life insurance policy which along with securities gains helped mitigate lower mortgage banking income securities gains were taken as we sold the collateral held for a large bankruptcy deposit as it went into distribution mortgage loan production rose from q2 and yearoveryear loan servicing revenue was negatively impacted by prepayment speeds accelerating due to the declining rate environment which caused a negative change in the msr fair value net of hedging of million noninterest expense for the quarter was million deposit costs of million drove the quarteroverquarter increase due to strong demand in mortgage warehouse in aggregate net interest income growth exceeded deposit growth by million this quarter it is important to emphasize the recent 50basispoint reduction in the fed funds target rate occurred less than two weeks before the end of q3 consequently rate reduction actions for ecrrelated deposits were also back loaded seasonal outflows in mortgage warehouse from q4 tax and insurance payments and a full quarter impact of lower rates make us confident q3 will prove to be the high watermark in ecrrelated deposit costs for this rate cycle provision expense of million resulted from sustained loan growth and million of net chargeoffs the balance sheet remained at approximately billion as solid loan and deposit growth were offset by securities and cash declining billion quarteroverquarter and a further billion reduction in periodend borrowings a large distribution of bankruptcy settlement funds drove a notable decline in juris banking deposits which allowed us to sell the collateralizing securities loans held for investment grew million to over billion while deposits grew billion to billion at quarter end tangible book value per share continues its expansion rising quarteroverquarter to and was aided by a large improvement in our aoci position loan growth of million resulted from large contributions from regional banking as well as mortgage warehouse and msr lending we continue to diversify the loan portfolio as shown by ci loans growing over billion yearoveryear and now accounting for of the held for investment western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 loan portfolio compared to one year ago at the same time we lowered the overall allocation for commercial real estate investor and cld categories from to deposit growth of billion was generated from seasonal inflows in mortgage warehouse which grew billion while our consumer digital channel increased billion and continued to add more granular deposits uncorrelated with our commercial banking business lines homeowners association deposits also posted growth in a seasonally softer quarter as mentioned before juris banking deposits decreased billion overall core deposit growth was billion as we modestly reduced wholesale broker deposits by approximately million turning to our net interest drivers the yield on total securities increased basis points to our liquidity position remains solid as unencumbered highquality liquid assets were of securities and cash while securities and cash were of total assets hfi loan yields decreased basis points to due to asset repricing for sofr type loans in advance of the feds rate decision the cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points higher as a result of billion of quarterly deposit growth in our consumer digital channel the total cost of funds declined basis points to due to the deposit mix shifting toward noninterest bearing and a smaller proportion of earning assets funded by borrowings if you compare the difference between the periodend spot rates and average rates for the quarter youll see that the difference is wider for interest bearing deposits compared to hfi loans in other words we are seeing funding cost tailwinds emerge outside of just ecr related funding in aggregate net interest income increased million from higher average earning asset balances and loan growth net interest margin compressed basis points from q2 to which would have been flat but for the new boli policy as million of earning assets were deployed for this purpose regarding interest rate sensitivity western alliance is liability sensitive on an earnings at risk basis with a dynamic balance sheet at minus basis point rate ramp analysis indicates pretax interest sensitive earnings should increase in this scenario the expected negative impact on net interest income would be more than offset by expected reductions in ecr related deposit costs as well as a pickup in mortgage banking income that a lower rate environment should unleash our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was modestly higher operating expense growth compared to revenue growth drove the basis point increase from last quarter excluding the impact of the fdic special assessment rebate in q2 this ratio would have remained flat quarteroverquarter asset quality continues to remain relatively stable in q2 criticized assets rose million as special mention loans declined million while classified assets increased million criticized assets are up only million from a year ago we expect the total criticized asset pool to remain relatively stable nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets declined basis points to basis points due to payoffs and sales our non performing assets consist primarily of cre office loans which is unsurprising given the environment characterized by still elevated interest rates and lower office property valuations quarterly net loan chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans provision expense of million added reserves in concert with loan growth in addition to replenishing net chargeoffs our acl for funded loans rose million from the prior quarter to million the total loan acl to funded loan ratio of basis points was unchanged and covers of nonperforming loans western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 slide shows the updated acl lock we have regularly provided to add more context behind our allowance methodology relative to peers our acl lifts from basis points to when incorporating the effect of credit linked notes which have provided a pool of prepaid insurance money to us to cover chargeoffs as well as low to no loss loans like equity fund resources or low ltv and high fico residential portfolio and mortgage warehouse loans compared to the billion to billion asset peer banks we benefit from a greater cln support as well as a greater percentage of loans in low to no loss categories our cet1 ratio increased approximately basis points to our tangible common equity to total assets ratio moved up approximately basis points from q2 to as our all other comprehensive income loss position recovered substantially due to a lower rate environment given the conversation about basel iii endgame capital i also mentioned that our cet1 ratio excluding aoci and our loss reserve is which is basis points above the second quarter adjusted cet1 ratio of and ranks in the top quartile of our asset class peers finally tangible book value per share increased quarteroverquarter to from earnings growth and our negative aoci position improving by almost one third our consistent upward trajectory in tangible book value per share has outpaced peers by tenfold since the end of even when incorporating q3 data for peers which is not yet available wals relative performance will still be well in excess of their tpv growth ill now turn the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale following our q3 results we updated our and q4 guidance as follows we expect loan growth of approximately billion next quarter to be achieved in a safe sound and thoughtful manner our current hfi loan to deposit ratio provides ample flexibility to selectively originate attractive loans deposits are expected to temporarily decline billion in q4 due to typical seasonal outflows of property tax and insurance payments in mortgage warehouse and active management of our deposit mix to maximize deposit betas and lower the cost of interest bearing and ecr related deposit costs turning to capital we reiterate that our cet1 ratio will remain at as loan growth continues net interest income is expected to decline approximately next quarter due to market tied variable loans repricing slightly ahead of funding costs this dynamic is a function of the transitional period to a lower rate environment that got underway in q3 however ecr related deposit costs are expected to significantly decline by approximately quarteroverquarter in q4 and outpace a decline in net interest income we expect net interest margin incorporating operating ecr costs to have bottomed in q3 and to experience continued expansion into future periods noninterest income should increase around to next quarter from traction in cultivating commercial banking fee opportunities and firming mortgage banking income noninterest expense should decline between and mostly from the expected drop in ecr related deposit costs given the pivot in the rate environment and the typical q4 seasonal factors previously discussed asset quality remains in line with our expectations we expect steady net chargeoffs in q4 in the basis point area which implies full year net chargeoffs should be no greater than basis points we believe this will still rank among the best of our peers lastly the effective tax rate for full year is now estimated to fall between and western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 at this time dale tim and i look forward to answering your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess first just first question around deposits trying to understand im assuming you were aware of the seasonality last quarter when you raised the deposit guidance for the year so im just trying to understand if you can give us a little color on the settlement that impact and how pronounced is the seasonality versus just some of these chunkier outflows and are there more such deposits that could leave the bank that could have some meaningful impact on nearterm nii trajectory just if you can address nii both in terms of larger outflows and then how impactful is the seasonality because im not sure it was that prevalent in fourth quarter of last year thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thanks ebrahim i think youve confused a few things so let me straighten that out number one in q3 we did see a very large settlement out of our juris banking group that was a little bit earlier than our expectations we had expected it to happen into the settlement moved up earlier always hard to forecast when those things are going to happen dependent on the court system and it depends on lawyers agreeing to what the settlement terms are so that came out and so absent that we would have grown deposits in q3 by billion so we actually grew deposits billion we paid down million of brokered deposits and that got us to the net growth of billion in q4 thats when youll see the seasonal decline of warehouse lending group which we always have in terms of deposits flowing out for escrow insurance and pi payments that happen at the end of the year and thats why weve said that outflow will push q4s deposit levels down billion however our balance sheet deposit growth or ill say our balance sheet growth all in as you move forward into certainly for deposits remains unchanged which is we expect to have billion per quarter on average billion per quarter of deposit growth we have a good line of sight into that weve got clarity into that because of the number of homegrown deposit platforms that we have built over the years starting with our granddaddy which is the hoa business also our warehouse lending group has a very strong deposit business and we added business escrow services in the last two years settlement services sometimes known as juris banking and our western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 consumer digital platform as well and also corporate trust so these are all homegrown deposit businesses that a couple of years ago really never existed inside of our bank and now are beginning to perform admirably in addition weve got good deposit growth that comes from our commercial lines of business or previously known as the regional business so thats sort of the deposits and while just on balance sheet ill just say and we also expect as we move forward into to see deposit loan growth average billion or so per quarter and were running a very a much lower loantodeposit ratio so if we have the opportunity to put on as we say good safe and thoughtful loan growth we have the liquidity to do that and we could increase our loan growth throughout the year dale some of these businesses report to you do you want to add any comments dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah no i think thats pretty fulsome ken but maybe an addition yeah so we see that we have kind of the liquidity that we need to be able to proceed and as such pushing up our loantodeposit ratio into the from below presently on an hfi basis we should be able to do that and there isnt anything like this ebrahim on the balance sheet ph fill i mean this was our largest depositor in the whole bank and so there isnt maybe followthrough coming in q4 q1 or whatever kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah ebrahim i think we might have left that one of the last pieces of your question you asked did i hear correctly sort of directionally whats going to happen with net interest income was that one of your questions as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc it was going to be my followup so yes please i think youve given the guidance just talk to us how that goes nii plus ecr deposit cost with or without rate cuts kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well i kind of feel like i asked your question for you i might as well answer it all right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right please share thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so as we look forward first our rate outlook is for two more cuts this year november and december and then we have four scheduled for next year at the end of each quarter is the way we forecasted it all right so what youll see overall when you look at our balance sheet inclusive of deposit costs we are liabilitysensitive so our adjusted net interest margin thats net interest margin less deposit costs will rise in q4 and will continue to rise western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 throughout and net interest income less deposit costs okay those dollars will continue to rise steadily in q4 and then as you roll forward into for the obvious reasons deposit costs are declining okay so that helps plus the balance sheet growth is going to still remain robust and youll get some volume pickup in that as well for the net interest income less deposit costs growing throughout from and actually q4 should be higher than q3 as well if i wasnt clear enough on that okay ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc okay all very clear ill let jon arfstrom ask you whether or not you can earn plus next year thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw chris please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning dale wondering if you could help or ken on the outlook for noninterest income for the fourth quarter i know this quarter had an msr adjustment but maybe unpack the to growth in fees for q4 because some of the line items moved around a little bit thanks dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean the msr piece i mean a lot of that was really related to the turn in rates so we saw a increase in constant prepayment rates on our mortgage book just at the initiation of kind of lower mortgage rates which is to a significant degree kind of backtracked presently we dont see that happening again but maybe there was a little more pentup behavior than we thought and so the result of that is the value of that asset fell more than what the gain would have on what we put against it to hold the valuation constant and then going forward so we talked about a couple of things so one of them is we did a boli transaction thats going to continue and those new revenues will be consistent there you can see what we have in terms of kind of service charges it was up from the second quarter we think that that number is also consistent we had some securities gains we do have some other collateralized deposits not nearly of the magnitude that we talked about with the one that went into distribution in the third quarter so i think were probably going to have some more security gains too as we sell off the collateral related to those all of that really actually improves our liquidity because when you have a collateralized deposit you really cant do anything else with it as these things as were able to move that and substitute different deposit situations for that it gives us an opportunity to really push into higher return assets than what its in presently christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just i guess my followup the security gains you mentioned is that in the guide and i guess with a similar magnitude western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah it would be in the guide for a smaller magnitude than what we had in the third quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay operator our next question comes from jared shaw with barclays jared please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah maybe looking at the loan growth that you had you referenced especially on the ci side where are you seeing opportunities for that and maybe if you could just give us a little bit of early look at in terms of sort of the pipelines and the expectation for the sustainability of that growth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so as i said this quarter we grew million thats about annualized to total loans of about billion it really came from three or four segments of our portfolio the regional group grew all in about million warehouse lending grew almost million some leveraged finance and some resort financing when you combine those together grew another million so it was almost million million million almost or million million and million that got us to nearly billion of loan growth for this quarter so as we look going forward we see a couple of areas that give us confidence to continue to restate and reiterate the guide of billion in quarterly loan growth first our note financing msr lending warehouse lending group businesses are showing good pipelines and we like this type of financing because theyre generally shorter duration loans good risk reward and they also allow us to evaluate credit decisions and collateral on a continuous basis which goes to our allowance for loan loss reserves and it goes to our lower credit losses that we have that this is good collateral but also weve never taken a loss in any of those categories since weve been in these businesses then i would say lot banking resort financing and our regional commercial lending provides the additional value or added value of growing our loans but also provides loan growth that comes along with more treasury management fee income and also allows us to gather lower cost operating accounts and so thats another area that we like western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 overall if you look at our performance yeartodate we really have focused more on the ci side and you see our total growth for the year has been all on ci and weve downplayed construction lending and development and weve also kept our cre owner occupied flat as well and that hasnt grown and weve also taken down all residential loans which carry a lower yield to it so well have some opportunity to put some when we put new loans on the books to have them come in at a higher yield so i hope that kind of gives you a sense of how were thinking about and what were doing to prepare for it jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats good thanks and then just as my followup looking at capital with the sort of i wont call it target but calling out were above that should we expect you to continue to grow cet1 from this too or would there be other capital management alternatives that youd utilize here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah yeah i understand the question so for our forecasting for we are assuming cet1 stays at or above and stays there modestly at or above because we think there is going to be or there could be more loan growth coming our way than the billion per quarter and we want to have that cet1 dry powder to support that and thats sort of our going in program in addition as we get bigger okay i know were billion and our total assets came down a little bit from q2 to q3 but as we get bigger and we get closer to the category for bank comparisons which we do today we look at other measurements of where adjusted cet1 is that cet1 less the aoci plus the allowance for loan loss reserves and we want to target being in that upper quartile that dale discussed in his prepared remarks and so were looking at that as well as a way to guide us as we continue to grow operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler matthew please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone thank you first question around the ecr related costs given the volume and rate dynamic going forward and assuming either your rate assumptions that you laid out earlier or the forward curve what is a good range of expectations for customer service cost dollars in dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so the reason why its been increasing is really related to its become skewed more towards the mortgage warehouse which has about beta and so we expect that to unwind in a similar fashion as it came in hence kens comment that we believe were going to see a reduction in these ecr costs in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and that should continue as we go into next year again so we had a scenario whereby our hoa deposits have consistently risen yearin yearout we expect that to continue while the growth in our mortgage warehouse is going to be tempered youre going to see an outflow primarily related to insurance payments that are made in the fourth quarter and thats whats going to pull the total deposit number down but its also going to be an area of less focus for us kind of going forward in terms of growth western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 so in other words were going to have an opportunity to be able to lower those costs kind of in lockstep to fomc action and in fact in some cases above kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah and to answer because you asked the dollar question dale gave you a percentage answer but that ish percent for q4 is about a million decline timothy r bruckner a chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp million kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp million million im sorry im sorry my bad million decline from q2 to q3 right just remember q2 to im sorry q3 to q4 i meant to say its about million and remember you got that basis point bang that came out of q3 so dont model that as a million per quarter but model it as rates coming down in a very methodical way matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay so it sounds like its more rate driven not volume driven kind of okay got it okay and then just on the your kind of a blended question around loan yields i know sofr came down ahead of the fed cuts and im sure that hurt a little bit it also looked like your loan fees came down to basis points from bps in the prior quarter and they had been running around that level for a few quarters i guess just what happened there and then how do we think about the overall nim in the near term dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think i think the loan fee number is really i mean you should go with the kind of the current run rate that we had in that period in terms of the nim i mean we mentioned in our slide that on a net interest income basis alone were expecting to see a contraction in the fourth quarter but that will be more than made up for so as ken talked about earlier were looking for a combined nim including the ecrs which we expect that the low watermark was actually in the third quarter of and will increase in each successive quarter through next year operator the next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank bernard please go ahead bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank hey guys good morning just on mortgage you previously obviously guided to being seasonally weaker with the loan production volumes were up nicely versus while the gain on sale margins declined and obviously you called out the negative msr mark could you just talk to the puts and takes on how high demand maybe needs to pick up to see a pickup in gain on sale margins western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp that is something that is a little difficult to handicap to be very honest with you coming into the quarter mortgage rates at the end of q2 were up around right and they declined during the quarter to about and today theyre in the area and so for us to handicap that thats been a little bit of a struggle its based on consumer behavior of cost and its also based on consumer timing ie if you know there are a couple of other rate cuts coming at you would you go out today and buy a home when you know rates are coming and so what we say in the mortgage business is at least what we have been saying is people love their mortgage rate they hate their home and now were trying to see if people want to find a new home and just rent their mortgage rate and then refi as they go forward bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank okay and then just as we think about maybe mortgage more broadly and just the dynamics like you mentioned with mortgage rates coming down closer to and then backing up what really gets mortgage for you guys i think in the past youve said maybe like three four rate cuts kind of help and maybe a low is really whats meaningful to increase production but just kind of want to get your thoughts like maybe the hopefully comes down again but it is based on some of the pull forward of the rate cut expectation so just want to get your thoughts on maybe a mortgage rate level that you think the production volumes kind of pick up and revenues follow kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think if you start beginning to see a repeat of the early part of q3 where rates coming down into the low that begins to pick up the volume you then begin to gather some speed once you break the barrier the barrier is the equivalent of the for those that remember the 4minute breaking the 4minute mile okay and once you break that 4minute mile of under and have a handle to begin with then we really think if the sweet spot is somewhere in that to thats record thats great opportunities for us okay and thats sort of how we think so we need to break the barrier and then as it drops into that area thats where we think theres a lot more volume coming our way dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i might say a more tempered rate decline we actually think works in our favor and that is if things fall really suddenly i think its going to maybe have almost a rush of refinance that may not last as much and part of the reason why mortgage rates are elevated relative to the 10year is we believe its simply because theres the expectation that if you refi right now youre going to refi again in six months and its not going to be worth all the processing cost to get that done and so if that view were to dissipate a little bit and frankly im pleased that the number of expectations of rate cuts for has actually been cut a little bit in the futures market at least that that really makes it more sustainable over time and with that we think we can maybe see a reduction in the disparity between mortgage rates and the 10year treasury for example from what its been historically western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 operator the next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo timur please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning i wanted to just kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc get some clarity on the expectation for to be the nii trough is the expectation that maybe you get some additional margin compression from the assetsensitive balance sheet and then volume makes it up or should be the trough for nim compression as well dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i believe is going to be the trough as well on the nim side yes timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just to maybe to put a finer point on bernies question so for the earningsatrisk analysis i guess what are you assuming for mortgage rates and kind of mortgage revenues within that earningsatrisk analysis dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we would tail into maybe something that ticks into a by the end of next year a handle high5 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and then just last thing for me just sure kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp sorry i just wanted to add a point to dales comments when talking about nim he was referencing the adjusted nim okay and so that when you think about it thats the way i think about it is that adjusted nim is just net interest income less the deposit costs that is all going to flow upward or move upward throughout the year okay i just want to make that little clarification sorry i didnt mean to interrupt timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no i appreciate that clarification at the end and just lastly for me just thinking about hqla deposits in a rate down environment im assuming just the shortterm nature there is going to be a little bit punitive to nii just how western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 are you thinking about hqla levels growing maybe commensurate with the asset base or asset growth and then what that might look like from a rate perspective dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we think were kind of intact in terms of where we are on what we have in hqla presently that number kind of came down a little bit because we disposed of some of these deposits that were collateralized all with hqla categories so from here again it gives us latitude to grow our loans commensurate with the growth rate were going to show in deposits and so as ken mentioned so if were going to grow deposits billion on average and that means that includes like the fourth quarter decline thats already built into higher growth earlier in those quarters and then if you can grow at youre going to have billion of loan growth to match that and then the rest of it is going to fall into other categories like hqla operator our next question comes from the line of anthony elian with jpmorgan please go ahead anthony anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone does your deposit guide of down billion include any additional paydowns of broker deposits or is the decline really coming from the seasonality of warehouse dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp its really seasonality of warehouse we expect our broker deposits to be fairly flat anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then my followup also on deposits i understand the warehouse is going to seasonally outflow in but i guess are there not enough deposit opportunities from other areas of the company to be able to offset that seasonal headwind for this quarter specifically thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so the other deposit channels do in fact negate some of that outflow that youre seeing but the wealth lending group is a larger contributor to deposit growth and the other thing thats happening and i cant i really should emphasize this is that in the warehouse lending group or the industry weve had several competitors either leave the industry or retreat from it in a significant way and we are just seeing more inflow than we would normally have expected and that inflow came in in q3 and will kind of reverse out in q4 so thats why its harder to have the other deposit channels cover that larger inflow for us in q4 but after these deposits go on a hiatus as we call them they do come back starting in q1 and will help us with our liquidity as we roll forward throughout operator the next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson gary please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 thanks good morning i appreciate the kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co further thoughts on the combined nii and ecr costs i just wonder if youre willing to put a finer dime on just the gaap nii outlook obviously the fourth quarter is a lower guide based on your rate forecast for next year kind of the basis points per quarter how deep into the year would you think it would be and so you could turn dollars of gaap nii from a bottom kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp at this point i think weve given more clarity around and what we expect than any other conference call that ive read about so far and were going to leave it here as we announce our q4 earnings well get into more detail what that full year is going to look like but i think weve given plenty of guidance here on how to kind of construct what to expect in gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you operator the next question comes from the line of samuel varga with ubs please go ahead samuel samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning dale i just wanted to touch on the ecr rates again i wanted to get your sense for lets say if the fed funds normalizes around the that a lot of people are pegging what would be the floor on ecr rates i understand that the beta at least initially is expected to be near but at what point does it just level off and not move lower dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i mean if you look to kind of where we were before when rates were even lower than that during the pandemic our ecrs mostly bottomed out around basis points so theres still a lot of room to continue to push things down and frankly i mean its all about whats the alternative for money in these so its like okay so they have these funds is some other financial institution going to be paying more than what like a number in your example i think itll be paying i doubt it because that generally means that funds are available elsewhere so we have these diversified funding sources so that weve got all these channels so that we can meet kind of the credit demand that we have so i dont see that there is a number there that were going to really its going to really get sticky in terms of pushing things lower as they were much lower before and there are alternatives for and not just for but there western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 are alternatives for us if we can go to other sectors as well and look for funds so i mean theyre not going to move that far away from what the market rate for money is in terms of how low it can go samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc yeah got it thank you for that and then just my followup on the earnings at risk can you give us a sense obviously its hard for us to know exactly what youre assuming on mortgage but can you give us a sense for i guess what helps more in offsetting the nii compression is it the cras or the mortgage benefit from amerihome on the fee income side dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp what offsets the mortgage income on the fee income side well i mean so i mean they have funds that come from kind of their origination of mortgage servicing right so they manufacture these and depending on what that estimated value is kind of determines what the gain on sale is and then we have the servicing rights that we value and amortize down so thats why i look at them more in concert rather than kind of a singular element i think it was more important in the third quarter where they were more ill say bifurcated in terms of the response and that was really related to this increase we had in constant prepayment rates that took place in august that was in excess of i think what most models would have captured operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks for the followup dale or ken longerterm question about roe potential in a down rate environment how are you thinking about roe over the next couple of years dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we dont think that our roe potential is really that dependent upon the rate environment that is based on the balance sheet that we have the capital that we need the spreads that we can obtain that we can continue to efficiently manage the organization we know our costs have come up for the past couple of years or so but we believe were going to get back to an efficiency ratio that begins with a instead of a on an adjusted basis ie with the deposit costs netted against interest income and so that should leave us with a rotce in the upper teens and we believe were on our way to get there and frankly thats kind of where were headed were not going to get back to the that we were at before because our leverage is lower with our higher cet1 ratio christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood thanks a lot dale operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc jon please go ahead western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc ebrahim set me up i guess but ken i hear you on your thoughts are you more optimistic on with the recent rate cuts and the current rate outlook is this good for the company generally kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah yeah i am my optimism comes first from the balance sheet right weve given that guide of billion for loans and billion on average for deposits right and weve been giving that guide for boy for seems like a couple of years now that we continue to do that and i think we have these credit origination platforms that work well and over the years weve added the deposit platforms and so my confidence is in i feel very strong strongly about the guide that we can achieve the balance sheet the overall liability sensitive nature of the bank i think in a falling rate environment as dale talked about and were talking about this on an adjusted net interest income basis inclusive of deposit costs with rate cuts coming at us we see that getting better and so that gives me some confidence as well asset quality as we see it today is stable knock on wood and so yeah i always believe next year is always going to be both more difficult than the previous year but i always tend to have a higher level of confidence that we can get there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay you guys you use the word transitional a lot and i understand that it feels like this was kind of an unusual quarter for you and i hear you on transitional but do you have like a nongaap core eps number in your mind for the quarter i mean i think youve got msr boli i dont know gains lower gain on sale ecr pressure theres a lot going on and i guess itd be helpful if you have some kind of a shot at like a repeatable sustainable quarterly eps run rate in your mind just because there was a lot i think a lot going on here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think thats a fair question we kind of get to which is what was reported the decline from the mortgage business was offset by gains from the collateralized deposits that the securities that help collateralize deposits and those two things kind of equal out for us and as we dont think were going to see that msr valuation decline in q4 and as dale said that we have other collateralized deposits and settlements that are rolling off where we have gains in q4 that i think it was chris who asked the question that we think its captured in the run rate western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 operator our next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist brandon please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey just one for me on core expenses stripping out ecr deposit costs it looks like the core growth run rate was around in the quarter and taking your commentary on deposit costs next quarter seems like another step higher so that to quarterly run rate of growth is that something we should expect over the foreseeable future anything temporary within that core expense run rate over the next few quarters kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so the way id come out is is i think about it as the adjusted efficiency ratio as we come out of q4 through which excludes deposit fees and we think over the course of the year that that will get at or near by the end of so we see the adjusted efficiency ratio declining through brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and within that any sort of commentary on as far as the infrastructure build as you continue to grow towards ph obtaining the cat thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no thats embedded in there thats embedded in there operator those were all the questions we have and so ill turn the call back to ken vecchione for any closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you all for attending the call we look forward to talking to you in january about our q4 results so thanks again operator thank you everyone for joining us today this concludes our call
