million of net investment securities losses in corporate on page we have more on our fourth quarter results similar to prior quarters we have called out the impact of first republic where relevant youll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits which were previously in ccb to the appropriate lines of business for the quarter first republic contributed billion of revenue million of expense and million of net income jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 now focusing on the firmwide fourth quarter results excluding first republic revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear nii ex markets was up billion or predominantly driven by higher rates nir ex markets was up million or and markets revenue was up million or expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear predominantly driven by the fdic special assessment and higher compensation including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology and credit costs were billion reflecting net chargeoffs of billion and a net reserve build of million net chargeoffs were up billion predominantly driven by card and single name exposures in wholesale which were largely previously reserved the net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuations in the commercial bank looking at the full year results on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and revenue of billion and we delivered an rotce of on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up basis points versus the prior quarter primarily driven by net income oci gains and lower rwa partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed basel iii endgame requirements now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page total debit and credit card spend was up year onyear driven by strong account growth and consumer spend remained stable turning now to the financial results excluding first republic ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear in banking wealth management revenue was up yearonyear reflecting higher nii on higher rates largely offset by lower deposits with average balances down yearonyear client investment assets were up driven by market performance and strong net inflows in fact its been a record year for retail net new money in home lending revenue was up million predominantly driven by the absence of an msr loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher nii moving to card services auto revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were billion up as we gained market share while retaining strong margins expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by compensation including an increase in employees primarily in bankers advisors and technology and wage inflation as well as continued investments in marketing and technology in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion largely driven by net chargeoffs which were up million yearonyear predominantly due to continued normalization in card the net reserve build of million reflected loan growth in card next the cib on page the cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear ib fees were also up yearonyear and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of in advisory fees were up underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prioryear quarter with debt up and equity up we are starting the year with a healthy pipeline and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity but announced ma remains a headwind and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain payments revenue was billion up yearonyear excluding equity investments it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by depositrelated client credits jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear fixed income was a record fourth quarter up it was another strong quarter in our securitized products business which was partially offset by lower revenue in rates coming off a strong quarter last year equity markets was down driven by lower revenue in derivatives and cash securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by the timing of revenuerelated compensation credit costs were million reflecting net chargeoffs of million and a net reserve build of million moving to the commercial bank on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear largely driven by higher nii where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances payments revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by fee growth largely offset by depositrelated client credits gross investment banking and markets revenue of million was up yearonyear primarily reflecting increased capital markets and ma activity expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by an increase in employees including front office and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense including the impact of new client acquisition average deposits were down yearonyear primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarteronquarter as client balances are seasonally higher at yearend loans were down quarteronquarter ci loans were down reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious and cre loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity finally credit costs were million including net chargeoffs of million and a net reserve build of million driven by a deterioration in our commercial real estate valuation outlook and then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of million with pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels predominantly offset by lower nii the decrease in nii reflects lower deposit margins and balances partially offset by wider spreads on loans expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation including performancebased incentives continued growth in our private banking advisor teams the impact of closing jp morgan asset management china acquisition and the continued investment in global shares for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion positive across equities and fixed income and billion for the full year in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion for the quarter and net inflows of billion for the full year and we had record client asset net inflows billion for the year aum of trillion and client assets of trillion were both up yearonyear driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels and finally loans were up quarteronquarter and deposits were up quarteronquarter turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue of billion was up million yearonyear nii of billion was up billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix nir was a net loss of million compared with a net loss of million and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned upfront and expenses of billion were up billion yearon year predominantly driven by the fdic special assessment jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 with that lets pivot to the outlook for starting with nii on page we expect nii ex markets to be approximately billion going through the drivers the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve which currently includes six cuts this year on deposits we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels while lower rates should decrease repricing pressure we remain asset sensitive and therefore lower rates will decrease nii resulting in more normal deposit margins we expect strong loan growth in card to continue but not at the same pace as still this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates outside of card loan growth will likely remain muted its important to note that we just reported a quarterly nii ex markets run rate of billion combining that with the full year guidance of approximately billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout consistent with what weve been telling you for some time and keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that weve highlighted previously surrounding the nii outlook remain and on total nii we expect it to be approximately billion for the full year reflecting an increase in markets nii which as always you should think of as largely offset in nir now lets turn to expenses on page we expect adjusted expense to be about billion youll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business generally you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are both in terms of share and available returns and of course youll hear more at investor day and between now and then on the righthand side of the page weve highlighted some firmwide drivers thematically the biggest driver is what i might call business growth writ large within that narrowly defined volume and revenuerelated growth represents about billion of the increase across the company as a result of an improved nir outlook compared to about million in but in addition the ongoing growth of the company which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability is coming with increased expense across a range of categories the quantum of investment increase is comparable to last years increase and is driven by all the same themes bankers branches advisors technology as well as marketing net net first republic produces a modest increase in expenses but with a significantly lower exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts finally despite significantly lower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories its worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during and to support the future growth and profitability of the company weve included the fourth quarter exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the yearonyear increase in expense is already in the run rate now lets turn to page and cover credit and wrap up on credit we continue to expect the card net chargeoff rate to be below consistent with investor day guidance so in closing we shouldnt leave without noting what an outstanding year it was producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items were very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank everyone who made it possible at the same time we emphasized throughout the extent to which we were overearning as indicated by an rotce that is above our throughthecycle target as we turn to it shouldnt be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns but despite the expected dissipation of the tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties we remain optimistic about this franchises ability to produce jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 superior returns through a broad range of environments and this management team remains laserfocused on executing for shareholders clients and communities and with that lets open the line for qa question and answer section operator please stand by for our first question its coming from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank you may proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning thanks for all the comments on the net interest income any updates on that medium term outlook that youve put out there jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah matt not particularly updating i think youre referring to that billion number that wed put out there and i wouldnt exactly describe that as an outlook i think its more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning so not particularly necessary to revise the number but i just would point out again as we highlight on the page and as i highlighted in the prepared remarks that when you look at that billion exit rate and full year guidance of billion that implies obviously exiting below billion and some significant sequential decline so in that sense you can see us kind of marching on the path to that billion whether we ever get to the billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter whats your thought process on buybacks given the strong capital generation but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question and i think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on our organic capital generation so the normal capital hierarchy will apply but for now we plan to remain on a modest pace of buybacks consistent with that kind of billion net buyback a quarter number that weve talked about and that youve seen us do in light of the probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer as you said the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules and also just as a reminder the scb is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile so thats another factor that we need to keep in mind matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks matt operator next well go to the line of john mcdonald from autonomous research you may proceed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thanks jeremy could you give a little more color on whats baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah actually john this quarter thats all like pretty quiet so the weighted average unemployment rate number is still we didnt have any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers and our skew remains as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average unemployment of and whats in our central outlook which i think is something like sic peak of the current levels john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then just to follow up on the nii could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of fed cuts like whats the impact of a few fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if youre thinking four five six i know its complicated but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure yeah happy to do that john so i think probably the best way to do this is to look at our ear numbers so as you know we dont update that until the q but on an estimated basis its going to be a little bit lower so i think something like billion as opposed to billion so just round numbers about billion in ear i think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the ear weve been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger but just crudely i think as i noted we do remain asset sensitive thats one way to quantify it i would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that and hopefully that gives you enough to work with john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks operator next well go to the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 hey good morning maybe just to follow up in a different way on the nii question just in deposits can you jeremy discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts and then layering in if we do get six cuts does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits how are you thinking about all that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah both good questions so lets do reprice first so i think all else equal this more dovish fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice especially productlevel reprice at the same time we do continue to expect internal migration particularly out of checking and savings into cds and in wholesale a little bit of ongoing migration out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing and that trajectory i would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment so as a result if you look at weighted average rate paid for example for the consumer deposit franchise we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher just even in a world with six cuts and thats actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into cds but maybe a little nonintuitive if youre kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid it gets a little bit nonintuitive and then in terms of balances yeah youll note that i said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down which when you consider the qt despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted its a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates so i kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin a little bit more supportive for systemwide deposit balances and then obviously we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay thanks a lot operator next well go to the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess maybe one question looking at your statement and i think jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the consumer as resilient and the market expecting a soft landing i would love to hear im not sure jamies on the call but maybe jeremy i would love to hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased is the market pricing in correctly or when you look at your customer base are you still worried about the lagged effects of the rate hikes jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right okay ebrahim so i think a lot of those things arent actually mutually exclusive so statement one i think its uncontroversial that the economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing thats i think the consensus at this point so whether you believe it or not is a separate issue but i think that is the consensus jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 in terms of consumer resilience i made some comments about this on the press call the way we see it the consumer is fine all of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized and the question really in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal but that that means that consumers have been spending more than theyre taking in is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were so one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take but i do think its important to take a step back and remind ourselves that consistent with that soft landing view just in the central case modeling obviously we always worry about the tail scenarios is a very strong labor market and a very strong labor market means all else equal strong consumer credit so thats how we see the world ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and maybe just taking that a step further there has been concern around whether we see some of the cre pain filter into multifamily apartments you all have a pretty large multifamily exposure high quality but just give us a sense of one are you seeing any bleedthrough of what weve seen in office in other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of ci lending thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so good question on the multifamily and the short answer is that for us its pretty uncontroversially no no bleedthrough and the reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multifamily thats in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually big in so its higherend stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pressure and as you know our multifamily portfolio is much more affordable supply constrained markets and so the performance there remains really very robust ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator next well go to the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is a followup on matts with regarding the buyback you printed cet1 in the quarter on a net basis net of rwa growth your net income produces basis points every quarter again thats net of rwa growth im wondering what guideposts youre looking for jeremy in terms of that buyback increasing from that billion a quarter do we need to wait for basel iii finalization which seems like it could be quite delayed or will having clarity in the june dfast results you mentioned the scb sort of be enough that you could reconsider this pace over the medium term jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah erika thats a good question and i understand what youre asking why youre asking it i think the answer is going to be a little bit unsatisfying which is that this is classic decisionmaking under uncertainty and its kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors but all the ingredients that youve listed are the right jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 ingredients right very strong organic capital generation uncertainty about the finalization of the rule uncertainty about the scb requirements and obviously our normal capital hierarchy which is that buybacks are always at the bottom of the hierarchy after were done using the capital for our other priorities so i think what i said previously stands which is that were sticking with the modest pace for now but obviously we have a lot of flexibility to adjust that whenever we want under the current regime and we may well do that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks and just as a followup the billion in expenses for does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co a little bit of that is in there yeah so you would see that we often talk about the volume in revenue related category and i think in my prepared remarks you will have noted that i talked about a billion increase in that category yearonyear as a result of an improved nir outlook so the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator next well go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi so youre guiding to billion of expenses thats up billion yearoveryear seems like quite a big increase and if you could just give some color on that i know weve been through this before two years ago with the big increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility so if you could just upfront give us visibility how much of that is due to incentive pay how much is that due to tech how much is that due to ai and what are the expected returns to get from that billion pickup thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mike thanks for the question and yeah and of course you will as i noted be hearing more from us at investor day and between now and investor day but i will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question because youre right its important to give you the transparency and im going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business so starting with ccb its the biggest dollar driver overall its an increase yearonyear which is about the same as we had last year one key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that in we built new branches and were planning about a similar number this year marketing is also a driver were seeing great opportunities great demand and engagement in our card products and so that shows up in marketing and as you well know our wealth strategy in ccb remains a big focus and priority jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 i think its worth noting here right that as weve talked about and as you know mike some of our investments are designed to produce shortterm payoffs and some of them are much longerterm and some of them are just table stakes but we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the ccb investment so for example in we had million net new checking accounts we had an growth in active card accounts and over the last three years weve increased deposit market share by basis points so as weve often said about the company as a whole were very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investing for the future in awm continued client advisor hiring is a key driver as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the support that they need and a little bit to the prior question in awm we also have a little bit of volume and revenuerelated driver tied to an improved revenue outlook the commercial bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem as well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and preexisting innovation economy strategy so we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise and then as you look into its really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally the cib story is a little bit different the percentage growth there is lower which recognizes i think both our very very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that weve been investing quite aggressively for some time in the payments business which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains so as a result the biggest driver in the cib is really generic inflation including labor as well as again to the prior question volume and revenuerelated increases tied to the improved nir outlook and i do want to say for the avoidance of doubt that despite all of this our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and making sure that were upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the cib remains fully in effect finally youll note that i havent actually talked about technology in any of the businesses and thats actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm even though its very bottomsup driven and those drivers are consistent with what theyve been new products features and customer platforms as well as modernization so thats happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise and i will say actually in closing talking about technology which i think is interesting that to the point about a driver being growth writ large one of the things that we see is higher volumerelated technology expense throughout the company so thanks for the question mike it was a good opportunity to give you guys a bit more color here mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i have a short followup im still here jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah can you just talk about the impact of ai on your technology approach and i know ive asked you this before and you said youre spending it youre being careful you want to see a return on your dollars but how much difference can this make how big is your tech budget last year how much should it be this year how much could ai make a difference just a little more meat on the tech bones jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so let me address the ai point and i think maybe i wont go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and ill save that for investor day if you dont mind but i will address the ai point so as you may be aware we actually have teresa heitsenrether now running the ai strategy for the company as a member of the operating committee which i think is an indication of the priority that we place on this and in partnership with lori and all of the technology organization so i think that i think of this as being a little bit barbelled where on the one hand were very excited about this theres clearly some very significant opportunities not for nothing starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for significantly increased productivity there at the same time were jpmorgan chase were not going to be chasing shiny objects here in ai we want to do this in an extremely disciplined way its very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes and so the current focus is on making sure we have a contained wellchosen list of highimpact use cases and that were throwing resources at those in the right way thats extremely pragmatic and disciplined and were holding ourselves accountable for actual results mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks mike operator next well go to the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets you may proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jeremy how are you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 jeremy coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six fed fund rate cuts that you guys are assuming can you give us a little insight why youre assuming six cuts is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are weaker or is it your just economic outlook the forward curve can you give us something behind why youre assuming so many rate cuts jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah gerard i wish the answer were more interesting but its just our practice we just always use the forward curve for our outlook and thats whats in there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good and then as a followup obviously you pointed out also in the outlook youre going to have some deposit attrition you had some of course in can you guys give us some insights on the impact qt is having on the deposit base for your organization and second are you surprised that qt hasnt been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question gerard i mean i think youve heard jamie talk about this a lot qt is obviously a big focus and one of the complicating elements that we have in the current environment i think that the math is the math in the sense that qt all else equal is withdrawing from systemwide deposits in the last six months of this year thats been offset hopefully by a reduction in the size of rrp and so thats been supportive of systemwide deposits as we go into rrp is at lower levels and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind but its also the case as you know that theres the markets expectation is that qt is going to start slowing down at some point this year so and we still have reasonable levels of reserves and some cushion from rrp so thats part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down with the shrinkage in systemwide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share but also i think the second half of this year is going to be interesting to watch in terms of what the fed does gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks gerard operator next well go to the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley you may proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions there has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound you noted youre starting the year with a healthy pipeline could you give us some more color on what youre jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 seeing there and how the rate in how the change in the rate environment is changing the conversations that youre having across ma ecm and dcm jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so as you know all else equal this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets so if you go into the details a little bit if you start with ecm that helps higher and well the recent rally in the equity markets helps i think thereve been some modest challenges with the ipo vintage in terms of postlaunch performance or whatever so thats a little bit of a headwind at the margin in terms of converting the pipeline but im not too concerned about that in general so i would expect to see rebound there in dcm again all else equal lower rates are clearly supportive one of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute level of rates and the rate of change that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates and therefore waiting to refinance in the hope of even lower rates so that can go both ways and then ma is a slightly different dynamic i think theres a couple nuances there one as you obviously know announced volume was lower this year so that will be a headwind in reported revenues in all else equal and of course we are in an environment of ma regulatory headwinds as has been heavily discussed but having said that i think were seeing a bit of pickup in deal flow and i would expect the environment to be a bit more supportive manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and on the flip side in ci you spoke about lower revolver utilization more muted demand what would it take for that to rebound do you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow even further if the capital markets open up even more jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a good question i mean i think as you say its a little bit of a i mean i wouldnt necessarily say that like lack of debt market access in the last year that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization i think the main driver there is just a little bit of residual anxiety in the csuite which increases as the companies get smaller in size so its really going to be a function of how plays out the softer the landing is the more supported the utilization should be i would think if things turn out a little bit worse i think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about capex and so on and so you might see utilization even lower manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator next well go to the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi you may proceed jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so i want to get your perspective on private credit overall the industry saw a lot of growth but its only so big relative to the banking market i think theres been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending but now youre starting to see more in assetbacked finance and youre seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy so my question to you is how big of a trend is this how much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular and most importantly how does jpmorgan adapt and participate jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks glenn so i think the last part of your question as you say is the most important part which is this as an important factor in the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company so it is a meaningful shift in the environment and something that weve been watching for some time weve made some enhancements and some new initiatives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated lending businesses but also go headtohead with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures if and when thats what the client actually wants it tends to be a tradeoff between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution and we can provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong longtime dcm franchise so thats been a priority and were actually already starting to see some results from that across both the commercial bank and the cib with certain client segments and in the bigger picture of course in the context of the basel iii endgame people talk a lot about the risk of certain lending activity getting pushed out of the regulated perimeter its important to be clear right these are important clients of ours too we compete with them theyre also clients and in the end our point here is just people and regulators in particular should just be aware of the likely consequences of whats happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that were looking around the corner a little bit glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi anything specific on assetbacked its an important part of your business too do you see it following the same path as direct lending has jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co its interesting i havent heard much about that glenn so we can look into it for you but to be honest the fact that i havent heard much makes me think that its maybe not such a big driver right now glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay cool thank you for that operator and for our final question well go to the line of charles peabody from portales partners you may proceed charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 thank you i have a question about the role that first republic plays in your nii forecast im assuming because youll have a full year in of first republic that their contribution of nii will be up lets say from billion this year to billion to billion next year but given that youre forecasting six rate cuts is that a detractor to your assumptions of nii from first republic or i mean you have that fdic note and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that i assume are repricing upwards so if youre talking about rate cuts that would hurt your nii forecast from first republic im guessing but if rates stay higher for longer wouldnt first republic be a much bigger contributor so talk about the sensitivities of first republic there jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks charlie so one thing that we said when we kind of gave first republic guidance at investor day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that and weve been splitting out first republic in our reported results in order to improve periodonperiod comparability we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on first republic and so we really focused on having our guidance be firmwide including first republic now that everything is embedded in the franchise having said that let me just react to a couple of the things that you said so again i dont want to get into like microvalidation one way or the other of some of your backoftheenvelope math but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year so i think the annualization that youre doing is maybe a bit high for the number and then from a sensitivities perspective i actually think i can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the ear per my response to the prior question because that ear fully includes all of the first republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics and so i think thats kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut just to make sure i understood what youre saying so you have nii ex markets going from billion to billion within that would the contribution from first republic be down as well or up james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its going to hit match the day we did it so jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i can probably answer that question if i think about it for a second but it sort of violates my prior statement that i really dont want to get into the business of guiding on first republic if i do the big picture right so big picture we had eight months of first republic nii were going to have so all else equal theres calendarization in there whats also true is that in as a result of the impact of the nii of the pull to par of certain relatively shortdated assets that we fairvalued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction that sort of that pull to par happens quite quickly and therefore probably juiced the number a little bit so therefore straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it then you just get into the questions about the ftp and the funding and whatever and then this is like too complicated so id rather not go there charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 all right thank you
