with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year our return on average assets and average common equity in the third quarter were and respectively and that compares with a and for the same period last year average deposits in the third quarter were billion down just basis points from billion in the third quarter of last year average loans grew by to billion in the third quarter compared with billion in the third quarter of last year we continue to see solid results resulting from the hard work of our frost bankers and the extension of our organic growth strategy as was the case in previous quarters cullenfrost didnt utilize any fhlb advances brokered deposits or reciprocal deposit arrangements to build insured deposit percentages or to fund liquidity so again as you look at our balance sheet what you see is what you get we continue to see excellent results in our organic growth program for our houston expansion on a combined basis what we call houston and houston we stand at of our deposit goal of our loan goal and of our new household goal for the dallas market expansion we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal we have the first three of our new austin expansion project open for three locations with three more planned to open before the end of this year and early results there continue to be very encouraging and in line with the other expansion markets at the end of the third quarter our overall expansion efforts continue to grow and had generated billion in deposits billion in loans and added more than new households as weve mentioned the success of the earlier expansion projects are funding the current expansion and we expect the overall expansion project will be accretive to earnings beginning in in our consumer business we had our best quarter of the year in customer growth adding over net new checking households we believe checking household growth remains industry leading at yearoveryear in an extremely competitive deposit environment that growth has been achieved without the use of direct cash incentive programs and used by many of our competitors our focus instead has been on top quality service great technology and a convenient expanding network of locations consumer deposits overall continue to recover and finished the quarter with a yearoveryear increase or million finally in area of consumer average consumer loans grew million or yearoveryear making this the ninth consecutive quarter with an annual growth rate of over this exceptional loan growth comes primarily from our secondlien home equity and home improvement products as well as our new mortgage product the investments weve made in organic expansion new products marketing technology and our employees are helping drive this outstanding growth across our consumer business we funded million in mortgage loans in the third quarter and at quarterend our total mortgage portfolio stood at million looking at our commercial cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 business average loan balances in the third quarter increased versus the same quarter last year cre balances grew by energy balances grew by and ci balances increased by our growth in new commercial relationships in the third quarter was strong increasing over the same quarter last year new loan commitments totaled billion in the third quarter that was up from the third quarter of last year the increase came from a increase in both cre and ci loans and a increase in energy albeit on a much smaller base we saw some improvement in credit quality during the third quarter in terms of problem loan resolutions total problem loans which we define as risk rated or higher totaled million at the end of the third quarter down from the million at the end for the second quarter credit quality is good by historical standards with net chargeoffs and nonaccrual loans both at healthy levels net chargeoffs for the third quarter were million compared to million last quarter and million a year ago annualized net chargeoffs for the third quarter represent basis points of period end loans nonperforming assets totaled million at the end of the third quarter and that compared with million last quarter and million a year ago and the quarterend figure increase got us to basis points of periodend loans and basis points of total assets and the increase was primarily due to million dollar credit moving to nonaccrual which is previously identified on our problem loan list about of our problem loans overall are tied to investor commercial real estate slightly less than are related to ci credits and most of the balance is in owner occupied real estate which is closely related to ci loans regarding commercial real estate lending our overall portfolio remains stable with steady operating performance across all asset types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values at levels similar to what weve reported in prior quarters investor cre loans totaled billion or of total cre loans outstanding and the investor cre portfolio exhibited an overall average loan to value at underwriting of about and our average weighted debt service at that time of i continue to be encouraged by our outlook and the consistent success of our strategy for organic growth and what i believe are the best banking markets in the us and with that ill turn it over to dan dan geddes incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil i would like to first thank jerry for being gracious with his time during the transition process i wish him the best in this next chapter and will enjoy these next two months working with him until his retirement at yearend he has truly set a high bar in this role for me to strive for regarding net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter the increase was primarily driven by both higher volumes and yields on loans looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the third quarter up million from the second quarter primarily due to an increase in fair value of our available for sale portfolio during the third quarter investment purchases totaled just million with million of the total being municipals with a taxable equivalent yield of the net unrealized loss on available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion a decrease of million from the billion reported at the end of the second quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 total investment portfolio in the third quarter was up basis points from the second quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion up approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged billion during the third quarter flat with the second quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter at the end of the third quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was years down from years in the second quarter looking at funding sources on a linked quarter basis average total deposits of billion were up million or from the previous quarter average noninterest bearing demand deposits were essentially flat with the second quarter down million while interest bearing deposits increased million or when compared to the previous quarter based on third quarter average balances noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were compared to in the second quarter the cost of interest bearing deposits in the third quarter was up basis points from in the second quarter while rates on interest bearing deposits decreased slightly compared to the second quarter we saw a continued mix shift into higher yielding depository accounts primarily cds being the primary driver of the basis point increase thus far in october month todate average deposits are up about million above the third quarter average a positive trend to start the fourth quarter with that split about onethird in noninterest bearing deposits and two thirds being interest bearing deposits customer repos for the third quarter averaged billion basically flat with the second quarter the cost of customer repos for the quarter was down basis points from the second quarter the monthtodate october average balance for customer repos as of october was essentially flat with the third quarter average next looking at net noninterest income and expense on a linked quarter basis ill point out a couple items regarding noninterest income service charges on deposits were up about million or unannualized driven primarily by our organic growth of consumer and commercial accounts in terms of noninterest expense salaries and wages expense was up million or impacted primarily by higher head count and incentive accruals looking at capital during the third quarter we did buy back million of our stock for the year we now have purchased approximately  at an average price of ill now turn the call over to jerry for commentary on our full year guidance jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you dan and thank you for those nice words regarding our guidance for full year our current projections include two basis point cuts for the fed funds rate over the remainder of with a cut in november and december for net interest income we continue to expect net interest income growth for the full year in the range of to looking at loans on a yeartodate average basis loans are up compared to last yeartodate we expect full year average loan growth in the low double digits slightly better than our previous guidance of high single digits to low double digits growth looking at deposits the current yeartodate average is down compared cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 to last yeartodate we expect full year average deposits to be down between and that represents a decrease from our previous guidance of flat to down based on yeartodate growth and current projections we are projecting growth in noninterest income in the range of to up from our previous guidance of growth of to based on our yeartodate results and current projections we are projecting full year noninterest expense growth in the range of to on a reported basis that is down from the to previous guidance regarding net chargeoffs on a yeartodate basis it represent an annualized basis points of average loans we expect the full year to be in the range of basis points to basis points of average loans that is down from our previous guidance of basis points to basis points of average loans and regarding taxes our effective tax rate for the yeartodate of was and we currently expect the full year to come in at that level or slightly lower thats in line with previous guidance with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well thank you well open it up for questions now question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions one moment while we poll for questions our first question is from peter winter with da davidson please proceed peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thanks i was wondering could you just talk about maybe the trajectory of the margins as the fed forward curve is suggesting additional rate cuts and i would assume less rate cuts andor more gradual rate cuts and a steeper yield curve is kind of an ideal environment for you dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah peter thank you i think youre right that look what were seeing is some push and pulls here is we feel like theres going to be opportunity to reprice our investment portfolio and our fixed rate portfolio the unknown is going to be as rates go down what will deposits do and were hopeful well see continued growth in deposits and so we think theres some opportunity there but with such a we do have a asset sensitive balance sheet so as rates go down we will see that lowering of our yield on our floating rate portfolio and our book were holding at the fed so yeah i mean i think you can see really for the fourth quarter i think you can see just probably some steadiness to i dont see it moving around much that fourth quarter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co and do you think im not asking for specific guidance but can you see that even with the fed cutting rates into next year that the margin could increase just with the repricing benefit on the earning assets and ability to lower deposit cost cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think there is that opportunity because we do have quite a bit of our securities portfolio maturing or repaying into next year and we have about billion of our fixed rate loan portfolio in terms of expected payoffs in terms of amortizations and maturities so there will be opportunities if you look at if you do look at our kind of back book of both our investment portfolio and our fixed rate portfolio were going to be able to pick up some yield there peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it and just one more question just on loan growth so the loan growth has been better than peers youve moved the guidance to the upper end of the range obviously the branch expansion build out new client growth is contributing do you think that theres this pentup loan demand also as we get past the election and rates move lower that it could lead to even stronger loan growth next year phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know peter i honestly think there is some pentup demand as weve canvassed our people as we do every quarter because ive visited branches and talked to our relationship managers as i do every year looked at every location i think thats the most consistent theme that i have heard is there is a hesitancy for people to move forward on some fronts not on every front but theres its the single most repeated area of why are we seeing things maybe be a little bit slower why might somebody be hesitating i think its definitely the election and you know i think regardless of which way it goes i think the fact that its over will just clear up uncertainty and people will be moving forward but as i looked at the current quarter i looked at new commitments were up from last year about that was about but they were down a little bit from second quarter and now second quarter was really strong but looked at new relationships is up that was a little flattish compared to the previous quarter the pipeline for days was in my view a little flattish compared to the previous quarter and even new opportunities were a little flattish and then another thing that we saw was that if you look at advances under revolving lines of credit they went from like i think the last quarter to so its just this sort of eerie pause i think i think once we get past the election that youre going to see underlying fundamentals continue to kick in and as i read comments from people who talk to customers and these were notes about them pretty much in all the cases when they said well things are slowing because of the election it was like well they expect that once we got past that they would return to a good level so i think youre right there is some pentup demand i cant tell you how much but i just think its absorbing way too much of our indiscernible bandwidth right now peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks phil that was very helpful i appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well thanks cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc appreciated the update on the outlook i was wondering for the nii guide what are you seeing in terms of your early experience on the down rate deposit beta following the september cut and can you just remind us what your expectation is on that front as we go through the cycle dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure so our nii overall expectation is we were one of the first to go up when the rates went up and so were going to be mindful of competition but our expectations is that youll see a similar beta going down right now the beta going up is around basis points and i think youd expect to see it on the way down but it may take a little bit of time to work through just because our mix this time around has a little bit more cds and those the of our cds are in days so its just going to take a quarter for that to work its way through to the lower yielding cd rates so i think you can expect it to be similar but its just due to the mix of our interest bearing deposits david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that makes sense and then just given your comments about the nim for next year if youre thinking about maybe the potential for nim stability or expansion next year with cuts i would think that would be some decent nii growth with growth in the balance sheet is that how youre seeing it dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc were not going to give guidance until next quarter thats a tradition that tradition that jerrys held and so well maintain that you know i will just kind of give you just a little bit of for the remainder of this year we do have million of our investment portfolio expected to either mature or with prepay and those are yielding right now so thats an opportunity whether that we will use that to stay at the fed or go into our loan portfolio well just have to see again i mentioned about billion in those are yielding million approximately so maybe not as much of a pickup in david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then just switching to expenses you mentioned you tighten that expense guide to the to range which is a bit better as you look out into the fourth quarter and just youve given some preliminary thoughts on how you thought about next year is there any reason why that growth rate would accelerate and do cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 you see any opportunities for that growth to actually decelerate into next year just given your plans on the expansion strategy thanks dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i dont see it decelerating but what i would say is again were not going to give guidance for next year but were going to continue to invest in our people our technology and with the customer experience so i think thats how i would answer that question i dont know if anyone phil any comments there phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc our expansion is still going to be strong were going to finish up dallas got to lean hard into austin next year so youll have that technology is an area that everyone is seeing increases in i dont think we are going to see a lot of back off from that and were growing were in great markets so were going to be continuing to lean into that as we said over the years and as you followed us were pretty tight on expenses i mean youve got to the three people in this room weve got to sign off on something before you hire anybody or have much of a capital expenditure so were pretty requiring but we also know that were investing right now its paying off i think our or this organic growth that weve had is just remarkable and nows not the time for us to do that but same time were mindful of what we spend on and were trying to be as careful as we can but i think right now im not expecting that were going to be slowing down in terms of our investment into our business with expenses but i promise you were not being lazy with it and were not being were not going overboard with anything its just stuff that we think works for us and has a really important reason david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah appreciate that maybe one last one on credit you mentioned the big improvement in problem loans this quarter i was just wondering what the driver was for the bump up in the reserve ratio given that if those were just specific reserves on npas and you talked about the growth you had there or did something in the economic outlook worsen a bit for you dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc it wasnt an economic outlook it was primarily that one loan that phil had mentioned drove that and just our we did have strong loan growth david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah got it thanks guys and jerry good luck for retirement jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you dave appreciate it operator our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i wanted to follow up phil i think in your opening remarks you talked about deposit growth and that was coming without having to do promotional strategies and pay upfront marketing dollars to bring in deposits just if you dont mind spend some time in terms of what are the big avenues in terms of deposit acquisition today is this tied to lending or just pure checking account opening means im assuming its a function of the branches and the investments you made but give us a sense of whats driving the client acquisition thats translating into deposit core deposit growth phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well ebrahim i think its a lot of things weve mentioned i think i mentioned in my comments that first of all the expansion is making a big difference for us if you just look at deposit growth i think of the percentage growth we had i think of that growth was for expansion and if you look at lets look at client acquisition in the channels were still were now were of our client acquisition of those household acquisitions is coming through the physical plant come into the physical locations as opposed to online weve still got great online throughput for new customers so the expansion is very solid and thats no doubt about it that thats helping with this outsized growth rate the other thing though is our customer services is world class i mean it just is and so word of mouth is a big reason driving growth as we look at the factors we rank order gosh i think its at least factors for why customers have come to us and we will do our best to get that information as they sign up interestingly this is on the consumer side the number one factor still is convenient location but the second factor is our call is for fairly soon after fairly close to that is a recommendation from somebodys family or friends and that speaks to the customer service focus that weve got and ill add two other things to that our app last time i looked was the highest rated financial app in the app store for apple and so youve got to have great technology and one thing that we did i think you might remember us talking about the last few years is we really hadnt leaned hard into the marketing dollars wed done pretty much everything else but marketing was an area that we really needed to build our infrastructure and our expertise really and weve made a lot of investment in that to support some of this expense growth you see and i think weve gotten better and better at targeting customers at the right time and thats really helping our growth so its not any one thing it really is all those things together and then ill also say that you were in great markets and we picked best submarkets we can come up with in these like houston and dallas and austin these are really growing markets and so its just its hitting on all cylinders and i think were getting better at it as we continue to learn from our previous expansion efforts and so im really optimistic for it its not any one thing its just discipline hard work and our people are doing a great job cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess phil on the lending side give us i mean its been a good year in terms of loan growth it sounds like youre relatively upbeat even as we come out of i guess elections next week but give us a sense of the competitive landscape some of the regional banks have had a time to repair their balance sheets great markets but intense competition i believe so what are you seeing from the regional banks or the big banks in terms of just the nature of competition and in any of your lending are you coming across direct lenders private credit that one prevalent three four five years ago and youve gotten your bankers are now having to compete against phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i would say the competition is heating up were seeing more proposals on deals i think that and just look at cre i think youve got more players there some of the structures that were seeing are theyre just theres not ones that will do i mean its the same old stuff right weve seen this movie so many times before but its not as bad as it was i would say precovid but its loosening up and there are more players that are willing to pay and play now i think a year ago or two there was a lot of people who were kind of running out of money and were on the sidelines for some of these deals particularly commercial real estate and so now as you see quality deals in particular you see some structures that we just dont think makes sense as far as other players we are seeing private equity be a part of the market i would say the places that i see it anecdotally are more people considering it on the lets say a multifamily loan its coming up to maturity its not at stabilization yet in terms of its occupancy numbers so it really cant do permanent financing it really cant sell very efficiently so but its all you got to do is get to that point and people are releasing its just taking longer and so private equity might be a good solution for that person to get to that point and once they get there theres a lot of liquidity available for these stabilized projects so im seeing that a little bit and i guess thats sort of the lay of the land i dont think that on the consumer side i dont think competition there is kind of out of whack i mean weve got great growth indiscernible when i say weve grown in any one category for nine consecutive quarters it otherwise would make me nervous but thats just a product whose time is its the right place at the right time youve got people who will not give up the or mortgages and if theyre going to get access capital in their house or expand their house theyre going to do it through a home equity or a home improvement or something like that so and like i said i think i said in my comments if i didnt continue to that our average credit scores theyre like a so credit is still good and thats just happens to be the right place at the right time for that product and then mortgages its new but its being successful and its were only just around million now but its going to continue to grow and so thatll be good i hope that help and the general comments on the market ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc appreciate the color thanks phil and good luck jerry jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 thank you ebrahim operator our next question is from catherine mealor with kbw please proceed catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted just to first circle back on expenses i know that the fourth quarter typically has some higher expenses just related to the restricted stock awards just wondering if you could remind us on typically the what that looks like and so maybe what a better kind of run rate is to go into as we start next years growth rate jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i guess i would answer just start that and let dan add any color i would almost send you back to the trend in last years third to fourth quarter i kind of look at that i think that gives you some good perspective as you noted in your comments we do have some awards that by their nature get expensed immediately so i think if you look at that that kind of give you a feel for kind of what those sort of that things do to our expense run rate dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and i i dont have anything else to add i think thats a youve nailed it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc okay catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe one other followup on the margin just the securities maturities you talked about youve got billion in fixed rate loan repricing and amortization on the securities piece remind us your annual maturities that we should see next year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 sure and let me just go to that but it was around billion next year catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and again that had a yield phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc some mid phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc mid yeah catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc mid okay and then you mentioned that your purchases slowed little bit this quarter would it be your intention to see that kind of similar pace over the next couple of quarters or how are you thinking about the balance of maybe the size of the bond book phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think its just going to depend you know what weve been doing is just building optionality into the to the balance sheet really for the last few quarters i think its paid off for us i mean we i dont think anyone knows exactly how things are going to go its kind of like my customers now lets get past the election lets see how the markets respond and i think that well have some optionality and decide where the value is in the market and we might decide to begin utilizing some of that catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that makes sense i think were all excited to get past next week and then maybe one last one just on fees fees were really strong this quarter and your guide moved up a little bit can you just give us some color on what youre seeing there and then i know youre not giving guidance for next year but it feels like theres probably some fee momentum just given in your expansion markets and just any kind of discussion around opportunities youre seeing there that may improve as we move into and dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know i think its really driven by our organic growth so i think youre seeing that our fee growth is really a function of volume looking into next year there could be interchange regulation that comes that comes down that could be a factor to the downside so just something to keep in mind that we will as well but again i think its primarily a volume for the fourth quarter and just to give you clarity into that yield it was around cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great so the billion next year dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc point catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc assuming at okay great very helpful thank you great quarter phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from ben gerlinger with citi please proceed benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i know youre not giving guidance for but when you think of just kind of the bigger picture here of the investment spend i know you have done houston houston dallas and austin youre also focusing on technology i think earlier in this year maybe it was late last year you said kind of the 5ish is kind of table stakes for not only the texas franchise but when one that kind of leads into innovation but when you think about the i hate to say noncore because expansion is core but when you think about after austin is there more branch build out penciled in or just kind of thinking for a longer term strategy kind of answer phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that this is a this kind of expansion ill put it that way is going to be a part of our strategy and i call this strategy its scalable and its durable and what i see as we finish up dallas and we finish up austin and youre probably looking at you look just say months for that i mean just think about it i think well what well be doing is doubling down back into these markets that weve made these investments i mean i think about it sometimes lets go a couple of years forward finishing up dallas we finishing up austin by that time the houston expansion the original will be eight years old in terms of when we first began doing that cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 well houstons grown a ton in the last eight years and you can say the same thing about whats been going on in dallas et cetera so what i think well be doing is well be continuing to expand in those great markets particularly dallas and houston and but were going to be able instead of filling in large chunks of the market where we just werent present i think its allowing us to go where the puck is going and go to those areas where growth has been and lets take houston over that eight year period but also go where the growth is currently going it allow us to be in some of these markets these location markets earlier and i think thatll be helpful to us so i see us continuing to do that for the foreseeable future and i really expect us to be doing in these major markets in texas benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats very helpful i mean with texas being the backdrop of inmigration of both people and companies is it when you think about just kind of loan growth across in the united states texas is obviously doing better on average so if loan growth starts to accelerate do you think pricing competition gets a little bit even more competitive within texas because it already has the growth in people want to double down there im thinking just more of a from a competitive standpoint and following up on ebrahims question but if loan growth accelerates from here does pricing competition get even more intensified phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i do think that as markets heat up yeah i think itll get worse around the margins but weve dealt with that man for so long i mean and through these cycles and new competitors coming in that i really dont see it really impeding anything that that were doing we are one of the things that with regard to price competition i mean if you look at our balance sheet and our cost of deposits id really argue that were one of the low cost producers on input as it relates to funding so were able to compete on price very effectively the thing that we dont like to compete on and were willing to lose deals on and i guess two thirds to three quarters deals we lose is structure that we like to get paid back right and so thats where you will probably see it heat up most and thats probably where it will affect us most is because we wont there are certain kind of deals that we just wont do and there are certain people for whatever reason that will do certain deals certain way and weve learned over the years theres no money in that long term benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yes all right thats helpful appreciate it thank you operator our next question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good afternoon indiscernible cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry if i missed this but i thought i heard the opportunity for securities repricing for this year and next year the billion of loans this year but can you talk about what the repricing opportunity is for fixed rate loans next year and what rate loans are rolling off at and what rates loans are coming on at right now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure its again i think our back book is around and so were able to reprice those fixed rate loans at around and so its around million for the fourth quarter and then billion in the so just to make sure i was clear on that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it sorry i missed that and then weve had some banks talk about capital markets opening up and some paydowns coming through on the cre side is that something that youre seeing in your book too i know the belly of the curve is back up but did you see any elevated paydowns while rates were lower phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well with regards to cre i mean as long as the project is stabilized and on the occupancy side yeah theres a lot of money available and weve seen really strong cap rates and mainly talking about multifamily right now but some really really strong cap rates i talked about one last quarter that was a big success for the developer builder weve seen sub long term rates available in the market so theres capital available once a project reach stabilization thats really a challenge when you do see challenges thats the challenge that youve got is lease up has been slower because just im again im talking multifamily mainly because supply has been so strong but people are taking these units down its youre just seeing in some cases less rent growth than you underwrote youre seeing more concessions that kind of thing but you are getting projects leased up and once y you get there theres were seeing that theres capital available dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and i think thats where private credit has a place its kind of serving as ill call it kind of a bridge if a project needs months and so its a higher priced higher yielding maybe less structure but its serving its purpose of providing capital in the market manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so it sounds like youre able to get much stronger loan growth despite some of those factors weighing on overall loan growth in the balance sheet so is the velocity of loans up a little bit more than before now phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 no i mean theres a lot of things at work okay so we did a great job building our cre portfolio with great sponsors and great projects over the last three years theyve been performing well theyve been funding up because were probably the last in the capital stack and so those a number of those projects are still being built so youve got some of that and thats true in multifamily limited amount and office and industrial that kind of thing retail have been one of it so i think thats one thing thats happening as i said our consumer growth has been really strong itll be interesting to see what happens going forward i mean the ci piece i think has been a little weaker the last eight weeks maybe and i think i really believe it has a fair amount to do with the election and the uncertainty there i think that will clear up i hope to see that continue to grow i think commercial real estate balances will have some pressure just because were going to be paying down refinancing and some of these projects are going to be sold and we havent built up a lot of pipeline for some of the projects like multifamily for example i dont think weve done maybe one over the last year so therell be a little pressure there as those things fund up and then pay off but weve had other successes in that that are still under construction still be funding up so its going to be interesting to see but i think overall our outlook postelection is pretty positive dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and just to support that i think our ability to bring in new relationships sets us apart and of our yeartodate increase in loan balance is coming from new customers that weve acquired in the last months and i think thats an important differentiator that were able to to with this organic growth strategy to grow specifically in the in our loan portfolio manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc well thank you thats very helpful and jerry all the very best jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our final question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah congrats jerry jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes you flagged the seasonal deposit change in the fourth quarter and dan you gave us some of the numbers but whats the typical seasonal deposit change and it feels like the mix is similar to what you have on the balance sheet right now in terms of noninterest bearing and interest bearing is that right dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes yeah what were seeing is similar jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah historically i guess we probably had bigger increases in the noninterest bearing just because weve got some of the larger customers trying to strengthen their balance sheet but id say that theres almost nothing that i would say at this point theres really been consistent theres been so much movement and with rates going down we think there will be were thinking that deposit growth will be even better i think well be able to compete more against the money market funds given the fact that some of them will have betas but i think from a seasonal standpoint as dan quoted we are moving in that direction so we still feel very strongly that the trend will continue theres just some uncertainty about how much of it really will happen but were feeling good about it at this point jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and the interest bearing costs are going down the next incremental dollar and interest bearing is generally down dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah any changes to how you guys manage the balance sheet in terms of more active hedging if the fed assuming the fed continues to cut rates cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2024 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc not really i mean weve got so much cash i think the most efficient thing for us has been use cash markets when we have conviction i think that there have been a lot of people who a lot of companies who didnt have a that kind of liquidity so the most efficient thing for them is to use noncash markets but i think theres a premium that theyre paying so it doesnt make sense for us to pay the premium that others have to when weve got the liquidity when we get conviction on it but no we really havent seen that theres value i mean they look at it all the time but we really havent seen that theres value right in those positions as opposed to using cash mortgage jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then on service charge revenue do you feel like that growth rate is accelerating it just i know you called out a few things in the quarter but are the new branches starting to generate fee income and is that accelerating or am i reading too much into them dan geddes a incoming chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i dont i think it is a driver of just us bringing on new customers and so our growth in number of customers is driving that fee income growth will we so we should see as grow into dallas and into austin again just our ability to grow customers will help that whether thats at a nonannualized pace that may be high jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right okay thank you appreciate it operator with no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference
