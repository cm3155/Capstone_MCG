contain forwardlooking statements actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our sec filings including the risk factors in our s that we expanded a little more in cmos in commercial mbs all government guaranteed because part of what were doing is trying to put on some cleaner duration paper as opposed to take up premium at risk and weve also continued to hunt in the specified pools and just the current coupon so thats been some of the rotations there and then weve supplemented that with a little bit of expansion in the international areas around some foreign sovereigns and then some of the aaa agencies have also been an area of expansion vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you eric state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess one easy question one tougher question but first so end of period loans were up is that right i mean why is that what seems to be a little different eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp mike end of period loans were up well they were up slightly we like lending to be up in this environment given that were there for our clients you had two offsetting factors you had number one the continued growth in our client lending capital call financing in particular continues to be a real important part of our growth to the alts managers and that was just offset by some amount of reduction in the overdraft balances on an end of period basis but the net was up slightly and i think more indicative is total loans were up about or yearover year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and have you said anything about cutting cost in how should we think about cost next year eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp i guess you continue to ask the easy questions so weve not given outright guidance for next year mike yet well do that in january but weve been clear that we reduced cost this year last year adjusted for the acquisition we were down and we continue to like the approach given the economic environment to drive cost down and we think thats appropriate so those are in our plans and what were working through is whats the magnitude of that next year because what we do need to do is continue drive for gross cost savings but we also need to reinvest in our business and especially as we add new business and you saw some of the wins this year were going to have to implement that some of that takes some funding and then we want to continue to invest and expand into products features and so forth of the platform and that fronttoback platform in particular which is going to take some resources but netnet we expect cost to continue to be down not only this year but also next year ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp what i would like to add to that is weve been very clear that this is not a one and done kind of thing i mean sure there are some tactical things that we that if theyre there and low hanging fruit you grab at it and you realize that but weve been were on a sustained program to transform our business much of it is around productivity improvement and much of that is driven by the ongoing automating of processes reduction of manual processes et cetera so this is i mean you should expect us to be thinking about this and implementing this on an ongoing basis mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and thats a good segue to my harder question which is maybe a big phrase like a jeopardy question so the answer i think and correct me if im wrong what youre doing is youre improving efficiency productivity automation youre expanding your revenue streams as you said at the start ron and now youre expanding the total addressable market with more focus not just on the top but next and i guess the question is why and is part of the why because assets under custody were up yearoveryear and the servicing fees were only up in other words i dont see the revenues keeping up with the business volume and therefore you have to go to these alternative streams and i guess really the question is what are you seeing one pricing pressure you said it was easing you said some business has been coming on at a higher margin but were not seeing it in the final results that are released to us thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp mike let me start here i would add a fourth element to what were doing which is also basically expanding our addressable market meaning that moving from the typical traditional custodian role of being a fund servicer to also being an enterprise outsourcer and to work with the actual management companies or the plan sponsors on their own operating model and thats an incremental revenue stream that isnt available to us why are we doing it i mean its no secret that the traditional fund services business has its series of challenges not just price compression although notwithstanding that weve done a good job at it i mean just think about it go back years ago its all about new funds being created somebody will have a line of domestic funds then they might move into other asset classes they might move into new jurisdictions new countries now if anything youre seeing the number of funds go down as distribution platforms are saying one we dont want as many funds and two were more interested in smas anyway so its these trends that are underlying our strategic pivot here now as weve also said it takes a while for this revenue to be realized and youre kind of seeing that even in the way we started talking to you about this expanded pipeline at the beginning of now were talking to you about fronttoback alpha wins and so you should expect to see that some of the things that we talked about in the past in and early will start to be showing up in future quarters as alpha wins it just these things take longer because going back to what i said earlier were actually working with the management company on overhauling the way they work the way they invest the way they employ data the actual tools that theyre going to be using the actual tools theyre not going to be using so i hope thats the why in terms of what were doing here state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last followup just to size that so going from a custodian to an enterprise outsourcer at what point like what percentage of the firm or revenues would be enterprise outsourcing today where was it a few years ago where do you hope that to get to and when do i transfer my coverage to our firms fintech analyst because thats the direction i think youre going ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah i mean its a little early to talk about that and we will talk about our strategy more in some of the upcoming conferences and maybe well get into that we havent really thought about that but i think your i would agree with your point that you should expect to see it be a higher and higher percentage of what we do and youre also accurate about the technology content in here and this is very much a technology and a software driven strategy mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ron and good morning eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric can you share with us you mentioned about the cet1 ratio as your binding constraint and you said that its obviously too high at even too high above how well do you think you could comfortably bring that down to and then simultaneously whats your thoughts about redeeming more preferred stock in or eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp yeah gerard its eric maybe to tackle those in reverse order its a little early to think through the preferred question because we really want to see what happens with this next round of kind of intermediate ccar test and just see if theres anything different or not there so were keeping an eye on it we like the fact that weve already called a couple of preps wed certainly be happy to do more if we can so i think that one is certainly always in mind and well give that some more thought state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 i think on the broader topic of capital ratios were doing a lot of work here and maybe just to frame out clearly we have too much capital given the limitations and thats fine well get it back to shareholders as soon as we can the ratios that we need to do is we clearly need to run above the the scb requirement lets assume and we feel confident that that will stay and that scb obviously subject to the fed indications but the work were doing is how much cet1 capital volatility have for oci and thats where were kind of working through well how can we should we put in to held to maturity versus available for sale so we have some ability to influence that and then we have some amount of volatility to be honest in rwas right in riskweighted denominator just because you get volatility you get some a little bit of rwa expansion in the fx books so is that do you need volatility cushion of at least basis points probably we as bankers want to run conservatively so i think what were wrestling through is where in the range of is too high ive said is kind of one of those kind of areas that you want to think really seriously about crossing below because there is some volatility in our business and so somewhere in that range theres got to be somewhere that wed like to run and were doing a little work to finetune that but i think if you do the math that away youd get to a view that theres really a substantial amount of capital to release based on where were running because were running at and down to somewhere in the to range is a real return a sizable return for our shareholders gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc absolutely that would be very positive moving a little bit back into that investment securities portfolio clearly were all focused on the rate environment and i think everybody is on oneside of the boat so to speak in that the rate environment is going to stay low for an extended period of time but it also brings out the interest rate risk for a securities portfolio should rates go up surprisingly for and what indicators do you guys keep an eye on and you can name two or three that really would make you change the way you look at your investment security duration or where there could be a risk from a marktomarket situation if this got out of line and rates started to go up which nobody is really planning for the forward curve certainly doesnt call for that at the long end so im just curious how do you guys manage and keep an eye on this so that you dont get caught offside should something change unexpectedly to months from now eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp gerard i think there are a number of indicators but part of what we do is we manage for the concerning outcomes the downsides right so what were careful in the portfolio is you dont want to barb out between month paper and 30year paper because you get a bit move in rates the 30year hurts same thing with 3month paper and 10year paper so were quite careful about where we operate on the curve and its not just an average duration that we run at but we have a series of limits across the curve and well position to your point to be quite careful and circumspect so thats one theres kind of an outright management process in sort of places that well operate i think in terms of indications theres clearly a set of fed indications and then market indications the fed has been quite clear about their policy around lifting rates theyve been quite clear about how long theyve been quite clear about inflation targets and kind of general monetary policy planning and i think thats actually youve got a scribe a fair amount of reliability to that state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 and then there are all the market indicators whether its the front end of the curve the steepening the volatility inherent in some of the curve structures and other indicator that were very conscious of and then ive got to say theres no substitute for doing a running a battery of tests a battery of stress tests because youre always worried about what you dont know and what youre not seeing in the marketplaces and the good thing about rates markets is weve got 50yearsplus of solid history and well do all those tests and then well do the theoretical ones so anyway its something were very careful on i think is the bottom line gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate the color eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl from kbw your line is open brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks yeah mine is just a real quick question a clarification question so eric when you were talking about the nii of kind of the goforward pass the fourth quarter i think you said a couple percentage points down first quarter second quarter but did you mean a couple of percentage points down in the first quarter and then another couple of percentage points down in the second quarter and then stabilize from there thanks eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp good question brian i said a couple percentage points down either in first quarter or second quarter we think theres a small stepdown from to one or the other its just really hard because youre always working through what are the headwinds and tailwinds at an inflection point to call the trough but we think its sometime in the first half and we think its we think given what we know today and kind of the market indicators and the assumptions weve shared we think its one of those two quarters brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator thank you that was our last question i will now turn it over to ron ohanley ronald philip ohanley
