with that ill turn it over to jim james michael cracchiolo chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good morning and thank you for joining us i hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy clearly this has been an extraordinary and challenging period globally im proud of how well ameriprise has responded to this pandemic from the start our priority has been serving our clients as well as the health and safety of the ameriprise team we benefited from our substantial business continuity planning and investments and quickly shifted approximately of our employees advisors and field staff to working from home in midmarch weve been able to maintain very strong client and advisor engagement with very little disruption our technology capabilities have been outstanding our teams are working seamlessly and collaboratively in this virtual work environment were helping clients stay focused on their longterm goals and navigate tough markets the strength of our advice value proposition and the solutions we offer are ideally suited for this environment and were operating with an excellent financial foundation we maintain a large excess capital position substantial liquidity and a highquality investment portfolio were generating strong cash flow and were always very disciplined in terms of risk management and ongoing expense management during this crisis ameriprise is operating well and i believe we are in a strong position in terms of the markets and economic backdrop clearly there are headwinds the first two months were quite strong but with the declines in march equity markets ended the quarter down sequentially and year over year the fed has been aggressive including cutting shortterm interest rates by basis points to near zero we saw some improvement in the equity markets in april on optimism around reopening however were seeing the economic impacts of the shutdown and stayathome orders and we expect the environment to remain challenging with elevated volatility lets discuss the first quarter we started the quarter on a record pace and even with the market headwinds we delivered good results on an adjusted operating basis ex auto home and including the tax benefit we highlighted we delivered net revenue growth of earnings grew with eps up and roe exaoci was up from a year ago our assets under management and administration ended the quarter at billion down reflecting significant pointtopoint decline in equity markets however this was partially offset by strong client flows and if you look at our total margin it is in line with last year at and thats even after the impact of lower equity markets and the interest rate cut in march i want to turn to wealth management and what i believe will continue to differentiate us as we move through an economic recovery with the very real challenges clients are facing this is when our advisors and our business really stand out were helping keep clients on track and focused on their longterm goals the investments weve made over the last few years and those we accelerated in are paying good dividends in this environment our digital and cloud capabilities which include our crm platform ongoing goal tracking websites and mobile apps are all helping our advisors maintain their strong relationships with clients and stay productive ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 very clearly we delivered a good quarter in advice wealth management despite the significant dislocation in march we had strong revenue growth of good earnings growth and meaningful growth in net inflows into fee based accounts and strong activity levels on a relative basis we maintained very good margins in fact awm margin remained above like others shortterm interest rates will impact our profitability however continued strong client activity and engagement the strength of our advisor productivity and our banking operations which are beginning to ramp up nicely are positives for continuing to generate good margins as you can see in the quarter were managing expenses back to more normal levels at about a growth rate ex the bank this compares favorably to our revenue growth in awm and we will continue to tightly manage expenses and remain in line with the revenue environment we had very good growth in client and advisor metrics in awm it was one of our best quarters for total client net inflows and more than billion went into investment advisory accounts in the quarter a record we saw good pickup in transactional activity as more clients engaged with us in financial planning and advice relationships advisor productivity increased as advisors leveraged our capabilities client brokerage cash balance increased close to so more than billion as clients built up cash given market volatility growth in cash slowed in april and we would expect these assets to be put back to work in the future even with the market pullback client activity inflows in march were solid and that continued in april our advisors are working closely with clients to keep them focused help them adjust and look for opportunities on the recruiting front we attracted experienced highlyproductive advisors from across the industry in the quarter and the pipeline looks very good regarding the recruiting climate the covid19 crisis has created challenges but also opportunities we moved to virtual recruiting and have been able to recruit and onboard advisors successfully were pleased by the very high engagement from our advisors who are interested in ameriprise as in previous challenging environments our financial strength and comprehensive advisor value proposition makes us an attractive destination for experienced advisors there may certainly be a slowdown in recruiting in the near term but longer term we see an opportunity as some advisors consider making a change and seek a highquality firm with a track record of helping advisors grow and thrive again weve been able to operate very well during this period with all of the capabilities and support we put in place our advisors as well as new recruits have been impressed with how quickly and effectively ameriprise mobilized when the crisis broke and how well we have supported them and their clients we also continue to build and grow our bank in the quarter we brought more than billion of cash sweep balances on the balance sheet bringing the total to over billion we began to grow our card portfolio focusing on the ameriprise client base the test for our mortgage program went well and we are beginning to roll that out more broadly in the second quarter and were planning for pledge loans to be implemented in the latter part of the year in regard to our insurance and annuity solutions weve been very proactive ensuring we have the right focus in this climate were making the appropriate pricing and underwriting adjustments and were maintaining our strong risk management across these books the businesses are delivering solid earnings in line with our expectations for this low interest rate environment and theyre generating strong free cash flow in terms of annuities variable annuity cash sales were up from a year ago with a mix shift towards products without living benefit guarantees we launched a new structured solution annuity in january and were getting good uptake and will accelerate this shift even further in protection life sales continue to grow in our vul product as with variable annuities we have made pricing and benefit changes weve also made cap rate reductions and adjustments to our underwriting as appropriate so ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 overall the takeaway is that were being proactive and well continue to do so consistent with our risk management discipline moving to asset management we had a good quarter after a record start in january and february that built off of the progress weve made last year we were able to move to operate remotely on a global basis in a seamless way weve been very engaged with investors intermediary partners and institutional consultants reinforcing the strength of our key strategies and providing an informed perspective weve benefited from the investments weve been making to ensure our teams can communicate with the right advisors and support our distribution partners in terms of the quarter we delivered a increase in retail gross sales globally compared to a year ago which is very strong the strong sales momentum in retail led to being billion positive for the firm in january and february however flows turned negative in march due to a pickup in retail redemptions as clients derisked their portfolios institutional clients invested through the market dislocation and we saw nice additions to existing client mandates and we had some wins that funded leading to net inflows in the quarter so overall we had a net outflow of billion in the quarter and that included a billion very low fee institutional mandate that we were expecting and a bit over million in form of parent outflows this is a significant improvement from our results a year ago which compares very favorably to the active peers we benchmark against in fact we were number five in terms of flow rate driven by our strong showing in equities and improved fixed income flows as we look at april results gross sales remain strong and redemptions have slowed as equity markets have improved with regard to investment performance our equity performance has remained strong through this volatile period especially in key strategies like incomeoriented equities and while we did have some shortterm underperformance in fixed income in the quarter within some of our multisector strategies were seeing improvement in april longterm numbers across equities fixed income and asset allocation remain strong looking at our financial results clearly revenues will be impacted in this environment given the asset decline but were seeing good results in higher fee flows and markets coming back a bit will help were also doing a good job managing expenses as margins remain quite good we are managing controllable expenses while making sure that critical projects that align to our growth goals remain in place so to wrap up asset management id close by saying the teams are executing well and were focused on continuing our progress now lets turn to the strength of the company our balance sheet fundamentals and risk management ill start with our balance sheet its exceptionally strong we have approximately billion of liquidity we have billion of excess capital and we have a highquality diversified investment portfolio with an average rating of aa minus and limited exposure to industries that are under pressure our strong risk management prepares us for these type of volatile economic conditions our hedging program is excellent at effectiveness in a volatile period the business continues to generate good free cash flow that we invest for future growth and return to shareholders in the first quarter we continued to return capital well although we did pause our buyback given the uncertainty in the market with the strength of our business and capital position we will resume our buyback at an appropriate level as we move forward and as you saw we announced a increase in our quarterly dividend that we feel good about our 16th increase since we became a public company years ago in closing i feel good about our position and ability to navigate this environment were prepared for this environment to remain volatile with the underlying strength of our business the investments weve made the cash flow our diversified business generates and our capital management we have a very strong hand to play ameriprise is working through this crisis extremely well were able to weather these markets and economic headwinds and focus on longterm strategic priorities we will continue to focus on our clients our priorities and moving forward in the right way ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 now ill turn it over to walter and then well take your questions walter stanley berman chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics with adjusted operating eps up to this was driven by strong underlying trends i will describe today as well as a tax benefit in the quarter due to anticipated net operating losses for the year while the nol is extremely beneficial from an earnings and cash flow standpoint using our expected tax rate in the range our earnings per diluted share would still have been up a critical factor for ameriprise or candidly any other company during this period is a highquality balance sheet and risk management fundamentals that underpin the business including liquidity capital hedge effectiveness free cash flow generation and business continuity performance these foundational elements allow us to navigate the current environment well and have positioned us to continue delivering excellent results as we move through market cycles in the quarter gaap reported eps was reflecting the positive impact of our credit spread hedge valuation and other marketdriven impacts lets turn to page adjusted operating net revenue was up to billion after excluding auto home from the prioryear period revenue growth was driven by advice wealth management where we had an increase in wrap net flows of and improved transactional activity driving up increase in revenue eps for the quarter was as i indicated this reflects a tax benefit let me explain the use of net operating loss carrybacks was eliminated in the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of this ability was brought back on a temporary basis as part of a new legislation as a result ameriprise will receive a substantial gaap and operating tax reduction associated with our ability to carry back our estimated nols to prior higher tax periods using our latest forecast the tax benefit is estimated at million or million of the estimated full year benefit was taken in the first quarter based upon first quarter gaap earnings with respect to the full year forecast the benefit will be adjusted quarterly for the balance of the year based upon changes in markets and our forecast our numbers will be finalized on december the benefit allows us to continue to execute our current business strategy and operations and partially offset impacts of covid19 as i previously stated using our expected tax rate our eps would have increased versus last year our adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter was nearly lets turn to page there are four main balance sheet and risk attributes that are critical to continually meet client shareholder and regulatory requirements liquidity capital managing the level and volatility of earnings and effective operational risk management on all fronts we met this challenge and we are wellpositioned to meet our client and business needs going forward just as we have in prior market cycles at the end of the first quarter we had substantial liquidity at both the parent and subsidiaries totaling approximately billion with about billion at the holding company our excess capital ended the quarter at billion which reflects the impact of challenging interest rate and equity markets reduction in debt as well as the adoption of vm21 an important component of our capital strength is our investment portfolio it is defensively positioned and diversified with aa minus average credit quality i want to highlight that within our investmentgrade corporate portfolio we are concentrated in defensively positioned sectors that operate well with the current stayathome restrictions specifically us electric utilities food and beverage healthcare and usbased midstream pipeline ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 companies we have no exposure to airlines or specialty retailers and less than million of exposure to banking ph or autos and our highyield exposure is only of the portfolio and diversified by industry and issuer we closed the quarter in a net unrealized gain position of million but that improved to a net unrealized gain position of approximately billion by the end of april we have a robust hedging program which is an important component of managing earnings volatility it was effective in the quarter exceeding its target and we expect that to continue the benefit of these hedge programs are evidenced in the strong gaap numbers we reported that included a large gain from our hedges on a gaap basis our proactive risk management program is extensive and our swift transition to the vast majority of our staff working from home highlights the planning and capabilities we have established our business has performed well and as jim indicated we are seeing good business growth metrics continue ph and grow advice wealth management delivered very strong results in the quarter particularly in light of the market dislocation we experienced in march as you can see on slide advice wealth management adjusted operating net revenues grew results through february were very strong revenue was up with billion of wrap net inflows and transactional activity up as the environment change we continue to see solid engagement with advisors and clients we had an additional billion of wrap net inflows in march we saw cash levels increase substantially to nearly billion up from billion at year end and transactional levels remained strong client activity was strong in april pretax adjusted operating earnings grew or million in the face of a million headwind related to the fed rate cuts a strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite shortterm interest rates ga increased excluding the bank we are continuing to make investments for growth where we feel there is an appropriate payback in this environment while there is a potential for continued market volatility and shortterm interest rate pressure we believe that the strong activity trends and financial performance will continue during this changed environment our advisors remain totally engaged with their clients we have strong interest with our remote recruiting strategy and we have increased our net investment income by investing at higher spreads within the bank in the quarter we had new advisors with strong productivity levels joining ameriprise and a strong and growing pipeline asset management continues to generate substantial revenue and pretax adjusted operating earnings for ameriprise which you can see on page similar to the trends we saw in advice wealth management asset management delivered improved business metrics pretax adjusted operating revenue was up through february reflecting good market and higher fee net inflows but the trend was impacted in march from both market depreciation elevated redemptions and a performance fee adjustment excluding the performance fee adjustment operating net revenue were up for the full quarter in addition expense discipline remains strong driving earnings to million excluding the performance fee adjustment the adjusted margin in the quarter was nearly going forward we feel good about our product offerings investment performance and distribution capabilities that support continued gross sales improvement in higher fee assets going forward the fee rate was consistent at approximately basis points in the quarter and we remain committed to expense management in light of the revenue environment turning to page results in annuities and protection are in line with expectation in this market and rate environment variable annuities earnings declined to million in the quarter impacted by many of the same trends ive already discussed revenues increased as market appreciation was largely offset by continued net ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 outflows expenses increased from last year primarily related to two items first sop reserves continued to increase as expected and this was further exacerbated by market volatility second we had lower dac amortization a year ago impacting the yearoveryear comparison we anticipate that variable annuities earnings will return to more normalized levels going forward fixed annuity earnings declined to million this decline is largely driven by spread compression and lower account sizes protection delivers a very stable stream of earnings contributing million in the quarter with overall claims in line with expectation we expect these trends to continue we continue to feel good about our annuities and protection businesses we are seeing a shift in va sales ph through our new structured variable annuity product and we are seeing a shift from iul products to vul additionally we have made appropriate changes to our product features underwriting and pricing given the changes in the operating environment these enhancements position us well going forward now lets move to the balance sheet on slide ive already highlighted many of the elements of our balance sheet fundamentals that give me comfort in our positioning going forward our strong liquidity position substantial excess capital effective hedging and a defensively positioned investment portfolio a return to substantial level of capital to shareholders in the first quarter even after pausing our share repurchase in midmarch out of an abundance of caution with the environment we intend to resume buyback in short order and we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of to per share these actions demonstrated our commitment and ability to continue our longstanding track record of capital return lets turn to page this is a slide i used at our last investor day the statement remains on track our balance sheet and enterprise risk management capabilities were tested again and we have shown excellent results our underlying business drivers remain strong and will generate strong free cash flow in this low interest rate and volatile equity market environment we remain totally committed to strong sustainable profitable growth with that we will take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning my first question is on advice wealth management in the quarter you talked about a million headwind from the low shortterm rates in equity markets can you just help us frame what that looks like in terms of a headwind as we go into the second quarter walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes suneet its walter that will be approximately in total about million the million will move to million for the interest rate in awm on the short term suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and at that point youll fully have the interest rate impact embedded in the baseline walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes we believe that yes assuming no other changes suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah okay and then my other question is on the fixed annuity business earlier in the year i think you still were opportunistic about potentially doing a reinsurance transaction obviously since then rates have fallen pretty dramatically but spreads have also widened out so just trying to get an update in terms of how youre thinking about the ability to execute a reinsurance deal on that block in walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes execution will be difficult in this environment so were at a pause certainly our desire to do that is there and we would just wait until the environment allows us to do that suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and then the last one is just on the capital return you chose your words very carefully i think in terms of returning capital at an appropriate level can you just help us think through what that means i mean in the past youve talked about returning of your earnings can you just give us an update in terms of where youre thinking today is james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 yes suneet i think what we would say is we think we could still sort of track to what the ongoing earnings formula look like and be in range of what weve done in the past in that regard so i think again its hard to predict just based on the environment but i would say we feel very comfortable with both the excess capital position the cash flow generation and the earnings stream that we have coming about so i think you could calibrate from there probably still in the range of the to suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks good morning guys thanks for taking the question jim first a question for you just around dynamics in the recruiting environment today within advice wealth in the past weve obviously seen some moderation in fa recruiting activity in times of heightened volatility and presumably the dynamics of social distancing makes recruiting more challenging right now but curious to get your thoughts on kind of how the net new asset flows within awm are expected to trend over the next couple of quarters given this dynamic james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i think as you saw we were able to put a good group of recruits on board in the first quarter our pipeline looks good i mean as you went through the moving to workfromhome and what everyone had to do in the industry including competitive frame it sort of disrupted that a little bit but we were able very quickly to move to virtual we are operating really from that perspective in that regard including from a recruiting environment we have good engagements with potential recruits and so thats working well having said that youre still taking people and then moving in this environment and so with the volatility as you said things slowed down a little bit but the pipeline looks good and its more of what people feel comfortable making a transition but longer term we found that after these environments people do look to come to a strong firm they do look at a firm and how theyve operated through an environment like this and we feel very good about the value proposition as well as the interest so we feel like that could pick up as things settle down as weve been active in the marketplace regarding our flows weve had very strong client flows in the first quarter including through march and those flows continue in april of course they were always a little bit higher in january and february but they maintained at a very good level through march and into april so we still feel good about the flow picture alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great and just maybe a little bit more around the pipeline commentary you just mentioned can you give us a sense the composition between the kind of independent franchisee channel and the employee channel which one of these is likely to fare better in the current environment from fas moving over versus where you might actually see a little bit of a slowdown because of the environment james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 so we see strong interest in both we still see it in the employee channel because of the type of arrangements that we have here the support they get all of the enhanced benefits that theyre very used to both in our employee model and a franchisee model and were actually seeing independents as well as some rias come back because of the really enhanced value proposition that we provide even into our franchisees and so they get all the benefits that they would have gotten if they were an employee in a certain respect of the type of support the branding the technology even the onboarding which is done in a very comprehensive fashion based on how we support them and set them up so i would just say that our value proposition is playing quite well right now as people are realizing they need more than to just associate with an independent channel or just that they could buy services out there from an independent channel so were finding from both ends that the interest is quite strong and these are the people that we are attracting alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for that and then just a quick followup for walter just a couple of numbers around the bank could you help us with what the net interest income and the net interest margin was at the bank in the second quarter just given the fact that its becoming a larger contributor to the overall and then maybe give us a sense for expectations or future cash moving out of the offbalance sheet cash sweep into the bank and the sort of the new money nim that you guys could earn on that today thanks walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc alex its walter yeah obviously the bank is still in a marginal situation as its beginning to take hold certainly i can tell you that from the activities that we saw we started to invest substantially from the bank at taking advantages of the spread income so we anticipate that the bank will be making a more significant contribution going forward but still in a measured basis so right now its just early to say as we move through it but the margin is quite strong obviously the interest margin is quite strong but we did take advantage of the situation to improve that by making some investments with some pretty large spreads as we moved through and we are certainly focusing more on the bank as we move through the year and go beyond that alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore david motemaden q analyst evercore group llc hi good morning this is david motemaden on for tom i guess i just had a question on the us treasury ultimate interest rate assumption i guess just wondering how youre feeling about that heading into the third quarter review given the drop in rates and maybe remind us what the impact would be of lowering that maybe basis points and maybe just talk about what sort of ongoing impact that may have walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc so this is walter so as i previously indicated certainly we are evaluating we do believe still as we look at it it is still aberrational from that standpoint well certainly take a deep review in the third quarter one of the things it ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 is a couple hundred million dollars as i indicated but i just want to make sure we all understand yes that is a couple hundred million dollars but that has no impact on our excess capital as we evaluate that and so we will be taking a look again and evaluating it but again no impact to our excess capital david motemaden q analyst evercore group llc got it understood james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and walter i think that that would be beyond the basis points thats not just for walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc that would actually yes that would be if you take a look at moving that both on the glide path and on the interest rate so it would be looking at both those items that have been raised and that we previously discussed david motemaden q analyst evercore group llc got it and so youre saying couple hundred million given both of those things but no other specifics around sort of what you guys are thinking about walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc look right now the actuary is evaluated that we certainly look as you saw ph where the spread really increased so that threw while the treasury went down the spread went up so you throw a multitude of factors going in so those are all the things ph theyre taking into consideration and certainly we will be taking a deeperdive look as we head into the third quarter to reassess that but theres still a lot of aberration going through that but david motemaden q analyst evercore group llc got it yeah thats fair and then just following up on the bank i understand you guys injected million into the bank which is one of the reasons why the excess capital went down i guess what size does that in terms of on balance sheet bank assets does that contemplate versus the billion at the end of the first quarter and then you spoke about million of a sequential drag from rates in awm does that include considering shifting assets out of sweep and into the bank and i guess i would think that that would provide somewhat of an offset to that million but im not sure if thats in there or not walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah again that is certainly we will get an offset as we shift the assets on to the balance sheet and we start getting in the spread income ph as it relates to because right now in the sweep accounts it is marginal profitability based on the fed taking it down to zero certainly we have some profitability there but that is one of the advantage we will have with the bank as we move and we start getting the spread coming through diversified investment loan investment portfolio there and weve already saw some of that advantage starting to ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 take hold as we invested at the end of the first quarter and investing into april and the majority of that is on again pretty much there is close on the million i would say that it has a factor within it but we do anticipate benefits coming from the bank as we move through and forward david motemaden q analyst evercore group llc okay great thank you for the answers i appreciate it walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thanks could you talk about what percent of your commercial real estate portfolio was in rentals for barrons for april and maybe what your expectations are for may walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc that are in where im sorry can you repeat that john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co rental for barrons seeking rent ph relief walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay right now were getting some coming in its actually been small were talking to maybe about less than of the balances are asking for that but youve got to remember the portfolio is extremely strong using the fundamentals as it relates to loantovalue at and looking at our debt coverage which is leverage coverage was so this is a portfolio weve been in with a long time but we are seeing some but again strong fundamentals and we are working with them obviously but we do not anticipate a significant cash flow issue at all at this stage john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co great thank you very much and then my followup question a lot of people are working from home right now in your organization and others how do you view a return to work environment emerging do you see going back or do you see there being a real estate and expense savings emerging thank you for the answers james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 so i think we and all of the businesses are really reviewing this now and so our philosophy and our principles will be that we are ph guarding the health and safety of all our people weve been able to work remotely with no disruptions and really support our client activity really well having said that as you would imagine some people want to get back to work some people would like to engage a little more facetoface and therefore we are looking at sort of a phased approach for reentry and the phased approach will be really triggered by every one of the states individually and locales individually of what we feel is appropriate and safe as far as people reentering the workforce and then all of our facilities are being set up so that they can accommodate that on a gradual reentry basis so i cant sit here and tell you it will be what i could say is that things as they improve in the locales where we do business we will start reentry on a gradual basis a phased approach i think in the end were finding that there are some things where people can work remotely quite well and may want to do that on a balanced equation in which case we can accommodate and maybe over time move more to virtual that were also reviewing based on the way we can do business we have excellent technology capabilities were all set up in the cloud and so our environments are able to accommodate that and enhance the way people operate in doing it that way so i think well see over time that probably of what was where we were even though we have flexibility and workfromhome well probably get more so as businesses move forward walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc its walter i would just add to what jim said to your question about savings yes we certainly would anticipate getting savings as it relates to te and other aspects of printing and on that basis and ph eventually real estate so it really does afford us a process reevaluation because we have been so effective in working from home and so i think that thats what jims asked us to evaluate but theres certainly potential john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners good morning and thank you for taking my questions just to follow on that line of questioning in terms of expenses i think you indicated earlier this year youre looking at opportunities for further expense reengineering can you talk about how youre thinking about ga expenses outlook now for the coming quarters as you start to maybe potentially implementing some reengineering james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah let me start and then ill have walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well or jim do you want to take a shot ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah let me start and then ill have walter complement it so our business as you saw is performing quite well we have really good client engagement and activity and we would like to continue to keep that focus weve made some really good investments as we told you over the last few years and particularly we had accelerated some of those last year that weve sort of completed which was great the timing was excellent for us and as you saw in the first quarter overall for the firm our expenses came down and actually were quite good and tight and even in awm where we were making some of those expenses the actual expense rate ex the bank was only up with revenue growth so we are now what were doing is as walter said in the last question we have tightened up as you would imagine things like te and all that stuff discretionary programs things that dont make sense in this environment that will give us savings my team and i are already working on what other reengineering opportunities but were also looking to protect the staff we dont want to reduce staff due to the pandemic and we have good people and as long as theyre really productive which we are driving in a sense of what we can do we want to keep and maintain that but weve restricted new hirings additional hirings et cetera weve looked at everything that is more controllable on a case bycase basis and well continue to do so and based upon how things are playing out even including to the last question we see opportunities that we could reduce expenses going forward now with that well always work to enhance our reengineering processes which we have in place but the tax benefit does give us a little more leeway and that was what its for relief on so that we can maintain our staff levels a bit more at the same time that we work through this pandemic so we feel really good but we will control expenses tightly but we will try to maintain the flexibility so that we dont have to hit the staff levels which i think would be really positive because we have a good business and we have good people walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc this is walter ill just add ph to jims because he covered pretty much it we always to your point are very focused on ensuring that we have process and improvements that relate to reengineering opportunities and as jim said we just with this change heightened that and thats really so what were feeling that we are certainly focusing on that category to ensure that we are effective and are protecting margins from that standpoint to the degree we can okay so it is really a major focus on the part of the firm humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners thats helpful and then i know for protection its a relatively small part of the business and also you have ph the closed ltc book as we think about the impacts from covid19 can you provide some color in terms of the claims exposure how should we think about the net mortality sensitivity to the number of deaths that you may see walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc sure and certainly from our standpoint weve evaluated our coverage both from protection standpoint and also looking at some of the benefits that you derive in the other products one thing to keep in mind is of our mortality is reinsured so we have a substantial benefit and weve looked at all the aspects of the protection annuities longterm care offsets the impact to us is minimal and when weve done evaluations on and as it looks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 at if theres deaths couplehundred thousand deaths so we feel very comfortable with our proactive approach to this and the way weve managed that humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners got it thank you operator the last question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning so i want to drill down a little bit more on some of the earlier questions particularly with regard to the bank could you give a sense of where youre investing and the durations of those investments and then in terms of where the assets are coming is it predominantly coming from the sweep accounts which now total over billion and could you get a large chunk of those sweep assets walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc so andrew its walter let me take a shot so we previously have been certainly positioned in floaters from a mortgagebacked floaters and things but what we did is we really heightened that when we saw that we there was a huge opportunity to get spread with highquality paper and so we invested a substantial amount in basically fixed term that was giving us benefits that were giving us basis points spreads and so we were feeling comfortable about that and we deployed money as it relates to that and yes the majority of the money is coming from certainly sweep but some money is just coming into the bank from our clientele so yes i think it gives us a good opportunity to really get spread income especially when the sweep accounts are really now dropped to minimum minimal earning rates from fed funds andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and so walter do you think you can get a large chunk of that sweep business walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc we can transfer in yes we can still have opportunity to transfer more into the bank certainly andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc terrific and then this is kind of a tough one just given the investment management environment but you mentioned how retail sales were up yearoveryear in the quarter you certainly ended the fourth quarter on a very high note with improvement so as you look out to the subsequent quarters and maybe its just too hard but do you think you can replicate the improvement in the near term that we saw in the fourth quarter or is it just going to be a very pressured environment as we look to the next three quarters james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020 so andrew thank you for asking that it is one of if you looked at the quarter on a relative basis to a lot of the competitive frame thats been in close to 10plus billion of outflows in the quarter for a number of them we were quite good and the main outflow for us was really in a very lowfee account just like a few basis points and some exparent activity which we usually get from the insurance book but if you looked at the improvement as i mentioned in the january and february we were strongly nice net inflow and then with the ph extra redemptions in march and those redemptions sort of have slowed now that the markets stabilized a bit that youre going to see when the market get more volatile like that people start to reallocate or go to cash the sales through april are opening up quite well on a consistent basis which is real positive and were good about that and our institutional we have some good product that there has some interest in so we feel still good about this this is one that were not taking our foot off the pedal here we feel light we got good product to sell out there and our product is performing well in many categories so no were hoping that this will continue and thats really been our focus and you can sort of track that improvement over the last number of quarters and even with the dislocation that has occurred you can even look at our outflows compared to the industry which are quite improved and on a relative basis quite good so thats where were going to continue to maintain the focus we think the teams doing a good job of keeping that focus even in this environment where people are working from home andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and then just lastly i kind of this whole environment makes me think back to and you made that despite the pressures in the asset management sector columbia has been a fabulous acquisition what are you seeing out there right now are there opportunities do you want to kind of sit tight with your excess capital because there might be an opportunity in lieu of buybacks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so we always as weve mentioned to you we feel like and thats what we explained to you through the discussion we had at the end of the last year at our community meeting that we do have a good hand weve made a lot of improvements we got good product weve enhanced our distribution capabilities our technology capabilities and so were continuing on that path and we feel good that we can continue to make good progress there again i do believe that you will find that sometimes when you have dislocations people realize that maybe there are some other things that you should look at maybe consolidation will continue to occur in that light so we have capability weve been one of the few firms that have successfully acquired and integrated we know that we have that capability at the same time were not looking to rush out to do anything right now we dont need to we have a good but we have flexibility in case something comes along strategically that can be a complement to what we have so were just looking and as we said we feel good about where we are we feel good about how our capital situation but also our earnings so but if something comes along down the road that makes some sense well look at it but right now we really dont have any impetus to want to drive to something at this point in time unless it really fits neatly andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks a lot ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 07may2020
