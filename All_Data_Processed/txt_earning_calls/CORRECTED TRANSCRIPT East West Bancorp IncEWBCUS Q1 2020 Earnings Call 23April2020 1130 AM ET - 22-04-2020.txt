billion in loans for over small to mediumsized businesses and nonprofit organizations by the way it took east west bank a full decade to originate billion in sba loans in comparison we funded about billion of ppp sba loans in just two weeks we had to because funding these new loans so quickly will help save hundreds of thousands of jobs across these communities where we work and live my inbox is

are thriving before this crisis and we will help them thrive again audio gap the pandemic is over now i will move on to review our financial condition and the results of the first quarter lets go to slide number in the first quarter we earned net income of million or per share compared to fourth quarter net income of million or per share the quarteroverquarter decrease largely reflects an increased provision for credit losses in light of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the covid19 pandemic we generated total revenue of million and earned pretax preprovision income of million equivalent to a pretax preprovision profitability ratio of in the first quarter an important variable helping us consistently generate attractive profitability is our industryleading low efficiency ratio in the first quarter our adjusted operating efficiency ratio was our first quarter return on asset was return on equity was and return on tangible equity was moving on to slide number from an enterprise risk management perspective were entering the crisis from a position of strength our balance sheet is strong we have high levels of liquidity and capital and our loan and deposit portfolios are well diversified in the first quarter we grew total loans by annualized and deposit by annualized our loantodeposit ratio as of march was stable relative to the past several quarters as we have said before we consider a range of to to be a comfortable operating range balancing east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 considerations of onbalance sheet liquidity with profitability the allowance coverage of our loans is strong and additionally this quarter we increased it to furthermore we have ample liquidity and available borrowing capacity to fund loans for our customers if its ever needed as of march our unused available borrowing capacity was billion which is sizable compared to our balance sheet size of almost billion you can see on slide that east west capital ratios are strong in fact we have some of the highest capital ratios amongst regional banks this quarter we took some actions to return capital to our shareholders since our announcement of a stock repurchase program in early march through march we repurchased million or million shares of common stock in addition east west board of directors has declared second quarter dividends for the companys common stock common stock cash dividend of is payable on may to stockholders of record on may our strong pretax preprovision income and capital levels allow us to maintain our dividend even in light of the challenging economic conditions moving on to slide as of march total loans reached a record billion an increase of billion or linked quarter annualized average loan of billion grew by linked quarter annualized endofperiod loan growth was driven by all three of our major loan portfolios ci commercial real estate and residential mortgage average loan growth in the quarter was driven by cre which grew linked quarter annualized and by residential mortgage which grew linked quarter annualized both of these portfolios grew evenly throughout the quarter and both have continued into april as loans previously in the pipeline continued to close on the other hand average ci loans decreased by linked quarter annualized our ci loan growth was backend loaded in march we saw increased line utilization in our ci portfolio this quarter as of march our ci line utilization was which increased from as of december our greater china portfolio was billion as of march and it decreased by million from yearend so far credit concerns resulting from covid19 pandemic as well as requests for loan forbearance have been very limited credit quality in that portfolio remains stable and we are being prudent about loan growth at this point continue on to slide we added a more detailed breakdown about ci loan portfolio the largest segments within ci are general manufacturing wholesale oil gas and private equity all of which are equivalent to of total loans followed by entertainment which is equivalent to of total loans our ci exposure to travel leisure hospitality restaurant and restaurant supply all combined together represents less than of our total loan portfolio we dont believe they are of material credit concerns in these segments our oil gas exposure as of march was billion of loans outstanding and billion of total commitments based on commitment of our exposure is to customers in exploration and production to midstream and downstream clients and to oilfield services and other the composition of our clients ep production is oil gas and natural gas liquids the majority of the ep production loans are hedged for and some of them are hedged even through in light of the volatile market conditions for oil and gas we increased our acl coverage against portfolio to approximately on slide and we have added additional details of our commercial real estate portfolio our cre portfolio of billion is well balanced across the major property types of retail multifamily office industrial and east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 hospitality construction land exposure for us is very small the geographic distribution of our portfolio generally reflect our branch footprint you can see on slide that our weighted average ltv of our portfolio is and that loan with an ltv of over make up only of of the total portfolio in the chart on the righthand side you can see that the weighted average ltv of our loans are consistent by property type we have a long history of low credit losses in our multifamily and incomeproducing cre portfolios through many credit cycles over the decades and the consistency of our low ltv underwriting is an important contributing factor on slide we have included additional information about our hospitality retail and construction land portfolios again the geographic distribution of these portfolios generally follows the geographic footprint of our branches with the largest concentrations of indiscernible a high percentage of our borrowers have substantial net worth provide us with personal guarantees and put substantial equity into their buildings or projects we partner with experienced operators industries and developers and many of our customers have longterm relationship with east west spanning decades and multiple financing collaborations the weighted average loantovalue on our hospitality portfolio is a low and are full service hotels and are limited service hotel a great majority of our hotels are in primary markets ph many of that are franchises the weighted average ltv of our retail portfolio is also a low is in small strip centers under square feet in size this is also reflected in the low average loan size of million for our retail cre restaurants make up of retail cre and have an average loan size of a little under million and average ltv of the vast majority of our retail cre borrowers also provide personal guarantees to help support these credits construction land exposure for us is very small and is well diversified by property type with a weighted average ltv a low based on commitment moving on to slide you can see the geographic distribution of our residential mortgage portfolio which similar to cre follows our branch footprint our residential mortgage are primarily originated via our branches and their local networks of real estate professionals the average loan size in our portfolio is only and only of our loans have an ltv over ph for core low ltv singlefamily mortgage portfolio we have a long history of low credit losses in the first quarter we originated million of residential mortgage loans which is on par with the origination volume in the fourth quarter of last year the origination mix in the first quarter was evenly split between fixed and variable rate loans consistent with recent quarters we saw an increase in refinance transactions which increased to of origination volume in the first quarter up from a recent run rate of for your information we recently migrated our process so that over of our mortgage originations are now received digitally allowing loan production to continue in april despite of the impact of stayathome orders i would now turn the call over to irene for more detailed discussions of our allowances and asset quality deposit and income statement irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic turning to slide for a review of our allowance for credit losses and slide for a review of our other asset quality metrics at march our allowance for credit losses totaled million or of loans held for investment compared to million or as of december quarteroverquarter the loan reserve increased by million including million from the adoption of the new current expected east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 credit loss model or cecl accounting standard on on january which increased the reserve coverage on loans to sic up from during the first quarter of we booked a million provision for credit losses which increased reserve coverage to reflecting the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the covid pandemic we attribute of provision expense in the first quarter ph to reserve build and to the billion net loan growth in the quarter the moodys economic scenarios inform the three models we use to calculate cecl reserves and as of march our reserve reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment and our expected losses for indiscernible furthermore given the strength of our capital and pretax preprovision earnings levels we have the capacity to manage any losses that might be above the level of allowance as of march turning to slide you can see that outside from the increase to the reserve in the first quarter the impact of the pandemic crisis is not yet evident in our other asset quality metrics as of march and they remain strong net chargeoffs in the first quarter were a low resulting in a net chargeoff ratio of basis point of average loans annualized during the quarter gross chargeoffs of million primarily from ci loans were almost entirely offset by recoveries million from total cre and million from ci ci chargeoffs in the first quarter were primarily from our oil gas portfolio on loans previously identified as substandard which had been reserved for in full as of december the criticized to total loans ratio was as of march ticking down by basis points from as of december the classified loan ratio decreased to of total loans as of march down by basis points from as of ph year end nonperforming assets as of march were million or basis points of total assets compared to basis points of total assets as of december and basis points of total assets as of march during the quarter ph reo assets increased by million as we took possession of a retail commercial real estate property located in southern california after over a decade of litigation now moving to slide for a discussion of deposits total deposits grew to a record billion as of march an increase of billion or linked quarter annualized average deposits of billion grew million or linked quarter annualized average deposit growth for the first quarter primarily came from money market and noninterest bearing demand accounts offset by a decrease in interestbearing checking in the second quarter our funding costs will continue to benefit from the repricing of maturing time deposits as of march we have billion in time deposits maturing in the second quarter at a weighted average rate of the third quarter of we have another billion maturing at a weighted average rate of followed by billion maturing in the fourth quarter at a weighted average rate of for context we originated or renewed million of time deposits monthtodate in april at a rate of basis points compared to billion in march at a rate of basis points and billion in february at a rate of basis points the monthovermonth decline in time deposits reflects the changes we have made to our deposit pricing resulting from the basis points of fed funds rate cuts in march and now moving on to a discussion of our income statement starting with slide we will review the components of the income statement in subsequent slides as well the effective tax rate was in the first quarter compared to in the fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares decreased by due to share repurchase activity during the first quarter given the current volatility and uncertainty about the length of time that east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 the covid19 crisis will last and the consequent widespread and sustained impact to the economy we will be suspending the publishing of our full year management outlook with that said with our strong capital position strong allowance for credit losses combined with proactive management to minimize credit exposures and to control operating expenses we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever once we have more visibility we will resume guidance on slides and we will review our net interest income and net interest margin first quarter net interest income of million decreased by linked quarter the first quarter net interest margin was a contraction of basis points from the prior quarter against the backdrop of materially lower interest rates during the first quarter declines in earning asset yields were largely offset by decreases in the cost of funds the quarteroverquarter change in our net interest margin is as follows basis points decrease from lower loan yields including fees recoveries and discounts a basis point decrease from lower yields on other earning assets a basis point decrease from balance sheet mix shift all of which were partially offset by basis points increase from lower funding costs continuing to slide the average loan yield in the first quarter was for down basis points from the prior quarter monthovermonth between march and february the monthly average sfr loan yield was essentially unchanged monthly average ci loan yield compressed by about basis points and cre about basis points as of march fixed rate loans and hybrid loans still in their fixed period made up of our total loans of our loans were linked to onemonth and threemonth libor rates and were tied to the prime rate the first quarter average cost of deposits decreased by basis points linked quarter to basis points and the average cost of interestbearing deposits decreased by basis points to as of march our end of period cost of total deposits was basis points down basis points from february month to date as of april our cost of total deposits decreased another basis points to basis points as of march our end of period cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points down basis points from february month to date as of april our cost of interestbearing deposits further decreased basis points to basis points now turning to slide total noninterest income in the first quarter was million a decrease of compared to million in the fourth quarter the driver of the quarteroverquarter decrease was a negative million credit valuation adjustment largely related to customer interest rate swaps resulting from the movement in rates as of march compared to december ph fee income and net gains on sales of loans of million in the first quarter were up million or from the fourth quarter customerdriven interest rate contract revenue was stable quarteroverquarter at million in other fee income categories quarteroverquarter foreign exchange income of million increased by million wealth management fees of million increased by million and lending fees of million decreased by million moving on to slide first quarter noninterest expense was million a decrease of linked quarter and yearoveryear excluding the amortization of tax credit investments and cdi our adjusted noninterest expense was million in the first quarter a decrease of quarteroverquarter and flat yearoveryear the largest linked quarter change was a decrease in other operating expense resulting from lower travel expenses advertising and promotions east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 first quarter compensation and employee benefits expense was million an increase of quarterover quarter due to seasonally high payroll expenses in the first quarter and essentially flat yearoveryear our first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was with that i will now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene well for more than four decades east west has weathered various credit cycles and macroeconomic environments emerging stronger on the other side of them every single time i believe that with our strong capital liquidity position and our low customer base were entering this cycle from a position of strength during these unprecedented times we continue to be focused on the most important task at hand for us helping our customers navigate the challenges ahead so that they can thrive when this crisis is resolved ive never been more proud of our associates for going above and beyond and demonstrating our east west culture and values and i wish to thank all of them for their dedications and commitment i will now open the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today will come from ebrahim poonawala please go ahead with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to touch upon credit in terms of ph so you raised some good points around capital spend ph or earnings power when you look at the loan losses indiscernible at at the end of the quarter i was wondering if you can talk about what i think you mentioned like moodys scenarios indiscernible as you sort of updated your cecl reserves what are you assuming in that reserve in terms of the shape of the recovery your loss rates if you can speak to that and in particular dominic would really love some color around the energy book the entertainment book because those are two where dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yes east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc theres a little bit high degree of concern around how the losses might transpire irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc so ebrahim ill start with kind of our allowance methodology for east west we had utilized moodys for our stress test and that evolved with cecl and the the scenarios and the models that we use to develop our cecl reserve were what moodys published on so the shape of that is if were going with letters uish and then thats what well kind of continue to look at as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we have three different models for cre ci and then singlefamily and with the moodys scenarios as a backdrop weve also layered in our loss experience that weve had and certainly other factors where we look at the portfolio to ensure that we have appropriately reserved for any reset we see dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc so on the question on what are the portfolio that you would like me to highlight again ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc indiscernible so two things just with the ci book ph ive got energy and entertainment and dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and if theres anything else that you are particularly worried about dominic that would ph be great dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay so energy and entertainment double e okay what i will start with just with energy we shared with you earlier about we have billion of energy loans outstanding the vast majority of them are the ep reserve lending which obviously we were very much focused on doing more reserve lending because if you look back several years ago reserve lending with high collateral value tend to not have as much losses and the losses that happened a few years ago were mainly in the oil services and some of the downstream and so forth but in this cycle things are little bit different obviously we see what the price deck looks like ph now whats happening on a weekly basis if we checked out on the oil and gas prices they obviously do not look very good even for the ep production loans but as i said earlier the majority of our customers do have hedges in place and for some of them even extend beyond well see how much of this price depression will continue i mean ph if this linger on well beyond obviously many oil gas loans like many other banks will have these challenges ph we adjust temporarily for a few months and then somehow it come back stronger again or for whatever reason ph there are any kind of government stimulus program that potentially can support it that would east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 change the dynamic we dont know at this point so all we can do is that with the best estimate and being a little bit more conservative and provide as much reserve as we feel is necessary and thats why we set aside for this portfolio moving on to entertainment i feel very comfortable with the entertainment portfolio today when we first started nine years ago many of our entertainment ph then loans were for theatrical release production financing wellcollateralized by foreign distribution rights tax credit and so forth today most of our lending when it comes to content development production are for streaming it goes to netflix to amazon apple et cetera in fact our entertainment lending in china ph are predominantly to streaming television production and internet streaming companies contract and so forth so we do not have much exposure at all we have no exposure to theaters we have no exposure very very few exposure with movies and even with the movies we have fully collateralized and already have completed with distribution rights and tax credit ph and so forth all available so we feel that currently were in a pretty good shape when it comes to entertainment business so anything else that you would have any concern that you would like to ask in terms of the ci portfolio ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc ph so then only just a followup to that irene should we expect or what level of reserve build should we expect from here if you can talk to that and thanks for taking my questions irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah ebrahim i think that is the question of the earnings season for us and for other banks honestly at this point and thats why we kind of have discontinued providing guidance we simply do not have a lot of clarity on that and to even give a range we want to make sure that were reserving the appropriate amount given the risks in our portfolio and well evaluate and certainly as we continue on in the quarter well continue to look at our portfolio to see whats appropriate and book the amount that we think we need to operator thank you our next question will come from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i certainly appreciate all the i do appreciate all the new information that youve given us especially on slide in terms of whats so your current rates but is there a way you can just sort of combine all this for us i know youre not giving guidance necessarily but if we kind of strip out the ppp program and just really look at your core east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 portfolio like how do you envision sort of the net impact of all the deposit and asset changes in terms of your net interest margin going into second quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well i want to clarify the impact of ppp wasnt in for the first quarter so that will be now really a new development for the second quarter certainly with kind of where the fed funds rates are and also longer term rates we do expect that the margin and the loan yields will come down were doing our darnedest to make sure on the funding side and on the deposit side were lowering rates thats why weve provided all that transparency ken about the cds as well ph and repricing downward of that dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well second quarter also will be an unusual quarter because we already booked billion of ci loans to the ppp program so it is not usually a normal quarter and we i mean once the second program started we start booking some again and so clearly i wouldnt count that as a normal way of originating ci loans irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i dont think we had it in our prepared remarks so ill just share that the processing fee income that we expect from the billion that we booked is about million operator our next question will come from michael young of suntrust please go ahead with your question michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question wanted to just ask on the expense side obviously good operating efficiency again but as revenue maybe falls depending on the ppp program should we expect that same level of efficiency going forward and were there any kind of onetime expenses or trueups this quarter that may not repeat going forward irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so the efficiency ratio will certainly be a function of the revenue number when we look at the actual expense during the quarter i would say there isnt anything that unusual we are doing our jobs as a management team to ensure that were looking at all the expenses very carefully in any environment we do that but certainly now first quarter theres always some seasonality with payroll costs so thats probably about million increase in first quarter but yearoveryear pretty comparable operator our next question will come from jared shaw of wells fargo securities please go ahead with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just looking at growth you had a great growth in ci this quarter and then you have the ppp loans coming on and the good sfr growth should we assume that ci is that this growth rate is a little more sustainable this is different from what youve had in the last few quarters where it seems like youve been deemphasizing ci is this more a function of just higher utilization from covid or is this good sustainable growth at this point dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well the ppp again is in the second quarter right so clearly i can expect second quarter ph is again going to be a nice ci growth but if we go back to the first quarter clearly the high utilization is a factor for our ci growth we do have new customers that we brought in from other banks and new deals that we worked on in the first in january and february a little bit but when it comes to march i think i would say the majority of the growth comes from higher utilization from our customers private equity funds that just wanted to draw down a little bit more money funding commitment so those are kind of things that are similar to other banks operator our next question will come from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible hey how are you doing i want to come back to the prior question on the margin just to make sure im conceptually thinking about it if we exclude the impact of ppp my memory serves me and correct me if im wrong that each cut by the fed was around basis points to nim so with ph six4305 cuts some pretty meaningful potential offsets i know you guys are being aggressive on the deposits but is that the right way to think im just trying to get a sense of how much of the loan yields have yet to reprice given the dynamic with fed funds and floors and so maybe you could just open up about that thatd be great irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah indiscernible so normally we provide as part of our investor relations deck kind of the breakdown of our loan book by index and how much is fixed and we can share that with you afterwards thats not part of our earnings release deck this quarter and the composition hasnt really changed so if you look at that a lot of the ci loans vast majority and then also the cre loans have repriced at the end of the quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 so when we look at really where the opportunities are one mix change we also with kind of the volatility and where rates were took advantage and entered into some lower cost kind of payfixed swaps to kind of help reduce our funding costs as well so there are some there are things that weve done to take advantage of kind of the dislocation in the market and to help as far as on the funding side kind of to add to my earlier kind of prepared remarks i think our opportunity really is on the cost side of what we can do to lower that in a more rapid pace right but i think if round numbers here if we look at it ph exppp we do think that the nim can go to a little over because of our ability to take down the deposit costs and well outperform lets say basis points over rate cuts operator our next question will come from brock vandervliet please go ahead with your question brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks very much good morning just a followup on an earlier expense question do you kind of view this as i know youre looking at expenses all the time but do view this dislocation as exactly that or something that may be more lasting and warrants a harder look on the expense side dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think that no one really know audio gap this pandemic impact as the reason why most banks are not providing guidance because we really dont know hows it going to turn into i mean is it going to be sitting at home for another month or so or is that sitting at home for another three months and when the economy do come back is it a v shape or a u shape to what extent people can some industries have a hard time to come back because of lifestyle changes and so forth there are many many many questions out there that people would need to ask and then how this economy would turn into after the pandemic and no one knows i mean we had the opportunity to look at whats happening in china because our greater china team start dealing with the pandemic in late january when it was a pretty much a whole country complete shutdown and for an extended period of time we saw that the factory workers are going back to work banking is more or less now getting back like usual but then there are still certain type of business are not doing as well like others so were going to need to look at whats going to happen in us because us is not china so our behavior are going to be different at this stage i think you can sort of like rest assure east west has always been very proactive in managing our business so we feel its appropriate to take a much more aggressive reduction of expenses we would definitely be the one looking actively into it and if we see that is something that we are not sure whether it is temporary or permanent i think that we would not be unwise to start taking down lets say certain infrastructure to hurt our longterm growth opportunity were always nimble while were always nimble and we move really really fast the fact is we are much more longterm driven in terms of looking into sustainable profitable and expandable growth in the long run more than just any kind of quarterbyquarter kind of results so thats the kind of philosophy we have and thats what were going to do and watching it on a daily weekly basis and see what we need to do east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 operator our next question will come from lana chan of bmo please go ahead with your question lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states hi good morning i wanted to see if you could give us how much of your loans has had payment deferrals so far irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc sure lana if i look at the numbers here well ill start with ci and commercial real estate or commercial loans as of the actual modifications and forbearances were actually pretty low about million as of today we probably double that so million i would share though on top of the million there are probably another million as far as loans where were having conversations with borrowers who have asked for some sort of modification ill also add that in the month of march we wanted to make sure that we could help our business customers particularly the small business customers who were suffering with the shutins and the frenetic nature of things then and then we did offer kind of accommodations for them largely to help them given the frenetic nature of what was happening more so than from a perspective of concern about the cash flow so thats something that we also did as well so those numbers are a little bit higher but it was short term in nature on the singlefamily side we have also we are in states where there are lot of kind of other programs from governors as far as modifications put in place if we look as of the total amount of deferred payments was about million on a balance of approximately million i dont have that specific today but certainly those numbers have come up from there operator our next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead with your question gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just wondering if you could just talk about how youre planning to fund the ppp loans will it be through onbalance sheet liquidity or through one of the programs irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah at this point in time we have strong deposits and we are funding the ppp program through our liquidity that we have we do expect though that we would likely we filed the paperwork well likely audio gap those loans pledge them and use the pppl program to fund part of it operator our next question comes from david chiaverini of wedbush please go ahead with your question david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks so i had a followup on slide where you provided the spot rates on deposits i was wondering if you could provide the spot rate on loans and then i had a followup on the loan modifications and deferrals how far out are you going are you doing three months and are you willing to go further if the lockdowns persist east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc so ill start with forbearances and the modifications for single family most of the ones that we have done are and that well roll that forward to another if the borrowers need it on the commercial side it varies much more so but at this point in time i dont think weve done any modifications or have any plans to that are beyond six months certainly if the customer needs it if the environment is very different we will extend that out and were very flexible as far as from the perspective of what we need to do to limit our loss content on the spot rate of the loans as of i dont believe i have that information in front of me dave but julianna and i can get that for you after the call dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i want to add also for these like singlefamily mortgages and because the ltv is so low as i highlighted earlier that we actually only have of our customers on the singlefamily mortgage portfolio that have more than of ltv so it is actually quite comfortable to make any kind of payment deferral arrangement because if we take on these additional deferrals and the ltv would still be extraordinarily low so the loss likelihood is zero and we have very very similar situation for our commercial real estate obviously with that very very low ltv again all across the board again any kind of deferral if we need to make it really doesnt make any difference in terms of potential losses going forward so we are very very comfortable about working with these customers to help them on this temporary transition and frankly many of our commercial customers in their lets say hotels and ph hospitality and then restaurant business do get ppp so that they would be able to get by with the ppp funding for the next two months or so so hopefully they will not even need to get much help from us well see operator operator instructions our next question comes from dave rochester of compass point please go ahead with your questions david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i appreciated all the color on some of the social distancing exposures in the deck was just wondering if you had your total for leverage loans as well and then just a followup on energy credit how far along are you guys in that spring redetermination process and how much are you seeing those lines come in as a part of that and where is your price deck now thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 so dave ill start with the leverage lending exposure as of we had about billion in leverage lending and historically and kind of related to that weve had a term b portfolio and that as of was million obviously the leverage lending of the term b portfolio correlate ph quite a bit together on the energy loans and kind of the spring redetermination weve started that process from our conversations and the feedback were getting from the team where are the evaluation that were doing about in some of those lines certainly have been cut and we expect that that will continue operator our final question today comes from lana chan as a followup with bmo please go ahead with your question lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states hi thank you just wanted to follow up about plans for continuing with the stock buyback given the covid situation dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we obviously have plenty of capital in fact and so finally i think in early march we made the announcement of the buyback program didnt last long because by the time we have got through less than two weeks its earnings period coming soon so were in a dark period and then wasnt able to execute but in the meantime right around the same time we all get locked down and stayed at home so from that perspective i think that we will continue to evaluate with our board i mean we already got the authorization of million we have only used up 100someodd millions we still have plenty of capital and so but at this stage right now we will continue to evaluate and then if we feel that the stock price is at the level that ph warrant for us to potentially do more buyback we would definitely consider that and so we will just take it week by week and then look at the market condition and then go from there i think the beauty is that we have the ability to do it and we have plenty of capital to do it but we also dont have to do it because our profitability is still pretty strong right now operator this concludes our questionandanswer
