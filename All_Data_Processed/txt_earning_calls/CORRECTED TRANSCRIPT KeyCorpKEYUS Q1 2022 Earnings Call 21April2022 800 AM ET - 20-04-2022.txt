this morning we reported earnings of million or per share our results reflect strong underlying operating performance expected seasonality and the impact of current market conditions our results also included per share of additional loan loss provision in excess of net chargeoffs one of the standouts this quarter was our strong loan growth average loans were up from the last quarter driven by both our consumer and commercial businesses adjusting for the planned runoff of ppp and the sale of our indirect auto business we grew loans by yearoveryear our strong loan growth benefited net interest income which came in above our expectations we also revised our net interest income outlook higher reflecting both stronger loan growth and the ongoing benefit from higher interest rates in our consumer business we continue to focus on adding and deepening client relationships and our two growth engines consumer mortgage and laurel road we originated billion in consumer mortgages in the first quarter and laurel road had a record quarter with originations of million its worth noting that our laurel road results were accomplished with the federal student loan payment holiday remaining in place the outlook for this business remains strong with a new offering for nurses the largest segment of the healthcare industry planned for may national nurses day we also experienced strong core loan growth in our commercial businesses as we grew our targeted industry verticals additionally we benefited from a increase in ci line utilization in the first quarter we raised over billion in capital for our clients retaining on our balance sheet this is a 500basispoint increase from the amount retained in as we discussed at our recent investor day this is exactly the way our business

sheet alternatives for our clients our pipelines and outlook for loan growth across our franchise remain strong which will continue to provide us with an opportunity to deploy our liquidity into higher yielding assets market conditions impacted several parts of our business this quarter fee income reflected a slowdown in capital markets activity late in the quarter which adversely impacted

longterm outlook for our investment banking business remains positive our pipelines remain strong we will also continue to add senior bankers to support our growth expense levels this quarter

chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans of basis points nonperforming loans and criticized loans also declined this quarter we continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk

return capital to our shareholders looking ahead we are encouraged by our first quarter business trends and outlook which has led us to make a number of positive revisions to our fullyear guidance these include stronger loan growth based on the pipelines we see across our company higher net interest income driven by loan growth liquidity deployment and our interest rate positioning and lastly lower net chargeoffs reflecting our strong risk profile importantly we remain confident in our ability to generate positive operating leverage again in and make continued progress against each of our longterm goals don will cover the specifics of our fullyear guidance in his comments overall despite market headwinds key delivered another solid quarter i remain confident in our future and our

officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the first quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share down from last year our results in the current quarter reflect the benefit of strong core operating performance combined with the challenge of the current market conditions our strong loan growth up keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 from last quarter resulted in betterthanexpected net interest income and positions us well for the future growth the challenging market conditions at the end of the quarter were reflected in a few areas including investment banking fees and marketrelated adjustments and other income finally the increase in our allowance this quarter reflected a qualitative adjustment to reflect the economic uncertainty given the current events with russia and ukraine absent the qualitative adjustment our provision would have approximated our net chargeoff level ill cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from a yearago period and up from the prior quarter strong loan growth continued through the first quarter commercial loans increased from last quarter line utilization rates improved this quarter increasing basis points ppp loan balances were billion on average this quarter compared to billion last year and billion last quarter our consumer business continued its strong performance as we saw residential real estate originations of billion resulting in an increase in balances of from last quarter we achieved record laurel road originations of million this quarter despite the ongoing federal student loan payment holiday yearoveryear comparisons were impacted by the sale of our indirect loan portfolio late in if we adjust for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio last year as well as the impact of ppp our core loans were up yearoveryear by approximately billion or our outlook for now reflects an increase for loan growth for the year of midsingle digits on a reported basis or midteens growth on a basis adjusted for both ppp and the sale of the indirect auto portfolio continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the first quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and down billion or from the prior quarter the current quarter change was consistent with previous seasonal trends compared to the previous year we have experienced nice growth in both commercial and consumer deposits our cost of interestbearing deposits remained unchanged at basis points we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately of our total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the first quarter compared to billion a year ago and billion for the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the first quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter both net interest income and net interest margin reflect the ppp forgiveness the current quarter reflected million of net interest income from ppp down million from the prior quarter and million from the prior year this negatively impacted net interest margin by basis points compared to the last quarter ppp is impacting key disproportionately compared to peers given the success we achieved in delivering this product to our customers offsetting this impact was the benefit from deploying some of the excess liquidity through strong loan growth we have increased our outlook to reflect the strength of our loan growth as well as the impact of higher interest rates our current rate outlook follows the forward curve and a beta assumption beginning in the highsingle digits in the second quarter and trading toward the level later in this outlook results in a highsingledigit increase in net interest income from or between and adjusting this for the impact of ppp our growth would keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 have been to also included in the appendix is additional detail on our investment portfolio and asset liability positioning moving on to slide as mentioned before our noninterest income was negatively impacted by changing market conditions late in the quarter which impacted several line items noninterest income was million for the first quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million for the fourth quarter compared to the yearago period the decrease was primarily driven by marketrelated adjustments included in other income representing about million of the yearoveryear variance this included both changes in write downs of certain holdings and reversals of derivative reserves last year the reductions in cards and payments fees are related to the lower level of prepaid card activity from the statesupported programs which is offset by a corresponding reduction to the related expense additionally during the quarter our consumer mortgage fees were lower reflecting higher balance sheet retention and lower gain on sale margins these declines were partially offset by stronger corporate services income resulting from customer derivative activities compared to the fourth quarter noninterest income decreased million primarily driven by lower investment banking and debt placement fees coming off their record level in the fourth quarter of last year marketrelated adjustments negatively impacted the quarteroverquarter variance by million as last quarter included marketrelated gains and this quarter experienced losses im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to billion last year and billion in the prior quarter compared to the yearago quarter our expenses reflect lower productionrelated incentive compensation offset by higher salaries including the impact of our direct investments into the businesses on the nonpersonnel side our other expense category reflects lower prepaid cardrelated expenses offset by higher travel and entertainment expense and fdic assessments now moving to slide overall credit quality continues to perform well for the first quarter net chargeoffs remained low and were million or basis points of average loans nonperforming loans delinquency and criticized classified levels all remained relatively stable based on this performance the quantitative level of our allowance remained flat with last quarter however we did add a qualitative adjustment to our allowance to reflect the economic uncertainty given the current events with russia and ukraine as well as potential impact of higher rates the qualitative adjustment is driven by the impact from changes in the overall economy and their potential impact on our customers as a result our provision expense exceeded our net chargeoffs by about million we have no direct exposure to russia or ukraine now on to slide we ended the first quarter with a common equity tier ratio of within our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders importantly we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities on slide is our fullyear outlook the guidance is relative to our fullyear results and ranges are shown at the bottom of the slide importantly using the midpoints of our guidance range i would support chris comments about delivering another year of positive operating leverage in average loans will be up mid keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 single digits on a reported basis excluding ppp and the impact of the sale of our indirect auto loan business average loans will be up midteens we expect average deposits to be up lowsingle digits net interest income is expected to be up highsingle digits reflecting growth in average loan balances and higher interest rates offset by lower fees from ppp forgiveness our guidance is based on the forward curve with eight additional expected rate increases this would assume a fed funds rate of by the end of on a reported basis noninterest income will be down midsingle digits reflecting the lower prepaid card revenue related to our support of government programs and our first quarter actual results we expect noninterest expense to be down lowsingle digits once again adjusting for the expected reduction in expenses related to prepaid cards expenses will be relatively stable for the year we expect net chargeoffs to be in the range of basis points to basis points given our strong credit trends we would expect loss rates to remain below the targeted range early in the year and move to modestly higher levels later in the year and our guidance for the gaap tax rate is approximately finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was a solid quarter and we remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders with that i will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the qa portion of the call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask about the loan outlook it was a nice surprise to see that increase in loans so a twopart question can you just talk about the growth dynamics between commercial and consumer and because on the consumer i would have thought some pressure just mortgage on resi mortgage with the higher rates in laurel road just given the extension of the student debt moratorium christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 sure peter so we were fortunate to have growth really on both sides both the consumer and the commercial side on the consumer side one of the things to keep in mind on our residential mortgage business is that it is a relationshipbased business also its a business thats not very mature and that we just started it really in so it has a really good trajectory as don mentioned we had a very productive quarter and frankly the application backlog is greater going into the next quarter so we feel good about that the other thing that weve done is weve built it to really focus a lot on purchase more than half of the business is directed at purchase which is obviously more durable now having said that we certainly expect like all mortgage businesses to be down in absolute terms but we will gain share on the mortgage side as it relates to laurel road obviously weve got a really great niche there and were going to continue to play that where theres million doctors and dentists in the united states and were going to expand it in early may to the million nurses and so i think thats a business youll see us be able to continue to grow now on the commercial side we obviously benefited from utilization that was up basis points so that obviously is a benefit we also are in certain areas that are just very capital intensive if you think about affordable housing and renewables both of which we are in the number two position in north america those are businesses that are repeat customers and were able to provide a lot of capital to the other thing i would share with you and i mentioned this in my remarks if you think about going from on balance sheet to on balance sheet due to some market dislocation that in and of itself on billion of capital raised is another billion or so so thats kind of on both sides whats driving it one other thing i should mention we also obviously entered the year with more bankers than we had last year which is also helpful peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks chris very helpful and then just another question just i understand under you lowered the outlook on fee income it seems to imply that most of the pain is felt in the quarter and youre looking for based on the guidance a pretty strong rebound in the second quarter and for the rest of the year could you just provide a little bit more color and maybe some guidance to what youre looking for in the second quarter christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure well we never provide specific guidance on the second quarter but just as it relates to our investment banking fees our pipelines are actually up now the realization of those pipelines obviously is somewhat marketdependent but your assumption is correct weaker first quarter than we would have expected and the rest of the year generally in line don donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah the other thing that id like to highlight there too peter is is that within that other income category we did have losses of about million this quarter compared to gains in previous two quarters whether it was year overyear or quartertoquarter and we wouldnt expect those to continue keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 and then were also expecting to see continued growth in a few of our categories weve talked about before with the wealth management asset management investment services and cards and paymentsrelated revenues as well we think will be nice additions to that growth for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of this year peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess don maybe i wanted to focus just on the size of the balance sheet we did see you mentioned seasonality in deposits but give us a sense of your outlook on deposits i think you and chris have talked about some level of consumer deposits that you think could leave the bank so whats the outlook for consumer deposits and then how do we think about the size of the balance sheet i also saw some repayment on the debt side also would appreciate any color there donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure as far as the deposits we have about billion of deposits for the first quarter with our guidance being up lowsingle digits for deposits compared to the previous year that would imply deposits remain around that same general range what were seeing is nice household growth in our retail business and we expect that to continue were also seeing growth in our core operating accounts on the commercial side where up to of our commercial deposits are our core operating account balances and so thats very important for us and so we expect that to continue to grow where we saw seasonality this quarter is that some of our state and governmentrelated deposits and also some of our escrow deposits are at seasonal highs in the fourth quarter and we do see those come down a little bit in the first quarter keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 and then we would see pressure for some of the excess balances outside those core operating accounts going forward which would be offset by the other growth that we would expect to see by growing the households and new commercial customers as far as the rest of the balance sheet our longterm debt did decline a little bit i would say that well be probably seeing a few issuances here over the next few quarters and probably especially in that tier category as were focused on continuing to support that capital with the balance sheet growth that we are seeing so we think were in good shape as far as the deposits pleased with the trajectory we have and im more pleased with the customer growth were seeing there as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so fair to assume you expect earning assets to grow from here from what we saw in donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp we would expect some growth in earning assets thats correct with the loan growth assumptions and seeing some modest growth on the liability side correct ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one quick question on the investment banking debt fees appreciate that loan growth picked up as a function of the tougher cap markets backdrop talk to us if you can just about the expense leverage in that business if it were to remain weaker for a prolonged period of time is there any specific expense offset to that that we should think about donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah ebrahim weve talked before about for the investment banking fees for the capital markets revenues overall that theres about a correlation with just the incentive compensation alone and so you saw that clearly in our numbers for this quarter our incentive comp numbers were down linkedquarter and yearover year given the production overall and so there is that variable component to the business and as chris mentioned we have been adding senior bankers and we still expect to were going to see growth opportunities going forward and so well still expect to grow that but if we see a different economic outlook we can tackle back on some of those investments if we just dont see the opportunity and return for those investments near term ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 operator thank you our next question will come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc not to beat a dead horse on the ib debt placement fees but this is where i wanted to start so if we look at this quarter your launch point is basically the same as where it was last year i think a lot of us were surprised even at the investor day that the message was you thought you could grow that over where we were in maybe can you dial us in dial on like what are you expecting for fullyear for that line item donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp well steve what we are seeing is strength in the pipelines the pipelines are up yearoveryear were seeing activities still going forward as far as the first quarter on march we were thinking in ibd fees would have been about million higher than where they actually came in at and so we saw a number of transactions basically pushed and so were seeing some of those close here in the second quarter but our outlook would essentially be that based on the pipelines were going to see it recovered to where we would have expected going into the year for the second through fourth quarter but i dont want to make a commitment thats going to be up yearoveryear some of thats based on the market volatility that were seeing and seeing whats going to happen from this point forward but we are expecting to see a significant pickup from the first quarter levels for the rest of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i mean do you think you can hold it flat on where you were last year is that a stretch goal at this point donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp steve i think what weve got here really is showing strong growth in our revenue outlook the fee income category were showing moved down as far as our outlook for this year which implies basically the january guidance adjusted for the actual results in the first quarter keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 so thats not assuming that we make the recovery of that shortfall in the first quarter but we think we will show strong growth from here and excited about the pipelines and the prospects from this point forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay thats helpful and then i wanted to follow up on ebrahims question on deposits i was actually surprised you kept the deposit guidance i mean what were hearing from other banks is that businesses are finally starting to use deposits to invest in their business and we know the feds now about to embark on qt and this is probably even more important than nim when we think about nii for could you drill down further why youre not expecting deposit balances to fall as just liquidity comes out of the system overall christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp steve we spent a lot of time when we were really we had so much liquidity we spent a lot of time really focusing on what commercial deposits we wanted and as don mentioned in his comments of our commercial deposits are operating accounts and so thats probably a pretty good place from which to start so having said that theres no question that commercial deposits will have a higher beta than consumer deposits and we will see how it plays out but we feel pretty good about our assumptions with respect to betas and also the composition of our commercial deposits steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay but chris i hear you on the being operating accounts but when you drill down to the account level dont you find operating accounts are inflated where they were from even a year or two years ago like i think theres some risk that operating account balances contract as well as the fed moves forward to qt christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp i do think there is a risk particularly if interest rates start moving up at basis points at a crack actually in our balance sheet the more elevated deposits are really on the consumer side at this point steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and if i could squeeze one more in don the nii guidance is that the current forward curve is that what youre assuming donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thats correct its up additional rate moves and or basis point increases there might be some in there that we would expect and it gets to a fed funds rate of by the end of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thanks steven operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just a question on the expense side so it sounds like you did you do expect potentially somewhat lower capital markets revenue for the fullyear despite the recovery and you lowered your overall ph nii guidance partly also reflected in the first quarter but you kept your expense range for the year does that reflect some of the better loan production or is it just a function of the range thanks donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah there is some of the range there i would say that keep in mind too the impact for the first quarter wasnt all ibd fees some of it was the market valuation adjustments and there really isnt any ic attached to that we dont pay on those revenues to any of our business units and so there isnt that correlation so only a portion of that was the timing within the ibd fees and so if you look at our outlook for expenses going forward there is an increase assumed there for the second through fourth quarter compared to the first quarter levels and thats reflective of the increase to revenue that were expecting throughout the capital markets areas christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp and john the only thing i would add to that is we will continue to invest in our business and so that too were obviously always taking expenses out but at the same point were making investments john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks chris and then on the loan growth side the increased loan growth guidance up to the mid teens level now could you just possibly unpack that a bit in terms of how you think that growth could break down by ci cre which also saw some pretty good growth in consumer thanks keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah the cre growth that youre seeing really is because of the affordable housing that were seeing come through and so we are seeing growth there i would say that as far as the prospective growth its really reflective of what weve seen over the last three quarters each of the last three quarters weve grown our average loans about from the previous quarter and annualized about clip i would say that in the third and fourth quarter of last year it was more focused on the consumer we did get benefit this quarter from commercial with the utilization rates picking up basis points and so that also grew at a clip going forward we think that split will remain fairly consistent both commercial and consumer showing about growth rates to end up being at midsingledigit kind of or middoubledigit growth adjusted for ppp and indirect auto john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks don if i could just ask one more do you have what your new money loan yields are for your new loan production that youre putting on i dont know if you have to break that out by bucket im just curious because i know you made a point to mention that youre seeing a loan growth opportunity to actively put liquidity to work in higheryielding areas thanks donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah the liquidity to work in higher yielding areas is in the loan growth and what were seeing on the commercial side as spreads are still a little tighter today than what they were a year ago but were seeing a decent pickup there compared to what were yielding on cash or the shortterm investments we have in the portfolio as far as laurel road we target a price spread to the cost of funds for that type of asset duration of about basis points to basis points and so if that were a fixed rate loan at an average life of four years you would have something in the type of handle for the yield there and with the residential mortgages were seeing a nice mix of arms and 15year product we do have some 30year jumbos but those are declining and those will be consistent with what you would see in the jumbo rate market going forward so thats just a little bit of flavor as far as the spreads john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right thanks don donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi don christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp hey good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris and don can you guys elaborate on the positive operating leverage outlook youre talking about its going to continue to be positive but if the world changes from where we are today what are some of the levers that you guys have on the shelf to be able to use to make sure that you do achieve your positive operating leverage goals christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure so the first thing is we have several businesses that are really variable cost businesses so gerard thats a huge advantage that is why you see our expenses on a linkedquarter basis theyre down million linked quarter the other levers that we have is were always focused on continuous improvement and every place we can and this is not new weve been talking about this for some time we are replacing clumsy handoffs with software front middle and back office and those continue to provide benefits other areas where we focused last year for example we had some kind of untime things we contributed for example to our foundation in a large way so we had some onetime things last year and then the other thing that i think is a huge opportunity for us on the expense side is just real estate i mean the world has changed dramatically since prepandemic and we like a lot of people as leases come up i think weve used the number of of our nonbranch nonops real estate i think its probably even higher than that so those are a few things that we have going for us levers that we can and will pull if required gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then it looked like from the average balance sheet you have about billion or so in available forsale securities can you share us your thinking on are they all going to remain in that category i know you dont have to take any aoc marks aoci marks through your cet1 ratio since youre not an advanced approach bank but can you just share with us what youre thinking on whether some should be moved into held to maturity and then what was the aoci mark in the quarter if you have that donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 sure one on the billion in afs keep in mind that about billion of that is in shortterm treasuries and so we bought those throughout last year and had a life of two to three years and so well see that burn off over time another 2plusbillion is in the securities we had from the indirect auto securitization transaction and so we will well see that again wind down over time and so the majority of the growth that you would have seen in that category compared to a year ago was from those two areas and so it was fairly stable absent those two changes with that we continue to evaluate whether or not we should have new purchases going into heldtomaturity versus afs well continue to reevaluate that but economically its not much different for us as far as where it sits there is an accounting implication to it and were seeing the impact of that through the aoci that its up over billion linkedquarter and its driven by both the marks on the investment portfolio as well as the swap book and compared to our peers we have a higher percentage of assets in that category or those categories and that really reflects the impact of our balance sheet overall our loans are about floaters and fixed compared to most peers are at and for whatever reason the loans dont get marktomarket and but the investment securities and the swaps do and so it comes through a little bit disproportionate for us as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and don just on the duration you said that the new investments are coming in around two maybe three years if i heard you correctly and whats the overall duration of the portfolio donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp i apologize gerard the shortterm treasuries had a yield of a maturity of two to three years the overall duration of the portfolio now is close to five years and it would typically be buying cmo structures that are in that range and we do buy some 15year passthroughs there but that would also be around that same type of duration and if we look at the yield on those new purchases going forward its currently in that to range itll be a nice pickup compared to the yield that were seeing on the runoff of the existing portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you for the insights appreciate it donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc chris i just wanted to ask you this directly because the stock is indicating down premarket a lot of analysts have asked you this in different ways already but should core fee income like investment banking should the pipeline not materialize as much as its indicating is your commitment to positive operating leverage strong enough that you will adjust expenses in order to achieve that even if the core fee income outlook gets worse christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp thats correct were committed to having positive operating leverage and as i was just sharing with gerard we have a lot of levers that we can pull including we could cease to make some of the investments were making we dont see that as the base case but thats obviously an option that we have erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for don don a few followups on how we should think about the balance sheet as we think about a rising rate environment number one to ebrahims question on earning asset growth should we assume that earning asset growth should be about equivalent to that deposit growth that you are forecasting for the year second cash end of period looks like its now under billion have we reached the bottom in terms of absolute cash levels and third im wondering if you could give us an update on the value of each basis points to the nim and im guessing that obviously the value would be greater in the first ph million versus the next million given deposit betas donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp its a loaded question there ill try to take care of those erika in order here but as far as the average balance sheet growth yearoveryear i think that lowsingle digits or about growth is appropriate i would say that the incremental growth from here probably is lower than that that would be implying that our deposit balances are relatively stable and we will have some growth in some of our debt but not a lot as far as the cash position that what weve talked about before is that cash plus that shortterm treasury position is really a view of our excess liquidity and so that was about billion at yearend and its about billion on a combined basis here at the end of the first quarter we do see that cash position coming down from that billion we typically run that in the billion to billion range and so we would expect to see that come down but not dramatically from where it is today keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 and then as far as the impact for net interest income for a 25basispoint increase in rates across the board it would be upper million range as far as the nii impact as far as the nim impact id have to go back and work through the math on that but it would be based on that same upper million range we are forecasting that over the next early rate increases deposit betas will be low and as we mentioned in the speaker notes that second quarter we would expect deposit betas to be in the uppersingledigit range and then transitioning into the range in the second half of the year so we would expect to start to see that deposit beta pick up as you would see rates go up that 100basispointplus range compared to where we started the year erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i think sorry to add a third question but don your peers are thinking for the next i guess to i guess its pretty much in line do you think that is a conservative forecast or its about appropriate relative to what youre seeing i thought the of your commercial deposits being operating was a very strong statistic donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah i would say that compared to where we were before that is a strong number and is reflective of what we are expecting for that commercial performance given that strong operating account level and many of our commercial deposits are contractually set as far as how they reprice based on changes in rates we do think there could be some upside but we think its a reasonable forecast given the pace of rate increases and what were starting to hear or speculate as far as the market change overall erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi not to miss the forest for the trees but you can confirm these numbers but going back to the base case first quarter operating leverage negative your guidance using midpoints up so youre saying youre going to come from behind kind of like the cleveland cavaliers in the nba final right and if you dont then you wont meet those expectations and im not sure you have a lebron so in very simple terms how do you go down by percentage points to up by the end of the year keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp a couple things on that mike first quarter we would have expected to see some decline in our operating leverage compared to the year ago first quarter that we knew that we had some gains in the first quarter of last year in that other income category and so we thought we would see some pressure there so our initial outlook would have suggested a positive operating leverage without the changes that we just made and to your point mike we are forecasting a better ppnr and therefore better operating leverage number for us with this outlook including the rate changes in our balance sheet growth than what we had before so we think thats a real positive and i think that to your point and what chris had answered before i think some of the strength in the model and why we have confidence in our ability to achieve that positive operating leverage is many of our growth categories are highly variable and so if the growth doesnt come through well see the cost come down because it doesnt come through there and so we feel confident in our ability and i think weve got lebrons running around here trying to deliver our business and have success so were optimistic about where were going forward mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and i did the math right so youre basically guiding for up revenues and down expenses donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thats correct mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc if you use the midpoint donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp the midpoint of the guidance range is thats correct yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just separately i mean netflix was in the news because subscriber growth went down or something and i guess if you measured your own subscriber growth i dont know is customer growth is it up and how much is it up and how much do you measure that clearly gaining wallet share with greater loan utilization so i get that but how much are you growing customers say in laurel road or elsewhere christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure mike and as you know on investor day we made some commitments and well be reporting on those twice a year so well report on it for the first time this fall but i can tell you to use your analogy we are growing subscribers in our retail business which is really household relationships we clearly are growing subscribers as it keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 relates to laurel road it was a record quarter both in terms of funded volume and number of new households and the other equivalent that obviously well be talking about is just the number of bankers that we have out on the street that then translates into subscribers as theyre out calling on people mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so how many new households at laurel road this past quarter or yearoveryear if you disclose it christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp were not disclosing it until september and then mike what well do is well roll forward i can tell you that its up and then well actually report on it twice a year well report in september mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was looking at the slide on the alco position and i know earlier you spoke about this with gerard as it relates to the quarter i just wanted to understand how the changes that youve made in the alco book are likely to impact not only nii over the rest of this year and into next but also the aoci because it looks like youve done keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 some stuff to try to protect against aoci risk in and i raise it because obviously we all know the years backed up since march 31st so some color there would be helpful thanks donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure can as far as what weve done we have shown some of our asset sensitivity come down a little bit and thats just based on some of the positioning that we did throughout the quarter one of the things i think is unique for us thats helping us position the balance sheet and helping us position our earnings overall is that we had about billion of cmbs agency securities in the portfolio where we did a forward starting swap for those that actually converted those to floating we actually wound down about billion of those swaps in the first quarter and well unwind another billion in the second quarter with those unwinds it really converts that floating component to fix and adds an additional basis points in yields thats billion over the remaining life of the securities and so we think that will be a nice lift up for us going forward on the overall swap position it was fairly stable for the core cash flow swaps we use for assetliability purposes and well continue to reassess that and well start to think about how we can manage that position overall as far as the rate changes since quarterend thats where weve been able to take advantage of that with some of these starting forward starting swaps like i mentioned and well start to see some of that help the position overall going forward as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so based on the backup and long end that weve had since march how much less impact would you say youd be exposed to if this rate is what prints on june relative to what we experienced in donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp betsy i dont have that exact math right now but we can go through that and let you know but i would say that our rate position and our outlook for nii going forward would not be changed from reflecting the current rates and current curve today compared to what it would have been as of march betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just other question i had is on funding the loan growth that youre looking for in the rest of this year it seems like in this quarter there was a partial funding from deposits partial funding from cash and im just wondering if im thinking about the rest of the year given that youre looking for deposit growth to slow and really as you mentioned earlier be flat here from here on how are you thinking about funding that loan growth is it drawing down more on cash or is it more drawing down on securities or just the cash flow from the securities book would be helpful thanks donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 sure you hit on all the levers that were looking at essentially that we would see that cash position come down a little bit from where it is i would say that the bond portfolio puts out about billion to billion a quarter of cash flow just from maturities and as i mentioned earlier in the call we would expect to have some debt issuances through the second and fourth quarters of this year to help reset that and so all of those combined will be used to help fund some of that future growth and are reflected in our forecast betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning don just one more followup on the balance sheet so your rate sensitivity the forward starting swaps i guess do we know how much is still yet to start and how much would those forward starting change that sensitivity if at all donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp well the forward starting that we didnt close out by the end of the first quarter was billion and then the other component i think weve got about an additional billion that are forward starting that will start later in the year that will that are already reflected in that but will be fully phased in by the end of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay and then just is this your comfort zone with where you want the asset sensitivity sit in that zone i know you brought it down a little bit but do you anticipate either adding more or changing the other complexities of what youre adding on the fixed rate side to change that at all from here donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp we could see that continue to trend down a little bit we tend to be focused on about a plus or minus range and depending upon what were seeing for our expectation for rates versus what the market would have i think you could see that close down a little bit but not a lot from that level ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay so were pretty much looking at like what the balance sheet should look like aside from the growth dynamics that youve talked through keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp you will see the impact of the growth dynamics correct but not seeing material changes from here as far as the overall balance sheet correct ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay great thanks don donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning you had a lot of growth in commercial real estate this quarter and really over the past year or so and you mentioned is coming from affordable housing maybe just remind us like what type of loans those are just the risk dynamics of it and if theres some sort of like government backing or encouraging or how those are appealing christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp matt its chris these loans are what you would typically see kind of in a multifamily environment the affordable feature of it changes a little bit some of the economics but actually the lending parameters dont change theres not a backstop per se but as you know we have dramatically derisked our real estate book over the years we have very very little construction at one point i think we had going into the global financial crisis i think we had like in terms of construction today that is a highsingle digit so its a very solid book with solid developers that we know and its as weve mentioned before its a huge unmet need that will i believe will continue to be funded matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then somewhat maybe related or unrelated the corporate service income line are there whats the key driver there that was very strong are there loan fees in there or whats the key drivers there donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp there were some loan fees there but more of it matt was in derivative production that we saw in the quarter and have seen over the last couple quarters going forward on that category matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 okay thanks thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian foran with autonomous please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hey good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp don or i guess don and chris on slide you show the cet1 on top and the tce on the bottom and don you made a bunch of great points about the funkiness of the aoci concept its very logical and very consistent with what we hear from other banks so i want to acknowledge that but as you think about capital this cycle clearly cet1 is the main one is the tce matter at all is there any level of tce that would make that a limiting factor or is tce just kind of not relevant to the cycle because its about rates not credit donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thats a great question brian i would say that our as you suggested our primary focus is on common equity tier ratio and so thats the one that were managing to and using and so thats our focus as we look at our capital priorities as far as supporting that organic growth making sure we maintain that strong dividend and using share buybacks to manage within that range the tce ratio is clearly impacted because of the dramatic change we saw in rates what helps us in that side is is that as i mentioned before between those shortterm treasuries in the swap book a third of that aoci adjustment actually goes away in the next years and so well see that burn in fairly quickly and so that will help us in deciding whats the appropriate level of tce we do watch that we do pay attention to it we do have some goals and objectives there as far as we dont want to see it drop below certain levels but were still above that threshold and it hasnt required us to make any additional changes to how were managing our capital or overall balance sheet brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp great thank you donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question i think kind of asked and answered but don maybe ill take you back one that hopefully is fairly straightforward and just other fee income so you had the marketrelated adjustments so that led to the loss of million or so versus a typical number kind of in that million to million range with the losses kind of behind you does that reverse straight back up to or would that necessitate some sort of recovery in that in other words does it split the difference with no change in market dynamics how should that all flow through donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp typically before last year we would have seen something in the sort of for that category so its more of a split the difference there like you said scott and that would be our expectation going forward r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right i think that does it so thank you very much donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you and we do have a followup question from gerard cassidy please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you lebron i mean don can you touch upon chris comments i think in his opening remarks he talked about the student loan holiday have you guys kind of trying to dig into your customer base about the potential that once the holiday ends or the deferments and how much refinancing business is sitting there for you guys to capture christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp yeah gerard its chris we clearly think theres a backlog weve seen it before just when people thought the holiday was ending that weve seen rampups so im sure there are people out there that logically have deferred and if and when it were to end i think theres some pentup demand weve seen that play out with sort of the couple of deadlines that have been out there and have been extended gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc keycorp key corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2022 and chris is it more for the existing customer base or is it just the general pool of medical school debt thats out there that you guys would try to go after christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp no we would go after the entire pool of medical school debt so theres the medical school debt that is thats with the government and theres also the refinance debt gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator thank you there are no further questions in the queue at this time ill pass it back to chris for any closing remarks christopher m gorman
