share repurchase program providing additional flexibility to effectively manage capital and benefit our shareholders fnb reported first quarter gaap earnings per share of and on an operating basis

benefit from the current interest rate cycle these include favorable deposit mix changes in investing in a shortterm securities portfolio we remain well positioned with billion of assets that are tied to shortterm rates in this year loans increased billion or when excluding ppp while howard contributed to the growth commercial loan production was more than a billion up year over year as we look ahead pipelines have rebuilt from fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 our strong growth in the fourth quarter and are up quarteroverquarter this gives us

quarter wealth management continued to produce record results with revenues increasing million linkedquarter or nearly annualized driven primarily by record organic sales activity mortgage banking income increased linkedquarter to million with significant interest rate volatility while rising mortgage rates are expected to reduce refinance activity we are confident our diversified geographic footprint and consistent commitment to the home purchase and new construction market will help us outperform the industry in fact nearly of our originations this quarter were for purchased money mortgages fnbs investment in technology has also enabled us to efficiently bring in more mortgage clients with of our mortgage applications submitted through our online estore as we continue to grow our balance sheet we remain vigilant in examining the current macroeconomic environment of high inflation supply chain disruptions and geopolitical unrest we have proactively assessed the risks and activated plans given the current environment our credit team is continually monitoring the industries that are potentially affected by the rising interest rates higher food oil and gas and commodity prices and supply chain disruption we will continue to assess the environmental risks and adjust our strategy appropriately to ensure consistent performance while addressing the needs of our key stakeholders i will now turn the call over to gary to discuss overall credit performance and the steps his team has taken to position our portfolio gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone our first quarter results remained strong and we are very pleased with the continued favorable positioning of our credit portfolio as evidenced by our key asset quality metrics the quarter also marked the successful completion of the howard bank acquisition which i am pleased to report came over slightly better than expected and did not have a material impact to the overall credit portfolio i will provide some additional color on the transaction including the day one and day two impacts to the reserve levels which i will touch on later in my prepared remarks lets first review our gaap asset quality results for the quarter as i have mentioned previously we entered with our credit portfolio in a position of strength and with the newly acquired howard loan book now reflected in our total consolidated results we saw only slight increases in our delinquency and npl levels as compared to our very low yearend results the level of delinquency ended march at a very solid basis points reflecting an increase of bps driven entirely by howard and exclusive of that acquired book of loans delinquency would have decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter npls and oreo also reflected a small increase on a linkedquarter basis against very low yearend results with the gaap level up basis points to end march at bps which was again due to the absorption of howards portfolio net chargeoffs for the quarter were very low at million or basis points annualized as we continue to track at historically low levels over the past several quarters we recognized provision expense of million for the quarter including the million initial provision for nonpcd loans associated with the howard acquisition with the additional day pcd grossup of million our ending reserve position stands at million or of loans at quarter end acquired pcd loans were relatively low and represented just over of the howard loan book absent the howard transaction and the associated provision and grossup activity our reserve level would have been down fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 slightly compared to december which is consistent with the favorable credit quality trends weve seen our npl coverage position remains strong at regarding howards loan portfolio we are very pleased with the successful conversion of the book and the ongoing tracking and monitoring our teams continue to perform to help us better manage risk during this transition phase howards credit book performed slightly better than we were expecting leading up to the conversion with our loan risk profile and credit concentrations all remaining satisfactory we look forward to the additional lending opportunities and access to the expanded customer base within our midatlantic footprint which helps support our overall loan growth objectives and provides us with deeper opportunities for our other feebased services i would like to congratulate the team for their tireless efforts to close the transaction and expand our position in this highly desirable market i would now like to briefly touch on recent global and macroeconomic activity that we have been monitoring including the potential effect on our borrowers and the markets in which we operate with the ongoing challenges of widespread inflation elevated input costs supply chain disruptions labor shortages and geopolitical influences we are focused on these factors in our underwriting and in our credit discussions to address and mitigate these risks upfront while we have not seen any material impact to our credit portfolio at this time we remain vigilant and have tailored our credit decisioning approach to address the impact that these various factors could have on a borrowers ebitda and margin levels including the effects of fluctuating operational and supply costs as well as potential interest rate sensitivities that may lead to increased borrowing costs that said we have been very proactive in utilizing interest rate instruments to provide borrowers the option to fix their borrowing costs and reduce their sensitivity to the rising rate environment in closing we remain very pleased with the position of our portfolio and the successful acquisition of howard bank and we remain focused on the year ahead to manage our growing credit book through a potentially softer economic environment maintaining our strong credit culture stands front and center and we are wellprepared and remain proactive in our approach to quickly identify and better manage emerging risks in our loan portfolio our disciplined credit framework is built on a foundation of consistent underwriting attentive risk management and selectivity of high quality lending opportunities all of which has served us well and positions us for the year ahead i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary as vince mentioned we are very excited about the howard acquisition and the potential this deal offers to continue growing our feebased revenues as of the merger closing date loans and deposits were both billion with of deposits in noninterestbearing accounts in terms of significant items the first quarter had million in mergerrelated expenses million of initial provision for nonpcd loans and million in branch consolidation costs in conjunction with the acquisition fnb issued a little over million shares of common stock at in exchange for million shares of howard common stock going forward howard will be included in all of our reported numbers including guidance as theyre now part of fnb with that lets turn to slide to discuss the first quarter financials starting with the highlights first quarter reported eps totaled and on an operating basis after adjusting for the howardrelated items and branch consolidation costs previously noted but excluding ppp and howard loans as of the acquisition date which is more reflective of underlying loan growth period end total loans increased million or fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 annualized on a linkedquarter basis including an increase of million in commercial loans and leases and million in consumer loans average loans excluding ppp and howard increased million or annualized lets continue with the balance sheet on slide first quarter average securities reached billion an increase of million from the prior quarter as we increased our investing activity take advantage of the higher interest rate environment securities growth coupled with the loan growth contributed to a increase in total average earning assets average deposits excluding howard totaled billion an increase of yearoveryear reflecting continued organic growth in households and account balances partially offset by decline in time deposits given customer preferences to move funds into liquid accounts turning to slide net interest income totaled million an increase of million or from the prior quarter primarily due to growth in average earning assets and initial benefits from the higher interest rate environment partially offset by the million decreased contribution from ppp our net interest margin increased basis points to reflecting the early stages of benefiting from upward movement in interest rates total impact of ppp purchase accounting accretion and higher cash balances on net interest margin was a reduction of basis points for the quarter similar to the basis point reduction last quarter now lets look at noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million essentially flat in the prior quarter we have previously mentioned the strategy of investing in our diversified feebased businesses and this quarter again demonstrates its importance for example the insurance commissions and fees increase of million linkedquarter offset the capital markets decrease of million as they reverted from elevated levels in the fourth quarter we expect our diversified fee income strategy to be advantageous as we continue along the economic cycle reported noninterest expense increased million or linkedquarter on an operating basis noninterest expense increased million or to million excluding mergerrelated expenses and branch consolidation costs from the current and prior quarters on an operating basis salaries and employee benefits increased million or linkedquarter primarily related to normal seasonal long term compensation expense of million in the first quarter of as well as seasonally higher employerpaid payroll taxes also included in the quarter total is a little over two months of salaries and benefits for the howard employees that joined fnb occupancy and equipment increased million or primarily due to higher seasonal utilities cross bank shares and franchise taxes increased million due to the recognition of state tax credits in the prior quarter efficiency ratio equals compared to higher efficiency ratio resulted from nearly million of lower ppp and purchase accounting accretion income versus a year ago excluding ppp and paa our efficiency ratio would have improved around a basis points yearoveryear we expect improvement from this quarters efficiency ratio moving forward with a positive impact from expected rate hikes and synergies in revenue and expense associated with howard tangible book value per share decreased linkedquarter to primarily related to million or per share and accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on the fair value of afs securities this compares to a million or negative impact at the end of the prior quarter increased unrealized losses in the afs portfolio due to rising interest rates should come back into capital over time as securities mature or prepay fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 during the first quarter of the company repurchased million shares of common stock with a weighted average share price of for a total of million to date fnb repurchased million under the program approved in september earlier this month our board approved a new million share repurchase program continuing to provide fnb with the tools to optimize capital management and enhance overall shareholder returns now lets turn to guidance on page we expect loans to increase in the low double digits to low teens with underlying organic growth in the mid to high single digits on a yearoveryear spot basis total deposits projected to grow high single digits on a yearoveryear spot basis full year net interest income is expected to be between billion and billion with the second quarter between million and million our base guidance currently assumes basis points of rate increases for the remainder of the year including a basis point increase in may full year noninterest income is expected to be between million and million with the second quarter around million the revised full year guidance is due to slightly lower than expected market related fee income there is no change to our full year guidance for noninterest expense in the range of million to million on an operating basis for the full year and million to million for the second quarter this does not include the onetime expenses associated with the howard bank acquisition positive credit quality is expected to continue throughout with provision guidance to million to million this does not include the initial million of provisions related to howard and is dependent on net loan growth experienced throughout the year lastly the effective tax rate should be between and a full year which assumes no changes to corporate income tax rates and is dependent on the level of investment tax credit activity with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president

transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 momentum throughout as always our performance is a testament to our team and i thank each employee for their dedication and contribution with that ill turn the call over to the operator for questions question and answer section operator yes thank you at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time well pause momentarily to assemble the roster and the first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co in terms of vince you mentioned still lot of confidence in the loan growth expectations for the year and i think you said that the current pipeline is up linkedquarter and so i just want to followup on that and is that the commercial pipeline and i wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that pickup does it reflect supply chain issues improving is it more seasonal just wondering if you can frame a little further that significant pickup in the pipeline linkedquarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can address that i think its pretty broadbased if you look at the dispersion of our pipeline we have a little chart here for our own sake that shows the trending you can see almost every region in the company has seen growth in their pipeline on a linkedquarter basis if you remember back in the fourth quarter we had a pretty strong record production quarter for us so typically what happens the bankers are busy closing transactions the pipeline kind of shrinks a little bit and then we start to move back into prospecting or accommodating borrowers requests and the pipeline builds again i think youre seeing that here the other factor is the first quarter is seasonally slower you dont have the financial results from your corporate borrowers to act upon typically the companies havent devised their capex plans until now so now is the time when you start to see a pickup in the pipeline were very pleased with the growth in the midatlantic region mid atlantic is up yearoveryear quarteroverquarter so weve got a big boost because of that howard acquisition a lot of critical mass and scale deeper penetration in the market and some great bankers that we picked who seem to be pretty happy with our system so were very excited about the opportunities there we also feel that as i mentioned on the call from a noninterest income perspective we fee based businesses that we have we have a tremendous opportunity to penetrate that customer base with some sizeable fee opportunities and wealth and capital markets so i think that should help us in that market so thats a big driver charlottes up yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis so theres theres quite a bit going on in the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 southeast i just spent some time spent a week in charleston and raleigh and both of those markets are performing very well spent a lot of time with clients and i think our brand is being received well in those markets were pretty well established we have regional headquarters that weve established in greensboro in charlotte in raleigh and charleston south carolina with highly visible signage and a decent delivery channel so things are starting to cook there and weve expanded from a de novo perspective into asheville north carolina its been a couple of years now so thats starting to pick up for us as well as greenville south carolina we were on the outskirts of greenville but we have a plan to move into that market more heavily which provides quite a few commercial opportunities for us particularly ci opportunities and then small business banking for us historically has lagged from a growth perspective because were consolidating portfolios every time we did an acquisition that stabilized and has actually started to grow nicely for us across the footprint so were seeing a little bit of lift from our small business lending activity so that kind of gives you the landscape i think its more related frank to when you look at line utilization rates within the company chris jen and i were just looking at that data what you see is a substantial drop off in utilization so borrowings declined postpandemic beginning of the pandemic after the first quarter of the pandemic in things really fell off from a borrowing perspective for commercial borrowers so a lot of those businesses went to cash they got stimulus or benefited from stimulus and drove down their balances and then a series of things occurred which were unpredictable but supply chain disruption all kinds of things happened that kind of slowed their ability to grow or expand and i think were starting to see a pickup if you dive into that utilization rate even though we havent seen much of a global rise in utilization rates across all the portfolios when you start to drill down into it were seeing growth in the middle market now were starting to see things pick up so thats telling me that yeah you know were working through those supply chain issues companies while the wars in ukraine is probably a worry i think companies are starting to get back to normal from an operations perspective anyway thats were still we still are very cautious as ive said in my remarks were still watching whats going on from a credit perspective because there are concerns right now about additional supply chain disruptions the price of oil and gas rising and impacting certain industries so we keep a close eye on it but allin were seeing we havent seen any significant weakness anywhere in the portfolio in fact the credit quality is holding in there hope that answers your question i just tried to be as comprehensive as possible frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co yeah yeah that was helpful thank you and i guess just as a followup in terms of just given how strong just given your confidence on the loan growth picture is there any room to ramp up the buyback at all just wondering if with bank stocks having pulled back a little bit from where you bought back stock in the first quarter if we should think about that maybe ramping up a bit if we should think about stocks any differently than we did going into vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think our guidance on loan growth isnt crazy i mean were mid to high single digit growth so there is some room like for us to fund that growth with capital that we generate internally plus buy back shares and thats why the board approved the buyback program we want to have options so that we continue to drive shareholder value and kind of support the stock price if we see movement downward and the company has performed admirably over the last few years so theres a lot of confidence in the board in putting forward a buyback program fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 if you look at the financial performance of the company its been very strong indiscernible challenging times and the actions that gary and the credit team have taken and our commercial bankers i mean we really prepared ourselves well and gotten through in pretty good shape so that gives them a lot of confidence on the buyback and if you look at the capital ratios i cant remember chris we were at i think christopher chan a senior vice president director of corporate strategy and development fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania anyway from a regulatory capital perspective we look good i think were in a good place frank so there are options for us frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great thank you vince vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from michael young with truist securities please go ahead mr young your line is live vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania it sounds like hes on a horse operator all right well moving on next question will come from daniel tamayo with raymond james daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey there how are you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc doing well thank you let me first on the mortgage banking outlook you gave some good color on continuing to expect that to be i should say outperform the industry going forward but maybe if you could provide a little more detail on how youre thinking about how we should be thinking about sizing that revenue stream going forward are you still expecting that to increase from here or flat or how from a from an overall perspective do you see revenue trending from here vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well ill let vince answer that question vince calabrese but before he does i will tell you this the frontline has shifted as weve indicated we are very wellpositioned across the southeast and the midatlantic in some fairly dynamic housing markets so we have an opportunity to benefit more heavily from purchase money mortgage originations and i think our current pipeline is sitting around so we purchased money so we did make that shift which provides some support which is why i indicated in my prepared comments that we should outperform this industry were not as dependent on refinance activity and we are spread across the broad geography its a very attractive market and about of the franchise sits in very stable more stable markets which gives us some stability and were able to maintain a lower growth trajectory and then half of it sits in more dynamic higher growth markets were seeing more housing starts and a lot of activity but go ahead vince i dont know if you want to give them a little bit more color on the top line and what were our expectations vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no i would say for the quarter you saw the results they were up a little bit from kind of a low last quarter we were thinking it was going to be the low the purchase versus refi mix as vince mentioned positions us well to focus on purchase there for the quarter it was and now its up to the refi indiscernible down to of the total so kind of the way our business is built is very well positioned and the activity on the purchase side has still been very strong but i guess if you boil it down to the mortgage banking income right thats a function of how much you sell and how much indiscernible portfolio too depending on the nature of the originations weve definitely seen some shift to customers wanting to get ph arms 7year months its not one anymore and 10year and months so weve seen some movement towards that so thats up close in the portfolio so you have more portfolio higher net interest income a little bit less gain on sale on that i guess if you kind of boil it all down i would expect mortgage banking income to move up from here from the first quarter were entering the seasonal second and third quarters that are kind of high but kind of around a level to a little bit higher from here would be the best way to characterize it and its really going to be a function of the mix of those originations but theyre still very healthy applications are very strong and i think that the purchase market continues to be strong so that helps to support the business activity there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the other side of it too is theres quite a bit of activity in the consumer lending area relative to mortgage lending so outside of the mortgage bank itself we have a surge in pipelines i dont know gary indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania we have one of the strongest pipelines weve ever had right now vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so theres been a significant pickup there was a lot of pentup demand i dont know if there was the capacity to execute a lot of the construction projects so i think weve seen a surge in demand across our footprint and i think it is pretty much every geography indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so all of that leads to the reason i brought that up is because ultimately that may lead people take out a consumer loan secure it by real estate and then they roll it into a larger mortgage loan and its taken out anyway theres quite a bit of activity so were feeling pretty good about being positioned along with the purchase money opportunities and the growth in certain segments of our business geography daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats terrific color i appreciate all of that and maybe switching gears here thinking about net interest income obviously were in a much different rate outlook environment now than we were last quarter and youve updated guidance to reflect that how should we think about or how are you thinking about the change in the banks sensitivity to rates from the hike we just had all the way out to what youre forecasting by the end of the year is there any impact are you expecting any difference in terms of loan betas like what youre able to reprice on the loan side and then just remind us if youre still thinking that deposit betas end up around the to range by the end of the year thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a few things as far as whats baked into the guidance you see what we have in there an additional basis points with basis points in may we get more than that obviously theres upside to the range there so and i know everybodys modeling it with their interest rate projections so clearly theres some upside to the range depending on where we end up as far as the betas i mean the loan betas continue to be pretty strong as you know from the past i mean we have close to of total loans that are tied to libor sofr three months or less on those two measures as well as prime so billion of total loans so that benefits as rates move up the cash position we have is benefiting while we still have around billion billion that was earning now its earning and then we would expect that to move up at the time that the fed moves so that would move up another basis points to get so thats helping while that cash is not yet deployed in loans youre getting a benefit there too and then the investment portfolio weve been able to take advantage of the higher rates in recent quarter to put some more money to work there and youll see that in the growth of the investment portfolio so thats kind of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 supporting the overall margin and ppp is almost gone so if you kind of put ppp on the side loan yields were actually up basis points kind of the continuing business is there and then on the deposit beta side theres again none of us really know indiscernible level liquidity in the banking system obviously still a consideration for all of us we do think well feel more pressure as we continue to move down this path the fed moves with kind of commercial municipal deposit rates being earlier in that process our comp projection for us based on what we see and what we think would be indiscernible rate hikes coming through in total cost of deposit so kind of on a total deposit basis and around for interestbearing deposits at the end of the year thats kind of our current projections daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific thats all i had thanks for all of that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you operator thank you and the next question is indiscernible from michael young with truist please go ahead mr young your line is live michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey can you hear me vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we can now michael young q analyst truist securities inc hello okay sorry about that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay michael young q analyst truist securities inc having some technical issues here this morning i apologize vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania it sounded like you were trotting around on a horse the first time we just had a clicking noise but im glad to have you on the call fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 michael young q analyst truist securities inc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes michael young q analyst truist securities inc maybe its the ghost of cell phone past i dont know i apologize vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania it always happens indiscernible go ahead michael young q analyst truist securities inc at any rate just maybe vince wanted to walk through kind of the fee income side obviously kind of a lot of big swings this quarter with kind of the msr fair value adjustment you kind of have big moves in insurance to the upside but capital markets to the downside it sounds like a slight weakening as kind of the outlook but is that more mortgagedriven or are you seeing some things in some of the other business lines that you think will be a little weaker as we move throughout the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its a combination of several areas indiscernible i think the mortgage banking fee income in general yearoveryear is going to be challenging to meet last years fee income obviously because it was so strong but the way weve tried to build out our feebased businesses is to ensure that when ones not performing at the highest level we have enough balance within our offering to kind of make up for it and the guide that we gave you implies some of that shifting as you mentioned so capital markets we serve from a pure derivative perspective interest rate hedging obviously a lot of customers clients took advantage of the hedging products during a time when rates were extraordinarily low so that business has come down a little bit but on the flip side in capital markets we launched our debt capital markets platform so were seeing good activity there and good prospects there so were expecting to have a pretty decent year in that space we have invested in our international banking platform and added products were expecting to see some growth there weve had some really solid growth in sba we expect that to continue so our sba platform that we shrunk and then rebuilt and integrated into our integrated more indepthly into our calling activities across the company versus being a standalone business is starting to take off so those things should counterbalance fully the mortgage and derivative business thats and then wealth wealth obviously of course we rely on net asset values as well right i mean if the market remains steady we should be able to benefit there as well because were seeing a lot of organic growth were very opportunistic in dc and baltimore with that howard portfolio and the fact that they didnt have a product offering were starting to see some good opportunities there and in the in the carolinas so charleston fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 asheville greenville are all great markets for us from a private banking and wealth perspective and were starting to see some activity vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania but howard will be additive just across the base vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah yeah yes youve added quite a few households nice little commercial bank that fit in well culturally with us that people there did a nice job and we were able to take cost out but still keep the vast majority of the frontline people so weve added to our teams and those folks are doing really well vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah they didnt have the same product set that we have today the opportunity there on the fee side is significant given the quality of the customer base that howard has really across the board wealth management cap markets insurance mortgage so theres opportunities across the different feebased revenue categories thatll be additive vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so while there are challenges i cant were not trying to hedge it theres its going to be tougher in mortgage banking this year its going to be tougher in capital markets particularly centered around hedging but i think the guide that we gave you and we feel confident about because of our ability to drive fee income in those other areas vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think thats important too right so this quarter million our guide for next quarter is around million and then million to million so obviously we feel with diversity diversification within the fee based categories that were comfortable with those guidance range that we gave out so which is higher than first quarter level michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great just following up on the prior questions just as we look at kind of the cash balances the 10year rate moved up pretty considerably are you guys thinking about kind of laddering some of that out into securities and growing the size of the balance sheet or are you opting more for kind of remix than just funding loan growth with the cash so we should expect a little less balance sheet growth but higher margins vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah given the opportunities with rates i mean we definitely put some more money to work during the first quarter we invested million into the portfolio which is about million higher than cash flows and when you look at that the average balance was up almost a billion so we take advantage of rates moving but we fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 still stayed within our strategy of duration around kind of to we havent wanted to go long to date and as we sit here right now for the for the current quarter at least our anticipation would be to kind of reinvest the cash flows that are coming on and the rates are i mean we were in the fourth quarter we were investing around million first quarter was up to million again with the duration and i think one of the things thats important for us too is with the movement in interest rates i mean our securities portfolio is afs versus health and maturity so and its on a short side so i think the aoci hit that we had was much smaller than others depending on how they shop with their portfolio so that helps us manage as far as that impact to our kind of book equity but also helps us manage and create opportunities with billion worth of cash flow coming the rates continue to move well be opportunistic yeah that makes sense we will grow the portfolio some with good amount here but well just monitor very closely and look for those opportunities as we have been doing michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jerry my first question i guess just following up on the nii guidance and looking at the guide this quarter versus last quarter last quarter was fairly similar with expectation for two rate hikes and i think sensitivity if there was a third rate hike now going to five rate hikes with one that already occurred and expectation for basis points in may im a little surprised that the guidance wasnt higher is there anything else that kind of changed in the calculation of that guidance that offset some of that sensitivity to the incremental rate hikes or maybe the kind of the combination with howard i guess if you can frame that that would be great vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say one place that we are conservative is on the betas because like we really dont know whats going to happen there with howard coming on board and just kind of looking ahead from here well see well see what happens theres still like i said a lot of liquidity in the banking system so i think banks are going to be methodical about moving rates up as you need to but theres a lot of cash on their balance sheet so i mean thats one area where were probably being a little conservative on the betas but nobody really knows for certain our we moved the guide up quite a bit from the guide that was in the first quarter and given what we have in here i know some analysts have more rate hikes baked into their forecast so as i said earlier if we get more than basis points from here which the futures market indiscernible its higher than that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania higher than that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 higher than that so if you get more theres more upside there too so i mean thats those are the two things i would comment on timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as far as power goes maybe for gary just an outlook for purchaseaccounting dollars starting here in the second quarter go ahead vince im sorry vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i wasnt sure about the question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc just the expectation and outlook for accretion purchaseaccounting accretion vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay hey you want to comment vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania go ahead yeah the net accretable discount overall was only around million once you do the pcd gross up so maybe its up to maybe or a little more than a million a quarter going forward subject to pre pay timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats just for howard vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania for howard yeah timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey gary do you have any other color on howard and for the group gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can update everyone the as i mentioned in the remarks the portfolio came over better than expected we were very pleased with the information that we gathered as we got deeper deeper into the transaction around some clients that we had some missing information on up front and we were able to get very comfortable with some of those clients and move those ratings upward to pass ratings that helped tremendously from the market perspective as well as how the portfolio performed through the quarter the portfolio was very nicely underwritten it was actually the best underwritten portfolio that weve seen and we expect it to continue to fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 perform very very nicely as we move forward as you saw in the metrics the changes in the metrics were very minimal generally speaking you know theyre significantly higher than that and from a ratings standpoint the portfolio rated very nicely very closely to fnb so very pleased overall with it indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania im sorry just for a second on the accretion so the total purchase account accretion in the first quarter was about million prehoward and that number kind of would be projected to come down as it has kind of on a quarterly basis and then you add in howard with kind of a quarter that we were talking about so net net you know well be somewhere between million to million a quarter you know over the next few quarters all that howard plus what we had in the fourth timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it okay thats helpful thank you and then just one more followup for me so glad to see that the pipeline is being rebuilt im just wondering as you look out at the expected loan growth this year is the composition going to be similar to what we saw kind of in the back end of or with some of these new digital initiatives should we expect to see more of the loan production coming on the consumer side versus on the commercial side vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well to start the year off were seeing pretty strong production coming out of the consumer bank until and i attribute that to a couple of things some of it is just economic macroeconomic some of it is the embedding of the estore into our mobile application and our online offerings basically what weve done is weve pushed that weve pushed those products essentially put them in front of the client repeatedly in those digital channels so and theyre able to act on it pretty easily or schedule an appointment and go out and see somebody in a branch for example its added to our online user base weve increased online users yearoveryear we have over enrolled users now our mobile banking is up the number of mortgage applications that weve pushed through our estore is up to of production which is up from weve invested pretty heavily in a number of areas but if you look at the total estore visits that i mentioned thats up yearoveryear so that for us is a very reasonable way right to advertise our products and services particularly when theres macroeconomic factors at play people need to borrow money for renovation so that that seems to be working for us the data analytics tools that weve put into place and the leads that were able to generate the analysis that we do on pools of data in our data hub thats helped us immensely we can find opportunities within that in a systemic way we can find opportunities within the portfolio and then exploit them by contacting those customers proactively and if you look at all of those statistics in total theres quite a bit going on there and its driving that activity on the commercial side i think that were well positioned we have very very good bankers across the footprint theyre high quality bankers we dont have a lot of carpet baggers whos a lot of bankers that ran corporate banking groups for a long time theres a lot of bankers that move around from bank to bank to bank we dont have a lot of that we have pretty sound respected bankers in each of the markets theyve not ph gone to around times we may have attracted them here for career opportunities we really rely pretty fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 heavily on their skill set salesmanship being one of a series of skills that we expect so i think were starting to see the benefits of all this anyway thats vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania reduction in the first quarter was very strong originations levels were very strong vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania originations were strong and so timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the color much appreciate it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah all right thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies tyler marks q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning this is tyler marks on for casey following up on franks question on the share buyback appetite how much lower are you willing to go below your target cet1 ratio of vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say thats really the target that were managing to were for this quarter and we were a year ago and i think in the prior quarter so thats really the level were using is kind our floor to manage to with the earnings generation capabilities plus the expectation for higher rates obviously that generates more earnings which is open for guidance so we use that as kind of a governor and well be dependent on the amount of loan activity the loan activity was lower for some reason weve be more active here but if you look at what we did with first program we bought back million at a very attractive price as i mentioned we were opportunistic when the opportunities were there ph and the market was dipping and we still think our stock is still very attractive value so we will continue to be opportunistic and we were down to million or so so were wanting to approve new levels to give us that flexibility to manage capital but is really kind of the governor that were using we think thats a good level for us in the overall profile of the company and as we move up above that well opportunistically do share buybacks tyler marks q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and then how are you addressing this secular pressure seen with the overdraft fees and is your fee guide assuming any of this impact within service charges fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania im sorry can you repeat the question i tyler marks q analyst jefferies llc yeah how are you addressing the secular pressures seen with overdraft fees and is your fee guide assuming any of this impact within service vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay sorry i didnt hear secular pressure i was wondering what that was so i heard i know what youre talking about first of all we had weve rolled out a product that is bank on certified that we recommend to clients particularly those that are afraid that theyre going to overdraft or have an issue with overdraft and it just simply does not permit it so the product that we offer just you cant overdraft the account if there is an overdraft because of some pos transaction or some posting issue its refunded to the customer so we have this product that we rolled out its a top four product for us its actually the third most popular checking account product so its already had an impact on overdraft fees for us and weve made a number of changes over the years to our overdraft practices and plan on continuing to make those changes and i think we mentioned when we rolled out the guide for the year on fee income that we were expecting that category to decline throughout the year so thats another area add that to the mortgage and other capital markets area that i said therell be headwind pressure that we have to overcome or make up thats another category i dont have an exact number for you i dont have it at my fingertips but its a pretty meaningful decline that we were expecting because of that pressure and there are additional changes coming to our practices but its reflected in the guide that we had given you at the beginning of the year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just add too that the consumer fees are about million in the quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania just to put it in perspective tyler marks q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks so much vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania take care thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from michael perito with kbw michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks just one last kind of clarification question for me is just curious if you guys could comment you talked about howard going well and some of the appetite on the buyback were maybe putting the whole capital deployment picture together here as we move forward it seems like the fundamental outlook is fairly bullish for you guys margins moving higher growth pipelines are filled the expense guide was unchanged i mean how do you view the new buyback program versus incremental ma as you guys look out over the next to months just in terms of the capital deployment priorities as you guys see it thatll be great thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean we spent a lot of time modeling all of these things and evaluating them i mean we look at loan growth relative to buybacks from a return on capital perspective we look at ma in the same way so our decisions are based upon whats best for the company and the shareholders moving forward so we try to balance that out i think having the ability to buy shares back in the event that loan growth doesnt materialize or ma opportunities that are accretive and provide us with substantial returns over our cost of capital arent out there we have another tool to essentially return capital to the shareholders so we look at it as kind of a backstop and then we evaluate the options so im not ruling anything out nor am i saying that theres something looming im just simply telling you that were very careful about the deployment of capital and we look at the effect on tangible book value dilution and the earn back and all of that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and the primary focus the loan growth is the primary focus to produce capital vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so thats really if the loan growth is strong thats where well put our capital if it slows like vince said then we look at the buyback and become more active on the buyback fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it but i guess just to be clear i mean so if your growth guidance is achieved as expected and no additional ma comes to fruition for this year you guys would expect given current market conditions that buyback would be utilized to some extent vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah got it great thank you guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks michael operator thank you and the next question comes from russell gunther with da davidson russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey russell gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co good morning so just the bigger picture in terms of better understanding your view of the operating environment from a growth perspective so on the one hand weve talked about how pipelines are often and giving increased confidence in that midtohigh singledigits and then on the other the potential for a softer environment and caution from a credit launch perspective just things you guys are focused on there so does the midsingle digit guide reflect a stable operating environment growth environment or are you dialing in the potential for some softer growth in the back half of the year recessionary pressures just to help me frame that would be great thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think midsingle digits dials in the current environment including the factors that we laid out as potential areas of concern i dont want to alarm everyone we havent seen as i said we havent seen weakness yet but those are areas that any prudent banker would look at and say hey weve got a number of things coming at us we have to be prepared to deal with right so that could potentially result in a slowing of the us economy and lower loan demand and itll hit first in the commercial segment theres some talk about consumer spending declining in the latter half of this year ive read that in a number of economists reports some economists say they think consumers are stronger than we expect well see how that plays out if you look at whats going on right now and we only know whats happening at our bank and within our portfolios right the consumer portfolio pipeline is up record levels gary mentioned the mortgage business has shifted pretty dramatically to purchase money the commercial business slowed in the first quarter weve had the war in ukraine and some supply chain disruption and a very robust pipeline in the fourth quarter that was closed the closed indiscernible converted to production and weve got some seasonal slowness so our expectation which is built into our guide is that the beginning of the year would be slower things would start to accelerate just like they did last year were in the same spot last year a little better growth in the first quarter than last year and the consumer bank didnt have anywhere near the production and pipelines that we have this for so i hope that sums it up for you im cautious about our growth prospects as we move throughout the year obviously with gary and hes a very skilled professional his team tom fisher the people we have here were watching very carefully whats happening and were going to continue to monitor it because we dont want to balloon into a recession right so thats why were giving you the guidance were giving you but its all baked in weve thought a lot about it spent a lot of time modeling it its built from the ground up portfolio by portfolio and thats how we derived it russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co yeah i appreciate it vince its exactly the type of color i was hoping to better understand so i appreciate indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 sorry i can understand its confusing right because on one hand were saying hey were going to achieve mid to high single digit loan growth then on the other hand were saying were a little concerned about certain things that are going on in the economic environment they could potentially impact that growth in the latter half of the year so i think given the geographic diversification the quality of the credit portfolio the skill of the bankers we can achieve our guide russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i appreciate the color thats it for me guys thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brody lisa constantine a managerinvestor relations fnb corp pennsylvania good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey i just wanted to maybe circle back thanks for all the color on the security book earlier i just wanted to ask and just clarify was it million per quarter in cash flows that you said or that youre reinvesting vince and fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 then could you give us an indication as to what the new yields look like that are coming on the book versus whats rolling off there in that repricing cadence vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the month cash flow we estimate is billion and thats rolling off of the yield of million if you look at where were putting money to work so far this quarter weve invested million so far in april yields closer to new purchases are still within that kind of to duration a little bit on the higher end of that but still within that kind of indiscernible so thats kind of the moving parts there brody if that answers you brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thats helpful thank you and i just wanted to ask on the timing of the hikes that you all are modeling i know you have the basis points in may but beyond that wheres the additional basis points coming in from a timing perspective christopher chan a senior vice president director of corporate strategy and development fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its pretty much basis point per meeting brody after that brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thanks chris i did have one follow up on the capital markets business could you remind me i know you have a lot that kind of goes into it but could you remind me what the big drivers are from a revenue perspective within capital markets vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania absolutely we have syndications we love large cre and ci syndications we have a big derivatives practice that i mentioned which focuses principally on interest rate derivatives but theres the ability to do commodity based derivatives within that space as well then we have international banking which we drove into the capital markets arena because were offering hedging products in the international space and spot transactions then we have our i call it the debt capital markets platform where we participate in bond economics public bond offerings now that business was started last year and i think that pretty much covers it those are the principal areas that drive the bulk of the revenue in capital markets and the syndications business is lumpy right because you get big syndications if you underwrite a deal youre getting paid more heavily than the best efforts arrangement and then the debt capital markets area is lumpy too because if youre participating in a larger deal and we may be getting syndications fee income because were participating in the distribution and were getting now bond economics right because the companies issue public debt or included in the syndicate anyway those are the businesses that we have brody preston q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 got it thank you for that and i have some two last ones indiscernible the first one is on expenses can you kind of maybe give us a sense for what would cause you all to be either at the low end or the highend of the expense guidance just in terms of are there any individual items that come to mind that would that would cause it to be one way or the other vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say as you know we manage expenses very tightly within the company weve had that discipline for for many many years within our guidance for for as we mentioned in january was million cost savings target we have the cost savings from our still to be realized given the timing in the quarter some of thats going to be realized for on track for what we initially said early on one of the drivers is always commissions tied to production so that can swing depending on the business activity and the different businesses so that is a swing item it could move from quarter to quarter and kind of can get moving within that range but well continue to manage expenses tightly as we always have and i think the range for the full year is a pretty tight range so i hope theyre really the key drivers for us and weve talked in the past about rpa continuing to go after ways to automate our processes and making sure that thats just continuous every day and theres more opportunities to test some of that stuff to get done quicker theres opportunity there too but again its a pretty tight range id say for the guidance brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you and then my last question would be vince i just want to followup i appreciate the color on the deposit betas that you all are modeling i think it was interestbearing was what you mentioned and that thats pretty pretty in line with last cycle and so i guess i wanted to for what you did on the interest bearing deposit beta side last cycle and so i guess i wanted to get your thoughts on whats driving the beta to be close to last cycle i think a lot of folks initially just given industrywide improvements in terms of liquidity lower loanto deposit ratios off the cash higher securities balances are thinking that maybe betas could lag last cycle at least on a percentage basis that youre assuming indicates that you expect them to be in line so could you give us any color on why you expect that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say what we did the last time was probably would be around would be kind of maybe the historical rate and things are quite a bit different as far as liquidity in the system so were kind of inside that to begin with as far as indiscernible and then as i mentioned earlier again were being conservative on the betas were going to manage them to optimize the gearings for the company overall and not be more aggressive than we need to be so as i said earlier i think theres some conservatism baked into that but even at the basis points were we are kind of inside of i think last quarter we said basis points so were at basis points and i think the pace of the changes the rapid nature of them the large amount basis point moves its just something we have to manage closely and the customers get more alert as things are going through so its just for all of us to mention but i would just say the basis points is inside of basis points brody i guess bottom line is that theres conservatism within the betas brody preston q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 got it thank you very much for taking all my questions and for giving us all the time this morning guys i appreciate it vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys thanks for taking the question just a couple of follow ups here just the the yield on new loans vince on commercial loans can you just talk about where those are at where those are coming on today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania you want ph me go ahead vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible new loans in total i would say came on at million during the quarter that was million last quarter so so clearly kind of a nice move up the overall spot portfolio rate ex ppp thats down like million increased basis points to million so thats kind of all in features there brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thats helpful and then just a couple other housekeeping the line of credit line utilizations it didnt sound like that moved up a lot this quarter is that is that fair is it pretty similar to what it was last quarter but the expectation is its going to move higher is that kind of what im hearing vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think with the debt capital markets platform we did some larger transactions that were unfunded so that kind of we got fee income so we would expect those to fund up at some point right so we brought over larger commitments with lower borrowings on them thats part of it the other part is as ive said i think when you drill down into the various segments we saw certain areas starting to grow expand small business middle market banking on the ci side saw expansion and then we brought on some large construction deals and those large corporate transactions which kind of kept us still or moved it back slightly actually kind of flat but slightly down if you took those out of the equation we saw an expansion in utilization so i dont have the exact numbers for you but thats what we were seeing fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would add overall if you look yearoveryear it did move up about points from first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year and then its pretty stable to where it was at the end of the year kind of in that mid i would expect it to continue to move up over time it was running in the to range historically we expect it to get back there at some point brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay and then just last couple just on the power the expense savings just kind of is second quarter kind of largely a clean quarter given the back office consolidation this quarter i guess or just kind of how should we think about that that clean expense quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so like we said in an announcement we expect cost saves to be greater than and were well on track on getting to the phase in that we talked about during i mean howard really didnt add that many expenses to the quarter i mean were talking its low you know less than midsingledigit million type number brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yes vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so but i think weve got a pretty good handle on the expense saves and where were going for the rest of the year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian i would think it would take some more like the third quarter to kind of get clean where i mean second quarter yeah brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible branches right now were doing some renovations as that finishes up during the summer youll see kind of the last bit of the tail come out fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thats helpful and then just on the just given the cautiousness about some items you mentioned just kind of the reserve coverage with some of the noise this quarter with howard i mean where do you see the given your outlook on credit quality seems pretty robust to that with some caution just kind of with that reserve level the reserve coverage may trend to over the next couple of quarters vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania gary whats your gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian yeah in terms of in terms of the reserve i mean weve been very cautious all through the pandemic and didnt have any large releases as youre aware with the headwinds that we see out there with inflation supply chain transportation costs higher interest rates those things as weve talked were cautious about them and they do have the ability to impact borrowers that are on the lower end of the liquidity range or higher end of the leverage range we were flat in the quarter at million even including bringing howard on were comfortable with that level right now and well continue to watch it all play out as we as we move forward despite only basis points of chargeoffs the other thing thats going to play a role there is loan growth weve talked about that a good bit today and that has its impact so i would i would tell you that were looking at right now the guy being basis points to basis points could it truly come in on the low end of that guide based on the strength of the book right now surely it can but i would expect with all the headwinds well be cautious around those items as we move forward brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it thanks gary and then just last one vince calabrese i guess just last quarter you talked about the liquidity levels kind of maybe cutting that in half by yearend i think youre still a similar level on liquidity right now i guess is that still your expectation or is these kind of how youre thinking about things vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its hard to say i mean the deposits keep growing indiscernible million of forgiveness and thats goes into the coffers too so i would think thats probably too low at this point and well see how the year plays out brian but i thought itd already start moving down and weve been saying that for six quarters now so those deposits are i think plus growing so i would think wed start to slowly bring that number down but the pace of it is just hard to say with certainty brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay okay thank you for taking the questions guys vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you fnb corp
