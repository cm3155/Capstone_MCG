chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks mark and thank you to everyone for joining the call today before we begin id like to express my sympathies to those of you whove lost family members or friends or whove been directly impacted by the virus well open today with an overview of how weve reacted to the onset of the pandemic what the challenges it has created as well as the opportunities pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption around the world extreme market volatility has altered the global economic landscape the virus has changed the way we live our daily lives changed how business is conducted in the shortterm probably the longterm as well for huntington i believe our purpose and our deeply rooted culture are an extraordinary asset our purpose of looking out for people has guided our planning and responses to the pandemic from the beginning weve recognized the pandemic is first and foremost a public health crisis therefore our priority has always been the safety and wellbeing of our colleagues and our customers many of our colleagues are on the front lines with our customers every day and its challenged us to serve our customers in new ways to assure their safety in our branches we moved early to drivethru only with inperson meetings by appointment we closed all instore branches and traditional branches which did not have drivethru for most other colleagues we implemented a workfromhome policy and now have more than of our colleagues working remotely this is possible because of the commitment and flexibility of our colleagues and because of the tremendous work by our technology teams to keep everyone connected and productive we benefited from the diligent work performed by our business continuity planning teams over the years we also increased our communication with colleagues not only to keep them informed but also to keep them engaged and in a position to help our customers finally we added new benefits for our colleagues such as emergency paid time off and other programs for those whose families were directly impacted by the virus and we took actions to enhance the mental and physical well being of our colleagues it was clearly immediately that our customers would face financial hardships because of the pandemic we took swift action early and publicly announcing a variety of relief program measures and included loan payment deferrals fee waivers and the suspension of foreclosures and repossessions these measures addressed our customers crippled shortterm needs we believe they also demonstrated our purpose of action showing our customers that we are there for them now and well continue to support them in the future we believe its in our best mutual interest to work with our customers during tough times relationships are strengthened in these moments thousands of colleagues from across the bank mobilized to help small business and commercial customers access the sba paycheck protection program and over the last three weeks weve redeployed and trained over colleagues to support the heavy volume of sba applications im pleased to say that we processed almost applications in record time with a loan volume of more than billion we were able to process almost every one of these applications into the sba etran system before it closed when funding was exhausted on april we entered with a relatively healthy economic backdrop across our footprint and prospects for the national economy appeared to be picking up however the pandemic has altered the trajectory for the foreseeable future and we believe the economy will be challenged for some time weve tried to assess what is in store for the economy now we informed our thinking with multiple potential economic scenarios the best case is huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 characterized by a deep vshaped economy with the trough in the second quarter followed by a relatively strong recovery later this year more likely scenario could be described as a long ushaped recovery in which the trough extends later into the year and then the economy does not recover back to precovid activity levels until well into over the course of the last two months the economic outlook has progressively deteriorated and it appears that the reopening of the economy will be more protracted than initially expected and a ushape recovery is the increasingly likely scenario so given this highly uncertain environment and rapidly evolving outlook we do not believe we can provide any meaningful expectations for the full year at this time therefore weve withdrawn our formal full year guidance our visibility is generally limited to the next few months the range of potential outcomes on the key metrics is quite wide instead zach will provide some nearterm expectations later in the presentation conservative view on the economic outlook also forms our thinking on how we manage capital liquidity and credit zach and rich will discuss our current metrics on these items later but id like to discuss generally how were thinking about risk management as weve previously discussed over the past decade we fundamentally changed huntingtons enterprise risk management we believe its now a strength for the company as compared to a clear weakness during the prior cycle slide in the presentation details several of the key improvements weve implemented but they all began with the establishment of our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite in and the alignment of our credit strategy and policy with that appetite weve also centralized credit underwriting and portfolio management implementing credit concentration limits and materially repositioned the balance sheet over time we implemented a deep relationship focused across the bank focusing on the primary bank relationships and exiting loanonly relationships that did not meet appropriate return hurdles in subsequent years we took actions such as tightening our consumer lending standards to focus on super prime customers across all our consumer lending products and tightened our underwriting on commercial real estate we established conservative standards and policies for leveraged lending as well weve pointed out over time that the only comparison of potential loss for the sector is the federal reserves dfast stress test as shown on slide our modeled cumulative loan losses in dfast severely adverse scenario are consistently among the best in the peer group as we assessed the current environment with respect to the credit impact weve tried to be conservative and you can see this in the level of provisioning and our allowance for credit losses were taking a similar conservative approach to capital our capital ratios are strong we intend to maintain high capital ratios as a source of strength to support our customers needs and to be positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities with that let me turn it over to zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides the highlights for the first quarter clearly results were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic while our underlying earnings momentum were strong first quarter results included provision for credit losses of million over net chargeoffs recognized during the quarter this was driven by the severely weakened economic outlook compared to the fourth quarter of rich will go into more detail regarding the drivers of the increase in our provision shortly but now lets turn to slide to review our pretax preprovision earnings huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 yearoveryear pretax preprovision earnings growth was we believe this is strong performance in light of the challenges of the interest rate environment and the rapid decline in shortterm rates yeartodate total revenue increased versus the year ago quarter as growth in fee income more than offset modest pressure on spread revenues specifically robust mortgage banking income growth of and growth in capital markets fees drove the million or yearoveryear growth in noninterest income fte net interest income decreased million or yearoveryear as basis points of nim compression overwhelmed growth in average earning assets on a linked quarter basis the nim expanded basis points as we continue to be pleased with the results of our hedging program and our diligent efforts to reduce our deposit costs i would like to call your attention to two slides on the appendix that provide important additional information regarding our efforts in these two areas to support the margin slide summarizes the hedging actions weve taken to reduce the unfavorable impacts of interest rate volatility and lower interest rate environment we continuously monitor and prudently refine our interest rate risk management as the interest rate environment balance sheet mix and other factors necessitate slide provides an update on the reduction of deposit costs as cds and money market promotional rates repriced lower and we actively managed commercial deposit costs the slide illustrates the downward trajectory of our total interestbearing deposit costs by month since july including a basis point decline from february to march we expect this downward trend to continue given the deposit repricing opportunities that remain in total expenses are essentially unchanged from the year ago quarter this expense discipline reflects the actions we took in the fourth quarter to reduce our overhead expense run rate including the reduction of positions and the closure of instore branches as well as actions we took during q1 to quickly react to the current environment balanced against the impact of continued investment in our technology capabilities during the quarter we began the first steps of a multipart expense management plan for which provided some benefit in the quarter by reducing the most immediately flexible expense lines i will provide more details on this later finally i would like to note that normal slides detailing comparisons for our net interest income net interest margin fee income and noninterest expense can be found in the appendix turning to slide our average earning assets increased billion or compared to the year ago quarter average total securities increased from the year ago quarter reflecting portfolio growth and the markto market on our availableforsale securities were no longer reinvesting securities cash flows and instead are using this liquidity to fund loan growth average loans and leases increased million or yearoveryear primarily driven by the consumer portfolio consumer loan growth remained focused on the residential mortgage portfolio reflecting robust originations over the past four quarters average commercial and industrial loans increased from the year ago quarter as commercial activity was restrained by economic uncertainty during the first two months of the quarter however on a linked quarter basis we saw end of period ci loans grow reflecting significant drawdown activity on credit lines during march we saw billion of commercial credit lines while weve seen draw activity continue in the first weeks of april with another million drawn through april the pace has started to slow significantly it is uncertain how long customers will retain these funds as extra liquidity and a backstop against ongoing disruption in the credit markets we continue to actively manage our commercial real estate portfolio around current levels with average cre loans reflecting a yearoveryear decrease huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 turning now to slide average core deposits increased yearoveryear note that this growth rate was negatively impacted by the june 2019s sale of the wisconsin retail branch network which included approximately million or almost of core deposits on a linked quarter basis end of period total deposits increased reflecting the aforementioned draws of commercial lines that were subsequently maintained on the balance sheet in various commercial deposit products importantly the amount of commercial deposit inflows over the past several weeks has essentially matched the amount of commercial line draws allowing us to maintain excess liquidity to meet future customer lending needs we continue to see a migration in deposit balances from cds and savings into money market accounts reflecting shifting customer preferences and a shift in the focus of our promotional pricing average money market deposits increased yearoveryear while savings decreased and core cds decreased we expect this dynamic to continue through average interestbearing dda deposits increased yearoveryear while noninterestbearing dda increased as shown on slide in the appendix we are very pleased that our consumer noninterestbearing deposits increased yearoveryear this growth highlights our continued focus on new customer acquisition and relationship deepening slide illustrates the continued strength of our capital ratios the common equity tier ratio or cet1 ended the quarter at down basis points yearoveryear the tangible common equity ratio or tce ended the quarter at down basis points from a year ago during the first quarter through midmarch we repurchased million common shares at an average cost of per share or a total of million when the covid19 pandemic first started to impact the us we paused our buyback for the remainder of the first quarter we do not currently intend to repurchase any shares for the balance of this morning we announced the board declared the second quarter cash dividend of per share unchanged from the prior quarter we expect to sustain the dividend at this level during periods of macro stress and market volatility managing liquidity is paramount our position of strength and liquidity draws its foundation from our deposit base and the depth of our relationship with our customers our ratio of loans to deposits is stable at in addition we have considerable additional sources of liquidity including our portfolio of liquid securities and borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank and federal reserves discount window slide highlights our relative capital strength over the past few years we have maintained our capital position and are now in the top third of regional banking peers on total riskbased capital our dividend yield is also in the high end of the peer group let me now turn it over to rich to cover credit including cecl rich richard a pohle chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks zach before i provide details on the performance of the first quarter i wanted to elaborate on the comments steve touched on at the beginning of the call huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 slide details some of these decisions we have made and credit risk management enhancements we have implemented in we heightened our underwriting standards for leveraged lending since we drafted our leveraged lending policy in we have used a conservative senior leverage multiple of times to qualify as a leveraged loan for our borrowers with less than million of revenue also in we began leveraging the underwriting infrastructure and standards of our auto finance business the rv and marine portfolio that was expanded through the firstmerit acquisition recall that our indirect auto and floorplan dealer dealer floorplan portfolios are among the best performing to dfast we prepared for the eventual economic downturn we adjusted our health care portfolio by curtailing new construction originations in the longterm care segment our health care construction portfolio is now down from where it was in over the past couple of years weve continued to refine our credit underwriting consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite we have increased fico score cuts across our heloc and rv and marine books and held our commercial businesses to higher standards with respect to credit policy exceptions so we entered the current credit environment with a portfolio that has been continually finetuned over the last several years slide illustrates the relative rankings of modeled cumulative loan losses for huntington and our peers in the federal reserves severely adverse scenarios or dfast exercise as steve has mentioned over time this is the only true comparison of credit risk across the sector that we know of and it provides us independent validation of the credit risk management we have implemented we like that our portfolio was evenly split between consumer and commercial businesses it gives us nice diversification in periods of stress and our dfast numbers reflect as much still the aforementioned steps have strengthened the quality of our loan portfolios turning now to the first quarter credit results metrics slide provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses or acl following the adoption of cecl on january and the first quarters provision the acl increased to of total loans up from at year end the increase was comprised of the million day one adjustment and a million reserve build in the day two provision during the first quarter as you recall the day one increase was a function of our weighting in the consumer portfolio which has a much longer weighted average life and therefore a larger lifetime loss under cecl for the quarter our reserve build consisted of a million increase due primarily to the ongoing economic uncertainty and a million net increase in our specific reserves almost exclusively against our oil and gas portfolio the q1 acl now includes a reserve against our oil and gas portfolio the multiple data points we used besides the adjustment we made in q1 including the moodys baseline scenario that showed unemployment rising to near and gdp levels falling by in q2 and different levels of recovery in subsequent quarters we also weighted unprecedented level of government stimulus both to consumers as well as businesses and the potential support to the economy that will provide these factors drove our q1 provisions the more recent april economic models now show further deterioration with unemployment reaching and gdp falling by in q2 and an improvement in q3 that provides less of a net recovery than the march base case showed we will continue to evaluate data points like these as we size our provision expense for the second quarter slide shows our npas and tdrs and demonstrates the impact that our oil and gas portfolio has had on our overall level of npas we have discussed for several quarters the challenges we see with this portfolio and have been proactive in recognizing the earnings impact we anticipate as commodity prices continue to range below economical levels for this industry oil and gas npas represent just under half of our commercial npas and onethird of our overall npas they are also a significant contributor to our q1 npa increase notably over from a dollar standpoint of these npas huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 remain current with respect to principal and interest payments on top of our oil and gas portfolio commercial npas were reduced in the first quarter by million slide demonstrates that we have a fairly modest exposure to some of the areas that have been hardest hit by covid19 today we have recently completed deep dives into nearly all these portfolios and are comfortable with our teams assessment of the current situation our restaurant exposures primarily the national quick service brands that have maintained driveup operations and our sandwich and pizza chain customers have been open for takeout service to offset the declines in inhouse seating slide details our leveraged lending portfolio our conservative definition uses times senior leverage for borrowers with under million of revenues to account for heightened risks in leveraging smaller companies our leveraged loan book represents under of our total loans and as a percentage of capital was at its lowest point in several years we focus on borrowers that are weighted toward manufacturers as opposed to service and other assetlight borrowers they tend to provide more collateral within the manufacturing segment of our leveraged lending book there are no subsegments that account for more than we deliberately avoided covenantlite term loan b structures because the play in that market generally requires providing an understructured paripassu revolving credit commitment as well that revolver is typically undrawn at closing that represents potential contingent risk in a down cycle we hope regular reviews of this portfolio and underwriting follows a consistent corporate process with a designated leveraged lending credit executive responsible for its review slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases in the current quarter up from basis points in the prior quarter and up from basis points in the year ago quarter the increase was centered on the oil and gas portfolio and one large coalrelated commercial credit which together made up approximately threefourths of the total commercial net chargeoffs the oil and gas portfolio continues to be impacted by low commodity prices and limited capital markets activity as i mentioned earlier we have allocated significant reserves against this portfolio annualized net chargeoffs excluding the oil and gas and coalrelated losses were basis points demonstrating that the balance of our portfolio performed well in q1 our remaining coal exposure is under million of which carries an investmentgrade guarantee nonperforming asset ratio increased basis points linked quarter and basis points yearoveryear to basis points due to the oil and gas impact i described earlier consumer chargeoffs were down to basis points in q1 as compared to basis points a year ago demonstrating our continued strong consumer portfolio as always weve provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package on the slides let me turn it back over to zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you rich as steve mentioned earlier we have withdrawn our full year guidance historically weve refrained from providing quarterly guidance as it implies a much shorter time horizon than we manage the company that said we want to provide you with much insight into key business trends as we can so we will focus on where we can frame realistic expectations therefore slide provides comments on the second quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 starting with loans the billion of commercial line draws we saw in march and into early april will drive average commercial loans to higher over the near term excluding any impact of the billion of sba ppp loans and any additional sba ppp loans made in the next phase we currently expect the majority of commercial line draws to remain outstanding for the next several months the duration of the ppp loans is uncertain but we expect the large majority of them to be forgiven and to come off the sheet quickly we expect consumer loans to be flattomodestly lower the auto portfolio and to a lesser extent the rv marine portfolio is expected to reduce as vehicle sales activity declines we expect the preexisting trend of runoff in home equity to continue and we expect the residential mortgage portfolio to be flat to modestly higher in the second quarter as robust level of refinancing activity acts as a governor on growth we expect average core deposits to increase to linked quarter similar to our expectations for commercial loans we expect the recent influx of the commercial deposits again excluding the impact of ppp to remain on the balance sheet through the second quarter we expect average consumer core deposits to be flat to slightly higher as slowing customer deposit acquisition is offset by similar reductions in attrition given altered branch traffic and consumer behaviors on the other hand we expect the bulk of the proceeds of the ppp program will steadily flow out of the bank over the next eight weeks consistent with the intent of the program we now expect deposit growth to fully fund loan growth in the second quarter moving to the income statement provisioning is a key driver of variability in the q2 earnings outlook but revenue and noninterest expenses also have a wider than normal range with possible outcomes weve modeled various realistic scenarios for the revenue and expense outlook some of which provide the opportunity for us to achieve our annual goal of positive operating leverage and some of which do not we continue to believe the positive operating leverage is an important part of our longterm value creation model but we will not allow a shortterm view of this one metric to dictate our decisions we constantly strive to find the right balance between the short and longterm results within these confines we expect total revenue to decline to linked quarter as the larger average balance sheet is more than offset by moderate pressure on the organic nim and the covid19 related declines in fee income customer activity based fee income lines items including deposit service charges card and payment processing are all expected to be pressured mortgage banking is expected to remain robust but historically wide secondary marketing spreads are expected to gradually reduce all combined our current expectation is for fee income to be down approximately sequentially we have a little more control and less visibility into the expense outlook for the second quarter we expect non interest expenses to increase between and on a sequential basis driven primarily by the seasonal increase in compensationrelated expense related to the annual grant of longterm incentives and annual merit increases partially offset by our expense reduction actions on a yearoveryear basis expenses will be lower by we have begun our rigorous expense management plan we entered like prior years having constructed expense management contingency plans and when the challenges facing became clear we began implementing these plans our approach is focused on four categories of expenses discretionary expenses such as travel and sponsorships investments including marketing the pacing and prioritization of digital and technology investments and planned business expansions structural expenses such as the size and composition of our branch network and corporate facilities infrastructure and finally organizational expenses which include huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 the size of the organization and compensation levels across the company the actions well take across these categories vary in terms of how quickly they can be implemented the quickest expense levers we can pull are within discretionary spending our travel and entertainment spending has been reduced dramatically as a result of the lockdown and social distancing measures were also curtailing nonessential consulting and outside services expenses in the investment category given the macro environment depressing customer acquisition activities were prudently reducing nearterm marketing expenses were also scrutinizing all preexisting business expansion plans and have delayed some initiatives however we are maintaining our digital and mobile technology investments while less immediate in impact the decisions regarding structural and organizational expenses will provide opportunities to reduce our future expense trajectory well not be providing details at this time regarding the ultimate scale or timing of our expense actions but know that we are taking decisive actions finally the most uncertain item in the earnings outlook is credit provisioning we currently expect net chargeoffs in the second quarter to be near the high end of our average throughthecycle target range to basis points this is reflective of the ongoing pressure in the oil and gas portfolio as well as broader economic considerations fundamentally our credit remains sound however the economic outlook has continued to deteriorate since quarter end and remains highly intervened this will result in elevated provisioning and additional reserve building in the second quarter and most likely for the next several quarters it is much too early to estimate the ultimate size of the additional reserve build but you should expect us to remain conservative in our approach to credit risk management i will now turn it over to mark so we can get to your questions mark mark muth directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach sherry we will now take questions we ask that operator thanks mark muth directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has any additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is from erika najarian with bank of america please proceed erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi my first question is for rich im wondering if you could give us a sense on of how your allowance was allocated by loan category please richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah by loan category i mean weve got the consumer was about and commercial was to get to the of total allowance thats the breakdown that weve got for that erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i think erika you have to the challenge that we have with the allowance in this quarter is the models really werent trained for this right and so we had the severe decline in the economic scenario and the government stimulus that is forthcoming but really hasnt shown up yet at the end of the first quarter so theres a lot of judgment that went into setting the provision this quarter various economic models that came out throughout the month of march we just look at a number of factors when we set the provision weve got the coverage ratios at the end of the quarter where we want them erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my followup question is appreciate the detail on reserves relative to dfast losses and when i look at the fed run test and even your company run test from it seems like theres a pretty significant contribution still from commercial real estate and im wondering as we think about how future chargeoffs in this type of recession can play out for huntington what are sort of the model biases in the stress test model and i guess im reading the question a little bit by referring to commercial real estate that might distort how were thinking about what can actually be incurred in terms of chargeoffs in other words what part of the stress test is huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 backward very backward looking in terms of historical losses in cre and what part of the stress test obviously unemployment is one place seems to be not severe enough richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc so as it relates to i think you hit the nail on the head the dfast numbers are backwards looking so the fundamental change that has transpired over this company since the last downturn has been remarkable and i would say that commercial real estate is probably the one area where we are so fundamentally different today than we were going back i mean we had close to customers on the commercial real estate side going into the last downturn we have about customers today so there is a clear focus on tier sponsors tier sponsors institutional sponsors and so we really focus on knowing the developer and not only the projects that were financing but the projects that might be financed somewhere else to make sure that were not overextended there we also from a percentage of capital standpoint were over of capital going into the last downturn were under of capital today and with very strict limits on various sublimits within the commercial real estate space so i think thats the biggest one as it relates to some of the other things clearly unemployment is going to be a big driver of losses on the consumer side i think the dfast results there have been very consistent over time that our consumer charge offs in the dfast scenario must have been at the top of our peer group so i feel very good about where we stand in a lot of the consumer categories relative to the dfast results from stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc erika i might add this is steve the joblessness or unemployment levels in ohio and michigan were double digit when we made the changes to the consumer lending policies and the models that we have used subsequently have been based in that so i think in ohio and 14andafractionpercent in michigan so that has drove us to a super prime level of our origination we use our prop score but the equivalent ficos youve seen quarterly for years and we will attack the book so we believe weve got a very sound consumer loan portfolio and the performance expectations around that will is we believe is important through this cycle notwithstanding higher unemployment and somewhat higher losses and weve been talking for several quarters about oil and gas as an outsized exposure for us in terms of risk of loss clearly outside of our aggregate moderatetolow appetite and weve also shared that we expect to address that substantially early this year and having started to do that last year so these oil and gas credits are all snccs our losses from what we can tell are i mean were taking it earlier than certainly earlier than required including the nonaccrual decisions and i think were frankly going to be slightly ahead or ahead of others in the industry in that regard erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you steve operator our next question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i was hoping for maybe a little more detail on the overall modifications and deferrals definitely get the number of customers but maybe if there are some dollars of total modifications in both the consumer and commercial portfolios richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc were happy to answer that for you scott its rich yeah on the consumer side its about billion of deferrals that weve processed we also have made some deferrals for some of the mortgages that were a servicing agent but for our book its about billion on the commercial side its about billion but i would say half of that is in our auto floorplan dealerships and were counting the curtailments in that number and most of what were doing in the auto floorplan space is more curtailment than the payment deferral really the we need the cars to be on the lots a little bit longer than they have been historically just given the current environment so digging into some of the other areas where weve provided deferrals the commercial real estate and the hospitality space and retail is one other area on the commercial side and then and in the franchise restaurant space weve also been active with deferrals r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats perfect thank you and then just on sort of those latter points you made maybe if we exclude the floorplan because that makes plenty of sense logically but in the remaining commercial deferrals do you have a sense for how much of those deferrals you would say are kind of necessary or needed versus how much is customers sort of taking advantage of a kind of insurance in this environment richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i would say that the commercial real estate deferrals are needed for the most part the hotel occupancy rates given where they are i felt like i was the only one in the hotel i was at last night so i think anecdotally thats a need i think the cash crunch in commercial real estate is real and we generally did not have a high bar on proving that you needed it part of our looking out for customers is being there when they need us and so our thought was if youre asking for a deferral were generally going to give it to you but i havent come back and scientifically determined who really needed it and who didnt i would just point to commercial real estate is probably the area that needed it most stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and of the billion floorplan was richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 billion stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc billion of the billion scott so many of the showrooms just frankly arent open so r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc understandable there we take a slightly different view on the consumer side just to share with you we actually the fact that theyve asked for deferrals we take it as a good sign that they intend to stay in the residence or keep the car or other things with the rapid increase in unemployment these indications are actually positive from our perspective versus when it was hard to communicate with customers they tended to let houses go i think the nature of this health crisis will be much more likelihood to protect us than we were seeing in that prior cycle r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah the other thing r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i was pointing to is at the time of the deferral of our consumer and even a higher number of our commercial customers were current so it wasnt so this was kind of the delinquent customers reaching out for help these are good customers that needed the assistance r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you guys very much i appreciate it operator our next question is from john pancari with evercore isi please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi i appreciate the color you just gave regarding the prior the stress test and the changes in your business mix over time and how that did impact your throughthecycle losses i was just wondering if you can maybe therefore help us think about what a fair throughthecycle loss level would be given your current mix and give what youre looking at now in terms of your assessment of the economic outlook i know its tough but you want to try to get a better idea of what were looking at and then separately i know on slide youve pointed the reserve being of the to really adverse dfast but you also indicated that the april data is pointing to or did point to worsening what do you think a the incremental reserve additions could go to here what do you think an appropriate relative percentage of dfast is likely fair here thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey john im going to be challenged to answer both of your questions i think as it relates to throughthecycle losses i think the challenge that we all face is just the uncertainty that were dealing with right now as to how long this is going to last and then what the new behaviors are coming out of this so we feel good about the book going into it on the consumer side very good credit quality there we have pointed out on the commercial side that were going to have likely elevated chargeoffs in oil and gas beyond that its really hard to come up with a forecast for chargeoffs throughthecycle here stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc john were hoping to get a better view this quarter if this return to work status changes right now next week ohio looks like its going to implement on may michigan following that middle of may and as these industries start spooling up again well get a better sense of what the recovery might look like but i think this is going to be dynamic and best case would be to have a view this quarter i think its more likely going to be in third or fourth quarter before we really understand what the growth rates could be to come off what will be this very challenging moment of time and the sustainability of these businesses and ultimately how theyre going to repay us richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so as it relates to what you might see in the second quarter were clearly going to probably snap that line at the end of the quarter well take a look at all the new scenarios well look at the impact of the stimulus like i mentioned a lot of this is just kind of reaching the businesses and customers now therell be a lot more data that well have at the end of the second quarter besides what the provision expense would be for the quarter but its really tough to estimate that right now huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thats helpful thanks for that color and you indicated zach in your prepared remark that you expect to sustain the dividend can you just give us your thought process around that and does that incorporate the updated data that you see coming in now post the quarter and just your thought process around the sustainability thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i mean our intention is to maintain the dividend at the current level i think that weve got the right capital levels to support that and well continue to monitor and model what we think is the appropriate and sustainable level for now john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome thanks john operator our next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so lets start just to followup on erikas and johns question around dfast i think what a lot of us are struggling with is that when we look at cecl its supposed to look at lifetime losses the global economy has basically shut down and i think were trying to understand if you look at that framework and youre coming up with a reserve thats only of dfast losses it seems really low and i think were trying to get at isnt a large reserve build again coming like how do we reconcile the framework of whats going on in the economy and the size of the reserve versus your own internal stress test richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc steve its rich i think dfast and cecl are really two different exercises you can try to link them together but there are fundamental differences in the assumptions for reach the dfast scenario the severely adverse is a huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 deep scenario that continues for an extended period time and it also assumes that youre continuing to make loans during that period there are all sorts of dynamics that go into that cecl on the other hand is youre looking at something that is reasonable supportable over a period of time that eventually returns to the mean and so youre running in a scenario that will have a two or three year life and then theres a reversion to the mean on that and its also assuming you dont make another loan so while i think the cecl to dfast comparison is a good data point i also dont think you can necessarily draw too much from it conclusionwise steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats fair and just for a followup so if you look at slide the covid impacted sectors im surprised youre not calling out some of your auto exposures i think about floorplan or rv are you not expecting to see a material decline in revenues for these sectors right particularly auto richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i mean weve talked about auto we feel that there is going to be a shortterm impact to auto we dont necessarily think its going to fall into the same category as hotels and some of the other areas where it could just be a protracted longer impact i think ultimately people are going to get out and buy cars probably on a reduced level but we dont see the impact to auto and to a lesser extent rv that we do with some of the other ones that weve got in here stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the floorplan launched steven are to dealers that have multiple flats in the cycle we didnt have a delinquency the strategy is consistent these are very strong typically multigeneration family dealerships that have enormous wealth created over that time and dealers that we believe will be very supportive to the extent they need to part of our underwriting also looks at coverage ratio of service and parts to fixed charge and most of these are really strong in that regard richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc and just to piggyback on that i mean this obviously we did do a deep dive on the auto portfolio even though its not listed here and from a liquidity standpoint we felt the book is in very good shape steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we had a chargeoff in auto ph within i dont know two decades in what weve originated and we certainly have a lot of conviction going forward in the quality of that book huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough thanks for taking my questions richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey thanks i guess just a really quick question in terms of the energy portfolio if i heard correctly was it reserve you have against this portfolio theres other banks that we heard like yesterday has just over reserve in their energy portfolio can you just talk about the characteristics of your energy loans and how it might be different from some of the other banks that you would need such a materially higher reserve on this portfolio thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc ken well as we all know these are all snccs so there is good company in the credits that were inside i dont know that its necessarily so much that our portfolio is any worse off than others i think as steve has mentioned weve been very proactive in recognizing the risks that we see in this book and we have taken losses in this book over the last five quarters that are pretty significant and its reasonable to assume that were going to have further losses so when you see the headlines around the big banks starting to form ftes to take ownership of these credits rather than go through a liquidation process i think it tells you where the industry is heading in terms of dealing with troubled situations here so we looked at our book and we feel that the longterm fundamentals particularly for natural gas are still not strong and i think weve sized the reserve around this taking into account the where were seeing longterm prices not so much on where they are today but longer term and just the fact that there is a lack of capital markets activity in this space right now is completely different than what transpired in the last downturn so we think its appropriate to put higher levels of reserves here and well continue to review it as we go through the spring borrowing base redeterminations and kind of size that reserve going forward stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and we think this is much more like the early mid where beginning with penn square in the industry got clobbered and stayed in a tough shape for four five years and so were just trying to be realistic with that view so what we think the likely outcomes are for this portfolio and certainly weve seen subsequent price deterioration as a result of opec and russian issues on the oil side theres some spillover thats benefited gas in the shortterm but these are going to be longer term workouts youre going to see a lot of these companies combined we do think the spe is the way to go as we did in the mid im happy to have direct experience with this in that timeframe and it leads me and i think us as a consequence to be clear eyed about what to expect in the future and perhaps a bit conservative relative to some others but well see that over time huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thats helpful and then just my followup question if i heard right i think you said you expect elevated provisions for the next several quarters can you just talk more its more of a conceptual question but as i guess we would think that cecl should clearly frontend load a lot of the provision expense but i get theres a lot of uncertainty out there can you just talk about that dynamic which is how much can you really frontload for your reserve build versus like i want to get to say fourth quarter are you still maintaining a really high reserve even if and provision expense even if the economy is not weakening at that point seems like provision should be a lot lower by fourth quarter if im not mistaken richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc cecl i mean the whole concept around cecl is that you are recognizing the losses today on the books that you have today right so in a perfect world if you had perfect foresight into what the economic variables were and they didnt change you wouldnt have to make any further adjustments but clearly were in a very dynamic market where the economic assumptions that we have to use for the life of loan are going to materially change over the next several quarters and thats whats going to drive the additions or down the road hopefully the release of reserves under the cecl methodology stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good thing ken is were in a downdraft moment but as we reopen in these different states well start to get a floor and stabilization and resiliency and recovery and that could very well happen at the timeframes you mentioned based on the fiscal stimulus well be part of that the banking industry huntington will as well and for the sake of the country its great to see the industry in such a good shape so i think weve got a moment here a quarter or so couple of quarters where things are a bit uncertain but i think the picture will clarify in the foreseeable future and that clarity will give us the basis to have more confidence in projections and sharing those with you collectively and i think it will lead us to a position where having been intentionally conservative well see a better day on the horizon where i hope there will be some reserve recovery ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks a lot guys one question on the capital front so youre right in the middle of that cet1 to zone that you enjoy do you want to try to stay around that and also how does tce if at all come into your thought process around maintaining capital ratios thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah and this is zach ill take this one so yes our cet1 for q1 ended at just about our goal was to be high end of the to range over time and i would expect continued growth in capital towards the year end huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 thats the plan and intention at this point i think the fact that we mentioned paused on share repurchases for the time being for the foreseeable future is a major driver of that and we continue to model as you might imagine innumerable scenarios around where the year can play out here but the expectation is sort of continually rising towards the end of the year with the indiscernible range so thats on cet1 you talked about tce tce ended just about i think precisely and likewise our goal was to be in the somewhat higher level so i expected that ratio to trend higher throughout the year as well we think about both of the metrics beyond us we look at both of them just as much internally as each other and cet1 is a critical regulatory measure its also very comparable across banks and so its awful i think for us and for you to understand the relative position tce is a key governor though as well and particularly in the last downturn when capital was precious that measure loomed large and so were conscious that both matter and we factor both into our decisions i think that said as i look at the trajectory in both of them theyre pretty similar shaped and i would expect both to be rising modestly toward the back half of this year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and just a followup on the auto and rv marine side just in terms of the growth outlook you generally mentioned it in terms of your outlook on the consumer side we noticed that the loan originations in the first quarter in auto probably the lowest weve seen in a long time do you have a way of helping us understand given the uncertainty albeit just what do you expect the volume growth to traject like in auto and rv marine zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah we really dont have a great view on it kind of longer term in the year and thats why we tried to realistically give you what q2 will look like and we do expect continued modest downdrafts in auto just given the dynamics weve been talking before about auto dealerships being largely shuttered and therefore sales activity being lower it really will depend on the pace of the recovery when it looks like to see to what degree we start to see regrowth sequentially quartertoquarter in the back half of the year from a rv marine perspective i think were expecting less downdraft because that portfolio was always very very super prime very focused on the regions where that was a key lifestyle purchase for people and it was relatively smaller book too so i think probably expect more flattish to downish there but were also watching that pretty carefully i think you didnt ask but on the residential mortgage side we expect continued robust demand as you might expect and essentially pretty flat growth there just given that demand offsetting portfolio runoff as folks ph renew their mortgages off us ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it appreciate it zach thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 operator we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to steve for closing remarks stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you thank you all weve talked a lot today about the pandemic we reviewed the resulting economic challenges perhaps most importantly what we dont know yet id like to ask you to take a step back and ill offer you some perspective ive been there in this industry for four decades ive seen uncertainty before and while this pandemic and the elevated concern it brings is very different than any prior periods in my career we will get through this as a country one thing we know from history is americans are resilient at the core we as a nation i believe have much better days ahead were going to learn and adapt as we have in the past and build stronger more nimble organizations as a result this will be a time of change and innovation resulting in the growth and i believe huntington is well positioned to move forward we will emerge stronger and better as a result of the hard work of our colleagues and their concern for our customers and their commitment can be clearly seen in the way they quickly reoriented to new working arrangements responded to customer needs and of course helped the businesses in our local communities through the sba ppp program their unwavering commitment to our purpose has been inspiring and im proud for what our colleagues stand for and the ways theyve looked out for our customers as i reminded you frequently in the past our colleagues along with our board are among the largest shareholders of huntington collectively among the largest this is the challenges we face today are exactly why we changed our compensation plans in to make sure we are aligned with longterm shareholders faring for times like this is also why we took actions enumerated on slide amongst others to position huntington to outperform through the cycle i remain confident about our longterm prospects as we manage through this challenging environment with that i want to thank you very much for your interest in huntington have a great day
