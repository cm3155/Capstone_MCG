third quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share preprovision earnings of billion were up compared to the second quarter and compared to the year ago quarter both period end and average loans held for investment increased relative to the prior quarter driven by growth in our domestic card business periodend deposits increased in the quarter while average deposits were flat our percentage of fdic insured deposits ended the quarter at of total deposits we have provided additional details on deposit trends on slide in the appendix revenue in the linked quarter increased driven by both higher net interest and noninterest income noninterest expense increased in the quarter as higher marketing expense was partially offset by lower operating expense provision expense was billion with billion of net chargeoffs and an allowance build of million turning to slide ill cover the allowance balance in greater detail the million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to billion as of september the total company coverage ratio is now up basis points from the prior quarter ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide relative to last quarters assumptions underlying the allowance the baseline forecast in this quarter for most key economic variables improved however we continue to assume several key economic variables worsened from todays levels in our domestic card business the allowance balance increased by million the coverage ratio was largely flat at the predominant driver of the increased allowance was the growth in loans the positive impact from the modestly improved economic outlook was largely offset by the impact of replacing the lost content of the third quarter of with a 12month reasonable and supportable period that now includes the third quarter of in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance declined by million the improved economic outlook and a decline in loan balances drove the release and in our commercial banking business the allowance increased by million the build reflected the impact of rising interest rates and other factors on certain commercial real estate and corporate borrowers including our commercial office portfolio capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 on slide in the appendix we have included additional details on the office portfolio ill also note that in the third quarter we completed the sale of approximately million of loans from our commercial office portfolio that were previously marked as held for sale the coverage ratio in the commercial business increased by basis points and now stands at turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was up from last quarter and a year ago total liquidity reserves in the quarter were largely flat at billion higher cash balances were offset by a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio our cash position ended the quarter at approximately billion up about billion from the prior quarter turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our third quarter net interest margin was basis points higher than last quarter and basis points lower than the year ago quarter the quarteroverquarter increase in nim was largely driven by higher card yields a continued mix shift towards card loans and one additional day in the quarter partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at approximately basis points higher than the prior quarter net income in the quarter was partially offset by an increase in riskweighted assets common and preferred dividends and the share repurchases we completed in the quarter with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone slide shows third quarter results in our credit card business credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide the domestic card business posted another strong quarter of yearoveryear top line growth purchase volume for the third quarter was up from the third quarter of last year ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear and third quarter revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans revenue margin declined basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at the decline was driven by two factors first loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter this dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars but a headwind to revenue margin and second chargeoffs increased so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue these factors were partially offset by an increase in revolve rate on a linked quarter basis the revenue margin increased seasonally by basis points domestic card credit results continue to normalize from the historically strong results we saw during the pandemic consistent with our expectations the chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points year overyear to the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased basis points from the prior year to capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 on a sequential quarter basis the chargeoff rate was essentially flat and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points both the monthly delinquency rate and the monthly chargeoff rate are now modestly above levels our delinquencies are the best leading indicator of domestic card credit performance and the pace of delinquency rate normalization is slowing noninterest expense was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of total company marketing expense of million for the quarter was also relatively flat yearoveryear compared to the sequential quarter marketing increased our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation and our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business as a result we are leaning into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise as always were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks we expect fourth quarter marketing will be seasonally higher slide shows third quarter results for our consumer banking business in the third quarter auto originations declined yearoveryear driven by the decline in auto originations consumer banking ending loans decreased about billion or yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis ending loans were essentially flat we posted another strong quarter in yearoveryear retail deposit growth third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about billion or yearoveryear compared to the sequential quarter ending deposits were up about average deposits were up yearoveryear and up from the sequential quarter powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digital first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about yearoveryear driven by the higher rate paid on deposits and lower auto loan balances and margins noninterest expense was down about compared to the third quarter of lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear compared to the linked quarter the chargeoff rate was up basis points while the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points both of these linked quarter increases were better than typical seasonal expectations slide shows third quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances were essentially flat average loans were down about the decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit both ending deposits and average deposits were down about from the linked quarter consistent with the general trend weve seen for several quarters as we continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances third quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter noninterest expense was up about the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate for the third quarter declined basis points from the second quarter to the second quarter chargeoff rate was elevated by chargeoffs we recognized when we moved the portfolio of commercial office loans to held for sale we completed the sale of that portfolio in the third quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 slide of the third quarter results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio which is less than of our total loans the commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was up basis points compared to the linked quarter the criticized nonperforming loan rate was essentially flat at in closing we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter we posted another quarter of strong top line growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loans the pace of domestic card delinquency normalization slowed we grew consumer and total deposits and we added liquidity and capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet turning now to operating efficiency the third quarter operating efficiency ratio was particularly strong operating efficiency ratio can vary from quartertoquarter driven by the timing of revenue and operating expense we expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be modestly down compared to pulling way up our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses we are driving improvements in underwriting modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term we remain well positioned to deliver compelling longterm shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice president finance capital one financial corp thanks rich we will now start the qa session remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call amy please start the qa session capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so rich you noted several times that delinquency normalization has slowed it looked like september chargeoff performance was better than we would have expected but we are hearing from others that pressure is becoming broader in not just subprime but its also into prime so can you maybe just talk about what youre seeing within your portfolio what do you think about the pace of delinquency normalization and do you have any line of sight when you think losses will inevitably peak thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks ryan so lets just pull up on the metrics here our third quarter domestic card chargeoff rate was essentially flat from the prior quarter up basis points to our 30plus delinquency rate increased basis points from the prior quarter to both our losses and our delinquencies are modestly above their pre pandemic levels now lets talk about sort of whats happening at the margin here the trend of normalization in our credit metrics appears to be slowing in august and september the monthtomonth movement in our delinquencies was essentially in line with normal seasonality for the first time since normalization began weve also seen some stabilization in new delinquency entries relative to normal seasonal patterns so we are hopeful these stabilization trends continue now chargeoffs of course are a lagging metric so they have some months of catching up still to do in auto we have seen stabilization even longer our losses are modestly above prepandemic levels but moving in line with normal seasonality for the past few quarters so back to our card business for a moment theres another stabilization trend that we see as well which is our recovery rate our recovery rate had been falling for several years because of the low level of chargeoffs through the pandemic so weve had less inventory if you will to recover on and this was a larger effect for capital one than for most of our competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries so they come in over time and not all at once like in a debt sale weve now seen the recovery rate stabilize although it remains at unusually low levels now recoveries of capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 course dont impact our delinquencies but they are a pretty significant factor when in our chargeoffs and particularly when comparing our chargeoffs to prepandemic benchmarks now another capital one specific point here theres another factor sort of driving stabilization but this has been going on for a long time and thats the stability of credit performance in our recent origination vintages so looking ahead the economy is as always a source of uncertainty in our outlook we still expect the unemployment rate to worsen over the coming year and as always we remain very focused on resilience in our underwriting and making sure that we build a lot of resilience into all of our choices ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe rich as my followup question so andrew you had highlighted that the domestic card allowance was relatively stable and i think you gave three different factors maybe can you just remind us again what is included from a macro perspective in terms of unemployment and if i take what rich said regarding delinquency slowing and obviously chargeoffs catch up a little bit do you think were at the point where the replacement and the allowance is going to be less of a headwind going forward and we could now finally have the allowance build more closely following loan growth thank you andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure ryan so to your economic assumption point ill focus on unemployment rate although recall that a whole lot more is considered a whole bunch more variables but we are now assuming the unemployment rate moves into the mid by the middle of and basically hold there for a period of time but its not just the absolute level of unemployment as weve talked about before its also the change that influences underlying credit performance how that then plays through the allowance though like a number of factors are going into the allowance calculation as rich said the projected loss rates are going to be by far the biggest driver and as weve talked about many times delinquencies are the best leading indicator of credit performance particularly over the next couple of quarters and i wont go through the reasonable and supportable and reversion process elements that weve discussed previously but i will say beyond the credit forecast it is worth noting that the allowance framework considers a range of outcomes and uncertainties which are generally wider in periods of either worsening or improving transitions so at the core of your question even in a period where projected losses in future quarters may be lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines at least in the near term as we incorporate the related uncertainty into the allowance and so well go through our process as we do every year to take all of those factors into account and roll forward the allowance each quarter jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 operator our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi good afternoon and thank you for taking my question i was curious in terms of the health of the consumer i was curious if youre seeing trends at all diverge between higher fico and lower fico scores whether its on credit performance or spending as we go through the recovery richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes mihir thank you for your question so lets talk about credit performance when credit first started to normalize we called out that this trend was more pronounced at the lowend of the market whether defined by income or credit score and strikingly those were the segments that had improved the most early in the pandemic so this was not surprising to us later we observed that normalization was becoming more broadbased and in fact for many quarters now for several quarters now every segment was basically normalizing at about the same rate in other words if you look at for any segment where its credit metrics were relative to like its delinquencies for example relative to pre pandemic every segment was kind of on top of each other everything had caught up now we are seeing stabilization come more quickly at the lower end of the market in fact over the last few months our delinquencies in these segments have essentially stabilized on a seasonally adjusted basis and our upmarket segments are sort of just a little bit behind that so now i dont think this is necessarily a description of the marketplace per se this is what we see at capital one our performance has been assisted by some of the underwriting changes that we made over the past couple of years especially in response to credit to what we anticipated would be the impact of credit scores inflating fintechs flooding the market so as weve been talking about really for a couple of years now we in our originations and overall in our credit policy we were trimming around the edges for things that we saw or risks that we anticipated and this has contributed i think to strength and stability and performance thats now contributing to what we see here in terms of spend the spend is basically pretty when we look at spend per customer this has really moderated after the surge of spending coming out of the pandemic so yearoveryear and this is an overall capital one point yearoveryear spend growth per customer has been roughly flat for several months so the growth in spend that youre seeing in our metrics is really being driven by new account origination now with respect to the various segments the spend on the at the lower end of the marketplace is certainly probably the most moderated although it moderated first weve seen spend growth across our segments sort of fairly moderated but id say the biggest effect on the moderating side has been in the lower end of the market mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you thats quite helpful and then maybe just turning to nim very quickly can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on them in the nearterm particularly on the deposit competition side any thoughts on where deposit betas go what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint thank you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah with respect to beta as weve discussed in previous calls theres really a couple of key factors that are impacting betas the first is product mix sort of the rotation of customers across products and then the second is competitive pricing and within that i would include the notion of just deposit pricing lags that weve talked about and so for us the quarteroverquarter beta with that lag effect was something like our cumulative beta now stands at and so thats getting factored into nim as we look ahead on that dimension particularly assuming if rates do stay higher for longer i wouldnt be surprised if there continues to be some upward pressure on beta at least in the near term driven by those factors that i described the pricing and product mix piece so beyond that then in the nim we have seen spreads widen a bit mihir and wholesale funding costs are up a bit and i think rich talked about suppression in card but depending on the path of credit theres the potential at least for increased revenue suppression so i would lump all of those three things together as potential headwinds but from a tailwind perspective we can continue to see growth in card and particularly revolving card balances as a percent of the balance sheet like you saw this quarter and then the other thing that i would note even though cash balances remain elevated relative to historical standards i think we will see it settle out at a level thats higher than prepandemic but ultimately lower than where we are today as you look ahead over multiple quarters so those are really the primary factors that i would say are at play with respect to nim jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from arren cyganovich with citi your line is open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah just touching on the last discussion on net interest margin the card loan yields expanded i think basis points and that was quite a bit higher than the base rate expansion for the quarter you mentioned higher revolve rates is that part of what youre seeing there and how do the revolve rates compare today versus maybe where they were prepandemic andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes so part of it arren is just the fed if youre looking at yield as opposed to margin is you get a tailwind just from the fed rate changes but the other primary and larger factor than the fed changes is i would say largely seasonality which does wed typically see revolve rates in the third quarter just naturally be higher than they are throughout the year and we also tend to see a bit more on the late fee piece there so there is a seasonality dimension capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 in terms of where we are with revolve rates going forward ill let rich talk a little bit about the trends that were seeing in the portfolio richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes arren so overall in our domestic card business revolve rates are basically where they were so for example third quarter revolve rates right on top of third quarter but its sort of very different within segments the place that the revolve rate is quite a bit higher is in our partnerships business because we have the walmart portfolio we didnt have before the pandemic pretty much everywhere else across our branded book revolve rates are a little bit generally speaking a little bit to quite a bit lower than they were before but the net impression i would leave with you so our branded book overall is somewhat lower and the partnerships have offset that arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it and then on the marketing it looks like it was down just slightly yearoveryear still almost double where it was from a prepandemic perspective have you essentially hit kind of a almost a peak here in terms of marketing dollars and how do you think the expenses will go from there with respect to that richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay well arren on marketing so just pulling up total company marketing was up compared to the prior quarter and flat yearoveryear lets just pull up and talk about the big drivers of our marketing first we continue to really like the opportunities were seeing in the market including additional the opportunities that we get in expanding channels and growing the number of card products we have the benefit from our technology transformation that sort of is everywhere in what we do as we leverage more data were able to take advantage of powerful machine learning models create customized better experiences for consumers so that continues to have a lot of traction and we are leaning into that we also a very important part of our marketing spend and a thing were really leaning into is our focus on heavy spenders so when we think about our quest for heavy spenders it really goes back to when we launched our venture card and that was the beginning of a strategic push that we have continued and accelerated ever since and that involved more than just putting an attractive product out there heavy spenders of course to win with heavy spenders we need great servicing jawdropping customer experiences of course great value propositions and this takes a significant investment in upfront promotions and in marketing and in brand building and this is all about my observation all the years of doing this business and watching players who succeed here and those who get less traction is very much about a sustained investment and ultimately the brand that one builds so were continuing to invest also in building the properties and experiences to drive heavy spender growth at the top of the market so these investments include our travel portal access to exclusive properties and experiences airport lounges and capital one shopping capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 and our sustained investment at the top of the market has helped drive momentum overall in our spender business but weve grown even faster with the heaviest of spenders and we very much like this business in addition to the obvious spend growth were enjoying it generates strong revenues has very low losses low attrition and lifts the entire brand of the company the final factor driving our marketing levels is our investment in continuing to build our national bank and of course as we have a smaller branch footprint our growth is powered by modern technology compelling digital experience a cafe presence in heavily traveled locations across the nation and of course a sustained investment in marketing so these are the really compelling opportunities that are driving our marketing levels and we continue to see great traction pretty much across the boards and we continue to lean into these opportunities and its an important part of the creation of longterm value for our shareholders jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my question this afternoon id just like to talk a little bit about the depository franchise obviously theres been very strong growth this year in the consumer banking franchise particularly on the deposit side can you just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape rich you talked a little bit about the network the cafes the less concentrated branch approach but can you describe what youre seeing sort of broadly in the market and where you think youre gaining share richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well one of the thank you rick one of the core strategic approaches of capital one it really defines the founding idea of the company and pretty much all the choices weve made since is to look at the marketplace and the tsunami forces that are driving such change in the marketplace and really try to discern with all the noise in these marketplaces where is it that where is winning going to be whats the future of these things and almost always its a question of how technology is driving change and so in retail banking we of course entered banking way back in the mid oos driven most importantly by a desire to transform the balance sheet of our company to get away from capital market reliance and get not just a deposit driven balance sheet but an insured depositdriven balance sheet hence the quest for a consumer deposit franchise now along the way as a very important part of our strategy as well we look forward to trying to get at the forefront of where the world was going to go over time with respect to retail banking from a heavy reliance on branches and by the way i want to say at the outset i think branches will be an important thing in the in banking for as far out as we can see but you just cant help but see the evolution from the branch on the corner to the branch in your hand and really over time sorry to the bank in your hand to over time the bank in your life thats very digitally interactive and both reactively and proactively being there where a capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 consumer needs it on a realtime customized basis so thats where we have thats the vision that weve been working backwards from so in that journey the first step of course was building a national savings business that was absolutely central to our balance sheet strategy for the company but beyond that we have worked very much to build not just a national savings business but a national fullservice bank and to do that its not just a matter of sort of offering checking accounts but i think capital one was in a unique position having retail banks in branches in about of the nation and have a lot of experience with retail banking our view was if were going to win in national banking we actually have to digitize the entire customer experience and just about everything that you can get in a branch to be able to for customers to get that on a digital basis so what weve done over the years is build a full service digital national bank and we then as we have built this we have then leveraged the big customer base we have the national brand that we have and really added to our marketing and everywhere in our strategy the buildout of this national bank and were getting a lot of traction nice growth and a lot of traction on the brand side as consumers realize that capital one even though they dont have branches across the nation really is a full service national bank so thats been our strategy for years we continue to its an important thing that we lean into from a marketing point of view but basically our quest is to build continue to build a national bank without getting there by virtue of just lots and lots of acquisitions of branchbased banks richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you rich jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes rich i was wondering given your good trends in auto delinquency are you sort of inclined to be leaning a little harder into auto lending or do you need to see something before making that decision richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp don thank you for your question its funny we have zigged while others have zagged for so long as long as i can remember in the auto business and our strategy isnt just as zig while others zag its always to look at this marketplace and really objectively see where the opportunities are this is a more volatile business in terms of our growth strategies than the credit card business is because of the role that a dealer plays in the business in a sense holding auctions at the dealership such that we our growth strategies are particularly sensitive to the credit and underwriting choices that our competitors make because its sort of amplified in this auctionbased environment with dealers really quite a contrast from the credit card business where certainly the competitive choices matter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 but its really still a oneonone business with our customers and prospective customers thats why you see so much more stability in the marketing and the marketing sort of and the and leaning into the growth that you see on the card side so as when you think about the last few years so we certainly had in the last five or six years tremendous growth and traction in the auto business and we our strategy was so powered by our technology that weve invested in the business the data the underwriting capabilities and the very deep relationships that weve been building with dealers over the last couple of years we were concerned at what was happening with margins as they were pressured by interest rate increases in and early some competitors were slow to adjust their pricing now more recently industry lending margins have largely normalized as interest rates have stabilized and many players including late movers have continued to increase pricing the other thing of course was watching very closely the credit side of the business and just as we did in the card business probably actually more proactively and more significantly in auto we trimmed back around the edges in anticipation of certain worsening and with concerns about score drift in with respect to the data from consumers so that has and youve seen the data that where capital one has pulled back quite a bit our outstandings have been shrinking a little bit you also have seen the striking credit performance weve had and the stability now that is at least two quarters long in terms of what were seeing on various credit metrics so seeing the good metrics and seeing the marketplace were certainly on the lookout for opportunities but im not here to predict an acceleration but we certainly do like the performance of both our front book and our back book at this point donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks first question just on the adjusted operating efficiency rate weve seen some nice improvements over the last two quarters and i know rich you talked about sort of the year outlook im just wondering if we could see this type of level or trends sustain itself into next year richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp sanjay were not going to be giving out guidance on at this point on where operating efficiency goes we certainly are pleased with the progress that weve made over time in operating efficiency ratio even as weve continued to really invest in the business and were starting to see we have these two competing things going on inside capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 capital one both a real investment in technology and also at the same time generating a bunch of benefits and efficiencies from that technology so the net result of these two things has been weve been able to really make tremendous strides forward in technology and also get some efficiencies along the way i wouldnt put too much reliance on any one quarter you know these numbers kind of bounce around but certainly you probably noticed that in our guidance we had guidance of flat to modestly down with respect to our efficiency ratio for full year and we took the flat part out and were now just at modestly down so we continue to believe over the long term that our technology transformation offers a lot of promise for operating efficiencies and delivering operating efficiency is an important part of i think the value creation equation for investors i do want to say though at the same time we continue to really see great opportunities in the business we continue to still invest in technology to capitalize on even greater opportunities over time and thats the story of our operating efficiency ratio sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect then a followup question just on the leaning into growth in card where exactly is that happening i mean obviously you talked about adjusting the risk parameters and thats obviously flowing through in the credit numbers improving is it more on the transactor side that youre leading into growth or is it balanced across all segments im just curious on sort of the implications on a go forward basis thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah thank you so we are finding traction across the spectrum really so and were leaning in across the spectrum one thing i do want to say about growth the outstandings growth if we really think about just the strength of loan growth for a while the striking loan growth for capital one and the industry was we all said well this is just reversing the pullbacks from the pandemic but i think for us and for a lot of players in the industry these loan numbers have blown past prior levels and lets just reflect a little bit on what has sustained this my view is well theres the capital one effect we continue to have significant new account growth and that obviously powers a lot of over time loan growth payment rates are coming down interestingly they have come down quite a bit but as a general statement theyre not down to where they were before part of thats mix effect at capital one because weve had a lot of traction on the spending side but even within segments if i were to generalize payment rates the payment rates are still higher than they were prepandemic so again inside that theres partly a capital one effect but i think also sort of a strength of the consumer effect however the payment rates have come down somewhat and that has powered growth and i think likely no ones going to be able to prove this but i think there are inflation effects underneath the surface when things cost more as long as consumer incomes stay up to where inflation is you generally have some natural i think inflation effects that drives some of this growth as well so we see a lot of strength there and some of those are capital one specific comments im making and several of those are really kind of industry points capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good afternoon on the back to your commentary around the slowing pace of the increase in delinquencies that youre seeing in card and some of the stabilization that youre citing i know you indicated that chargeoffs indiscernible of course lagged that can you give us maybe some way to think about how long that lag could be is it a two to threequarter type of window that were looking for losses to follow through on that front thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well i dont want to make a precise prediction on that i want to first of all pull up and say the thing that we tell everybody to look at is what we say is what we look at is delinquencies because that is the first indicator thats why we have been talking not just quarterly but really even looking at the last couple of months and seeing sort of more stabilization on the credit card side which is very encouraging delinquencies basically customers go delinquent and ultimately charge off six months later and so there is but sometimes they go faster sometimes they go slower and of course lots of times they make their payments but were talking about these things being measured in over a couple of quarters the relationship between the delinquencies and the chargeoffs jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes i hate to reask this question but i think a lot of investors want to make a fine point on this in the fourth quarter going back to ryan and johns question about net chargeoffs i think that perhaps whats holding back credit sensitive financials is obviously the prospect of recession but rich everything that youve said has seen positive pace of delinquency rate normalization slowing stability of credit performance in recent vintages as we think about what happened in september in terms of the card chargeoff rate and look at the quarterly chargeoff rate in third quarter and second quarter is it fair to draw the conclusion that as we look forward to the fourth quarter net chargeoff rate that given the stability of all the leading indicators that the chargeoff rate will be mostly driven by seasonality rather than normalization if normalization has stabilized for now richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 yeah so erika thanks for your question let me say a few things so first of all one of the things that makes this already challenging business for everyone studying it including those of us who live it every day is the seasonality in the volatility which a big element of that is seasonality so lets talk just a little bit about seasonality card and auto delinquencies tend to improve each year around the tax refund season and then they worsen gradually over the rest of the year second quarter is typically the seasonal low point for card delinquencies and q4 is the seasonal high point card losses lag relative to delinquencies so they tend to be seasonally lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter and now in the third quarter so our domestic card delinquencies increased so its kind of interesting that were talking about sort of a leveling a stabilizing kind of direction when were actually looking at delinquencies for the quarter that went up basis points on a sequential quarter basis and thats versus a typical seasonal expectation of kind of sort of somewhere in the neighborhood of like basis points so you can even see for the quarter that most of the increase that we observed was seasonal but then thats where weve said if you zoom into the months of august and september the monthovermonth movement is getting really close to just the normal seasonal trend and so this is one of the early indications that the trend of normalization weve been seeing may be stabilizing now one thing i want to say obviously you hear a bullish man in my commentary im not here to just wave my arms and declare a turn we have a couple of months of very encouraging data wed love to see more data where we have seen a couple of quarters where weve seen a longer stretch of data is more on the lower end of the card business interestingly as i talked about and in the auto business so thats where things have really kind of appear to have stabilized our upmarket card business is getting there a little bit not quite there yet so i start by saying wed love to see a little more data to be fully confident of what were seeing the second thing i want to say then now to your question about chargeoffs first of all what we see especially in the months of august and september youre not going to see that show up with stabilized chargeoffs as soon as the fourth quarter because it really is a couple of quarters that to the earlier question that was asked its really a couple of quarters before the chargeoffs performed sort of in line with the delinquencies so were not going to make predictions here and i dont i just i always were always very kind of try to be as clear as we can on what we see we happen to see some pretty positive things here but they can also be a head fake and not be as good as they appear jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 hey good afternoon thanks so much for taking my questions when you think about capital ratios and basel endgame and the need to build capital specifically for unused lines how do you think about mitigating if at all mitigating your unused lines and given your capital target of about today maybe you could just talk to us about the factor of basel unused lines and the effect going forward on your capital levels and the rotce target and then i just have a followup if you dont mind thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes im going to come back dominick to the last half of your question i wasnt sure i followed it but in terms of unused lines one of our longstanding strategies has been to start people with smaller lines and allow them to grow and so i would say i wouldnt expect a meaningful shift in that strategy solely in the service of riskweighted assets so overall though as you look at the risk weightings that have come out in the endgame proposal for us in aggregate recall were not in mortgage or trading so looking at the net of retail and commercial inclusive of the gold plating those are largely fighting to a draw in terms of overall riskweighting impact specifically on the asset side like everyone else of course were going to have an impact from the operational risk rwa but i didnt quite follow the second half of your question around rotces could you just repeat that for me dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc sure sorry about that i was just curious if you basically had to hold more capital because its my understanding that you would have to hold additional capital against unused lines versus just drawn lines now and so i was just curious if your capital ratio would have to rise and if that would affect the longterm return on like return on in any way andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp got it yes sorry i didnt quite follow the second half of it yeah that was what i was trying to explain in my answer is the net of all of that ultimately ends up being a wash the part where we will be holding more capital on the denominator side strictly for the riskweighting assets again i should highlight that its in a comment period a lot of industry focus on it and well particularly as it relates to the op risk calculation there could be material impacts on the final outcome relative to whats proposed but taking what is currently proposed the asset side specifically outside of the operational risk ends up being roughly a draw for us and its really just the operational risk thats going to require us to hold more capital jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp dominick do you have a followup next question please operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is open jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp you there bill capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc can you hear me richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes we can hear you bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay great thank you yes so i wanted to ask about the late fee proposal the consensus view is that well get it very soon itll be immediately litigated can you give us your view on the likely path that you would anticipate and possibly speak to any potential costs that might be associated with it richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thank you bill so the cfpbs late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately and while the cfpbs proposal has not yet been finalized we expect the cfpb to publish a proposal soon probably before the end of the year now once the cfpb publishes its final rule we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of this rule and this litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of and maybe longer if the proposed rule is implemented there will be a significant impact to our pl in the nearterm however we have a set of mitigating actions that were working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect these choices include changes to our policies products and investment choices some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect many will come after the rule change takes effect jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please next question please operator one moment please our final question is a followup from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey sorry about that i think i got cut off can you hear me okay richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes we can dominick andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 we can dominick dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc all right sorry about that guys i was actually just curious on the quarteroverquarter increase in domestic card yield i know that theres sometimes some seasonality in the third quarter and weve also had a lot of rate hikes in previous years around the third quarter i was wondering if you could just walk us through some of the dynamics in the quarteroverquarter increase in domestic card thanks so much andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes dominick i cant remember who asked it earlier but just reiterating some of those points i think you largely answered your own question which is there is seasonality that in part is or is a function of the revolve rates driven by some of the dynamics rich talked about over the course of the year we did see the fed move and then we also saw a bit of late fees which i would lump into the seasonality dimension and then finally we had one more day in the third quarter so day count in an absolute sense not necessarily relative to peers which i think was the nature of the question earlier but at least in an absolute sense those are the big drivers of what drove the quarteroverquarter yield jeff norris senior vice president finance capital one
