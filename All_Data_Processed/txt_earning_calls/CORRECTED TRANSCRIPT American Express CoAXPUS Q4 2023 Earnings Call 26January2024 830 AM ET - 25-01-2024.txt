pandemic in january of we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth and we set an aspiration to sustain growth over the longer term at levels that were higher than what we were achieving prior to

around the world and the american express colleagues who support them today we are a larger and stronger company since weve delivered record annual revenues increasing the scale of our business by over in just two years from billion to billion in annual revenues annual card spending over this period has increased on an fxadjusted basis to a record trillion weve added about million new

in the us came from this cohort at the same time retention continues to be very high and our credit metrics remain strong and bestinclass these strong results reflect the success of our strategic investments weve made in our business along with the tremendous earnings power of our business model looking ahead let me tell you why i feel really good about our future prospects we have a business model that is delivering premium performance and we have strong momentum which is driven by four key features of our model that differentiate us from the competition and are difficult to replicate first our economic construct has a set of diversified revenue sources that include card fees spending and best inclass lending with our subscriptionlike card fees being a core and fastgrowing component of our revenue mix we have a singular focus on premium customers and superior innovative value propositions our premium customers are high spending loyal and drive our strong credit

advantages giving us the runway for continuing our momentum across generations geographies and both our consumer and small business customers the power of our business model combined with the global scale of our premium customer base the dedication and focus of our talented colleagues and the attractiveness of the many growth opportunities we see ahead are the key reasons why im confident in our ability to continue on our growth plan and its why going forward well remain focused on our longterm aspiration of delivering annual revenue growth of plus and midteens eps growth we believe this aspiration is the right one and we aim to achieve it every year however we manage the company for the longterm and we anticipate there will be a range of potential outcomes in any given year due to a variety of factors such as external environment and actions we might take that we decide are best for the business looking at this year the continued momentum weve seen in the business as weve executed our strategy gives us confidence in our guidance for which is in line with our longterm aspiration for the year we expect to deliver annual revenue growth between and and fullyear eps of to american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 in addition we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to a share up from beginning with the first quarter dividend declaration this represents more than a increase in the dividend from when we introduced our growth plan in january of as always well continue to run our business for the longterm and well do that by listening to our customers and meeting their needs through innovative unique value propositions and exceptional service that reflects our brand built on trust and security delivered and supported by a worldclass colleague base in keeping our focus on backing our customers and our colleagues we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis over the long term thank you and let me now turn it over to christophe christophe le caillec chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our results which reflect another strong year of performance and to lay out our expectations for i will discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning since its ph yearend and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we run the company starting with our summary financials on slide fullyear revenues reached an alltime high of billion up on an fxadjusted basis our fourth quarter revenues were billion and grew yearoveryear this revenue momentum drove reported fullyear net income of billion and earnings per share of for the quarter we reported net income of billion and earnings per share of lets now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results beginning with billed business on slide we reached record levels of spending for both the full year and the fourth quarter in total billed business grew versus last year on an fxadjusted basis in the fourth quarter billed business grew as we continued to see more stable growth rates after lapping the prioryear impact of omicron back in the first quarter this growth rate does reflect a bit of softening versus last quarter but i would point out that the number of transactions from our card members continues to grow double digits yearoveryear a good indicator of the engagement of our customer base our growth was driven by growth in goods and services spending and although slower than last quarter continued strong growth in travel and entertainment spending up for the quarter restaurant spending remains our largest te category and reached billion for the full year for the first time while airline spending growth slowed in the quarter there are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses starting with our largest segment on slide us consumer grew billings up this quarter we continue to see growth across all generations and age cohorts with millennials and gen z customers again driving our highest billed business growth within this segment their spending was up this quarter looking at commercial services on slide overall growth came in at this quarter consistent with last quarters growth rate spending growth from our us small and medium size enterprise customers remain modest given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years specifically in we saw a large increase in organic spending as businesses restocked their inventories following supply chain issues during the pandemic this caused a significant grow over challenge with spending from this segment in the industry in importantly we continue to see strong levels of demand for new accounts high levels of retention and strong credit performance on our small business products looking ahead this positions us well for the future as spending growth rebounds american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 and lastly on slide you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services we continue to see double digit growth across all regions and customer types spending from international consumers and from international sme and large corporate customers each grew in the fourth quarter overall while were seeing a softer spend environment we are pleased with the continued strong engagement and loyalty of our card members across the globe as we think about we are assuming a spend environment similar to what weve seen in the past few quarters now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide we saw yearoveryear growth of we expect this growth which has been elevated versus prepandemic levels to continue to moderate as we progress through the but to still grow modestly faster than billings turning next to credit and provision on slide through first and most importantly we continue to see strong and bestinclass credit metrics we attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base our robust risk management practices and our disciplined growth strategy as we had expected our writeoff and delinquency rates did continue to tick up this quarter as you see on slide going forward we expect to see these delinquency and writeoff rates remain strong with modest increases in turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide the modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate combined with the quarteroverquarter growth in our loan balances resulted in a million reserve build this reserve build combined with net writeoffs drove billion of provision expense in the fourth quarter as you see on slide we ended the fourth quarter with billion of reserves representing of our total loans and card member receivables and continuing to reflect the premium nature of our card member base this reserve rate remains about basis points below the level we had prepandemic or day cecl we continue to expect the reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through similar to the modest increases weve seen over the past few quarters moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the fourth quarter and up for the full year on an fxadjusted basis our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in q4 and for the full year as you can see on slide this growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear in the fourth quarter and for the full year as you can see on slide as we expected growth continued to moderate a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year reflecting our cycle of product refreshes in we expect to exit the year with some further momentum compared to the current growth supported by continued product innovation and our focus on premium value propositions we currently have plans to refresh around products globally next year in the quarter we acquired million new cards and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new card members continue to look strong moving on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis in q4 and for the full year this growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year when you think about you should expect to see net interest income growth moderate as balance growth moderates with some continued tailwind from our tenured customers american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 continuing to rebuild balances and i would remind you that for our business model we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from lower interest rate environment next year to sum up revenues on slide the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum looking forward into we expect to see revenue growth between and moving to expenses on slide overall total expenses were up in the fourth quarter and on a fullyear basis both growing significantly lower than revenue this expense growth reflects the strong growth we are seeing in our business the investments weve made as well as our continued focus on expense discipline starting at the top of the page with variable customer engagement expenses these costs came in at of total revenues for the fourth quarter and for the full year i would note that this cost came in a bit lower than our expectations reflecting some of the natural hedges in our model as te spend growth slowed a bit in the quarter we saw lower rewards costs than we had expected for example a lower mix of redemptions for airlines tickets and fewer points earned on airline spend in i would expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our card members on the marketing line we invested around billion in the fourth quarter and billion for the full year this is a bit below last year and our expectations to have marketing spend at around billion marketing expense came in lower than we expected for the quarter reflecting lower demand given the softer te environment however we saw demand increase as we move through the quarter and we continue to plan for increased marketing spend in were confident that with our sophisticated acquisition engine well do so in an efficient way moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the fourth quarter and billion for the full year this was above our original expectations driven by a few notable items in the quarter first as part of the normal course of business we set up a reserve to cover expenses as we continuously look to enhance the organizations effectiveness we also set up a reserve for exposure to a specific merchant and like many others we were impacted by the devaluation of the argentine peso which increased our opex in q4 by million looking forward we continue to see opex as a key source of leverage and our focus on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done in we expect operating expenses to be fairly flat to this years expense we will of course continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year and our flexible model will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed taking everything into account in we expect total expense to grow mid to high level digits for the full year as we expect to drive continued leverage through our operating expenses turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in including billion in the fourth quarter on the back of strong earnings generation we ended the year with our cet1 ratio at within our target range of to in q1 as steve discussed we expect to increase our dividend by over to per quarter consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings and our to target payout ratio we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generated while supporting our balance sheet growth we do not expect any material nearterm changes to our capital management approach that brings me to our longterm aspiration and guidance on slide we continue to run our business with a focus on our aspiration of revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth and we believe that its the right aspiration as steve discussed for the full year specifically we are introducing our guidance of american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 having revenue growth of to and earnings per share between and this guidance remains in line with our aspiration and also factors in a range of scenarios based on what were seeing in our business today we also recently announced an agreement to sell our certified business our guidance and the items related to that i just walked through do not include the potential impact from this sale we do expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business as weve done with similar transactions in the past we expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide more detail then with that ill turn the call back over to kartik to open the call to your questions kartik ramachandran senior vice president head of investor relations american express co thank you christophe before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning good to see the eps guidance and rev guidance i guess on january spend some of your peers have noted a slowdown on weather can you comment on that and then just maybe talk a little bit about billed business in in terms of sme christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so we dont talk about monthly numbers so let alone about a few weeks into the month of january so i think best is to wait until the end of the quarter and well provide a lot more color and detail on the billing in january so far as far as how we think about billed business in our planning assumption is that we should expect or were expecting billings to be consistent with what weve seen in the prior few quarters and were ready to seeing upside there is some but for now thats the assumption weve baked into our plans and how we constructed this guidance on the sme side its the same assumption if you want we are assuming something similar to what were seeing in q3 q4 and we are very focused on winning the recoveries with smes as i said in my remarks these card members have been through a lot over the last two three years and we are focusing on providing the best experience the best products were focusing on acquiring as many customers as we can and helping them grow their business and well be ready when theyre ready historically this has been a volatile segment for us you know how dynamic these customer segments are and we play a critical role in that industry and well be ready when theyre ready american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 operator thank you the next question is coming from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe to build on dons question can you maybe just dig a little bit deeper on some of the drivers of revenue growth so discount revenues card fees nii christophe i know you said that nii should decelerate and are we assuming any sort of reacceleration as we move through the year particularly in areas like us consumer or sme thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co hey good morning ryan thank you for your question so the building blocks of the revenue growth remain the same at a very high level we expect billing and therefore discount revenue to grow at a pace similar to what weve seen in the recent quarters we expect card fees so q4 is at full year at we expect card fees to be a key contributor to growth going forward to remain a key contributor to growth going forward and actually to exit q4 at a higher level than where we are right now and i gave you the context in my remarks very much supported by the constant strength in premium acquisition the product refresh and renewals that we are committed to execute on and very strong retention rates which we have experienced for many years now and when it comes to the last component of our revenue pool net interest income you should expect that growth rate to moderate very much driven by the fact that and youve seen the trend im sure ryan the asset growth and their lending growth rate have been moderating over the past quarters and we expect that moderation to continue the very strong growth was a function of tenured card members rebuilding balances postcovid and at some stage were going to reach a more normal rate there and that will naturally drive nii to a more moderate level of growth ive got to also mention that we believe that the interest rate dynamic in what the fed will design doesnt play a big role here in terms of whats going to happen to nii and when you put all of this together and you can we run multiple scenarios what if billing is a bit stronger what if nii is a bit weaker and we land in the same range of to so thats very much how we think about the revenue guidance operator thank you the next question is coming from mark devries of deutsche bank please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks i was hoping you could dig a little further into kind of where the loan growth is coming from how much of it is from new customers or relatively recently added customers versus older and gaining share there and also whether youre seeing any kind of difference in credit performance on kind of balances from newer customers versus older christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co okay so let me take loan growth first the dynamic on loan growth has not changed and for several quarters now its also our philosophy in how we run the company about of the loan growth comes from tenured card members and what we call tenured card members is card members who have been with us more than months and thats very much how we think about acquisition we acquire card members we develop relationships with them then we offer them we crosssell products we increase the lines we nurture those relationships and we do that because we understand them better we understand their spend patterns and they understand our products better as well and thats the driver we dont do much balance transfers if any at all and we dont have promotional offers much promotional offers also so its very much growing with our tenured card members and its part of our strategy to contain if you want the credit risk and to control it and when it comes to the credit profile of the new card members we havent changed our credit underwriting models right and we havent changed as well our marketing channels and products while we still skew towards positive selection in terms of credit profile that has not changed and i need to say that the prospects that we bring in and become recent card members have very good credit profile operator thank you the next question is coming from bill carcache of wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my question good morning i wanted to followup on your comments about customer engagement spending outpacing revenue growth can you speak broadly to your ability to continue to drive customer engagement with elevated investment spending while at the same time offsetting that margin pressure with operating expense leverage in other parts of the business and i guess do you anticipate positive operating leverage on an aggregate basis with revenue growth outpacing the sum of that customer engagement and operating expense combined christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co theres a lot here so let me first take you through customer engagement the key thing for us and you heard us say this for years right we build premium products and we price for that value you heard us say as well that over the last years the mix of the portfolio shifted more towards premium products that premiumization of the portfolio is the key driver behind that ratio of variable customer engagement expenses to revenue the more platinum card members we bring the more variable customer engagement expenses you should expect to see but at the same time we have a lot of initiatives to actually optimize this we have a lot of innovation in that space im going to share with you one that is driving a lot of efficiencies for us american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 we recently introduced their pay with point option where you can actually go in the app or the website select one specific transaction and pay with points so we have that constant innovation to try to delight the customers make their life easier and at the same time create efficiencies in terms of the weighted average cost per point specifically in q4 one of the driver of that efficiency or that variable card member engagement expense was the fact that we saw less point redemption with airline tickets which is one of the most expensive cost per point that we have that drove some efficiencies in that metric we also saw as there was some softness in some te categories less point accelerators earned and that created as well some efficiencies there the reason why im pointing that out is just to give you some examples of some of the natural hedges that exist in our business model where when you see a little bit of softness in the top line that creates some savings as well in some expense lines so we guided towards a little bit of an increase in terms of the variable card member engagement expenses and were going to keep monitoring that but i feel good about that trend and i think that that margin is still very strong and able to generate very strong earnings were committed to containing opex and as i said we expect operating expenses to be about flat to where we are ending and marketing expenses will dial up or down based on opportunities that we see based on the efficiencies that we create as well the model works really well as you can see and im comfortable that the model is strong and we are stress testing that model running multiple scenarios and it works well in terms of its ability to generate earnings over time and i would say risk adjusted earnings because that powerful model what we pay on variable card member engagement expenses comes back with a multiple on the credit line we attract positive select we generate positive select we attract premium card members who have very strong credit profile and i like paying for that as opposed to trying to control the credit risk down the road operator thank you the next question is coming from jeff adelson of morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thank you for taking my questions chris and steve just wanted to dig into the softer te trends a little bit it looks like youre seeing some softness particularly in airline spend youre seeing some slower point redemptions for tickets there just maybe give us some insight into what youre hearing and seeing from your card members on that front and then just maybe in the forward look can you help us understand what youre kind of embedding in your expectations for te from here i think in the past youve talked about how the booking trends have been a pretty good indicator of whats to come maybe any comment on what youre seeing there stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so te sequentially the growth rate came down i need to point out though that its still up yearover year so its a pretty strong growth rate in terms of airline spend and if you heard im sure the various airlines they all made comments about a bit of a softer demand and since many of those customers are using an american express card to pay for their airline ticket we saw a similar trend this being said booking remains very strong on our tls segment i dont have the numbers in front of me but i know they were strong so i dont well see whether its the beginning of a trend or whether its a data point but we keep seeing a lot of strength and the partnership we have with delta is working very very well originations of new cards are very strong and card members decided to redeem a bit less in q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past and weve seen that choppiness as well in the past i dont worry its one data point and for we american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 havent communicated on exactly what assumptions were making by category but im not too worried we have a card member base that loves traveling and im sure theyre going to keep traveling operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions this morning look you guys had alluded to the fact that the reserve rate is going to go up or drift up in im curious if whats driving that presumably its a mix shift between loans and card member receivables but im wondering if at any level youre also suggesting that the reserve rate on the loan portfolio is going to go up as a reflection of either of some sort of shift there or is it just pure mix shift as the loan portfolio grows faster than the card member receivables christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so thank you rick for your question so this is very this is an important point so im glad youre asking the question the first thing i want to say is that the absolute levels when you look at the delinquency rates or the writeoff rates are very low in terms of our historical performance and on the slide i put as well their pre pandemic levels the writeoff rate is in q4 it was prepandemic right so were still below where we were prepandemic so in absolute theyre very low relative to our peers which i know you know well theyre also very good and im sure you know that that every competitor or peer reported their numbers and experienced the same tick but at a higher magnitude our tick up of basis point is one of the lowest in the industry so i feel good about where we are and i feel good about the trend when it comes to the dynamic in the portfolio the key driver behind this is that theres still some normalization going on here we are moving from sub writeoff rate during the pandemic as you all know on this call this was not a sustainable level and base rates are normalizing and they are normalizing at a slow pace and i like that and the is again a place where i feel comfortable from a credit standpoint the other thing to expand a little bit and take a step back in terms of what kind of loan growth we are seeing the biggest contributors in terms of loan balances are their pay over time facility that we offered with our charge products and their cobrands cards and so both those portfolio have very strong credit profile and better credit profile than what we call internally proprietary lending which includes blue cash everyday for instance so if anything the profile of the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio is shifting and evolving more towards product that have a strong credit profile and high velocity this being said that normalization is happening and thats whats creating that little pickup and as i said in my comments were not quite done with that normalization theres still a bit more to come in our minds but not a lot operator thank you the next question is coming from saul martinez of hsbc please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hey good morning thanks for taking my question maybe ill just ask on capital is there any updated thoughts on how youre thinking about basel end game obviously your preliminary expectations of the proposal at least are that it would take you down to closer to but there is a lot of talk about that being softened just how are american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 you thinking about capital management you obviously increased your dividend but how are you thinking about buybacks going forward in light of the uncertainty christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so thank you for your question so not a lot has changed on that front outside of the fact that weve been meeting with regulators steve met with regulators i met with regulators as well and what i can tell you is that they are listening theyre engaged and i think they understand our comments the ball is back in their camp now and theyre incorporating all the comments they received from the industry and im sure youve seen a lot of those comments as well so they have a lot of work to do right now we are in waiting mode and i think were expecting the current estimate is were expecting their or at least their next version of the rules by the end of well see it took years to get to their first draft so well see when we get the next version im not too concerned i feel good about our starting point and our capital position as you know we generate about return on equity which means that we generate a ton of capital and for now were not going to change our capital policy the first thing we do is of course fund the balance sheet then we distribute dividends we feel very confident about the increase that we are planning to do this year and the rest is going to go in share buybacks so that we keep capital between and of our risk weighted asset and thats what weve done for years thats what were going to keep doing and were going to adapt to the basel rule you know were running the company conservatively as well with a big buffer over their rate that we have and so nothing has changed much on that front so more to come when we get the final rules operator thank you the next question is coming from moshe orenbuch of td cowen please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks and many of my questions have been asked and answered but hoping to follow up on a comment that you had just made about the pay over time business could you talk a little bit more about the characteristics of that you mentioned that obviously thats going to tenured charge card customers so the quality is very strong just talk a little bit about the yield and how much youve seen and kind of growth from that product stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so your description is correct moshe there its a facility that we attach to our charge card products where they can decide if they want to revolve proportion of their bill this is the fastest growing category for us in terms of loan growth it was very well received it was very well received by the card members and i dont know what else i can tell you remember that their charge card has a no preset limit which is an important feature here so its a way for us to give them as well and its a paid for product so its a way for us to give them a facility where they can revolve over a period of time and as i said previously their credit profile is very strong on this product very much because it is attached to a very premium base right premium gold card members are using this facility and revolving from timetotime operator thank you the next question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you maybe i could ask the questions regarding whats embedded in the revenue growth expectations for differently if we look at the fourth quarter exit run rate would that sort of target us to the low end of the guidance range and then christophe you mentioned that lower rates shouldnt help but arent you guys liability sensitive on the charge card portfolio thanks christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so let me take the second question first we are slightly liability sensitive and the key assumption for us the comment remains that in its totality our total balance sheet and total funding stack level the impact of rate cuts is going to be very small to our nii the big unknown here is whats going to happen to the beta weve been as an industry trending around on the way up were probably going to trend to on the way down but not immediately and its hard to say exactly at this point in time where were going to be when the fed starts cutting rates we are making assumptions that we think are conservative but we dont know for sure and well see where we are so theres a bit of uncertainty here but what you know for sure is that you should not expect a big impact to our nii depending on the rate curve going back to your first question around revenue i just i dont have a lot to say on top of what i said earlier and what i said in my prepared remarks im happy to be surprised on the upside if bill business is stronger card fees we have good visibility nii i think the trend is very established and on billing as i said we are assuming at this point in time something consistent with what weve seen in the previous quarters and well see where we are at the end of the year but if the economy rebounds if the growth is a bit stronger than what is expected by economists then our card members are optimistic and keep spending id be delighted to have a higher bill business to report operator thank you the next question is coming from dominick gabriele of oppenheimer co please go ahead dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hey good morning steve and christophe thanks so much for taking my question i was just curious about the total card growth we all know that youve seen some really excellent account acquisitions over the last number of years but i was just curious about total card growth versus proprietary cardsinforce growth particularly this quarter if theres any color you can provide on why that may diverge or what the strategy is between maybe having more proprietary cards as a percentage of total cards anything on that would be excellent thanks so much christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so we have about million cards that transact on our network out of the million cards about million are issued by american express thats what we call the proprietary cards they represent the bulk of the spend and they drive the very vast majority of our economics american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 from a growth rate standpoint if you look at cardsinforce and youll see that in the details of our disclosures the proprietary cardsinforce of yearoveryear and the total cardsinforce so including the cards issued by network partners is up does that answer your question dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc very much i really appreciate that have a good day christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from arren cyganovich of citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks maybe i was wondering if you could talk about the plans for the next platinum refresh in the us i think the last one was done and whether or not you have any plans to do that this year and if thats in your guidance for the year as well stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so as you know we have committed to refreshing products this year as christophe had said and strategically we look at refreshing all of our products on a sort of to 4year basis and its important because its really important to make sure that we keep our products fresh were listening to our customers and putting in those enhancements and the extra value that they want and enables us to make sure from a generational perspective we are modifying those products as trends change and as our customer needs change as far as specifically for the platinum card we dont really preannounce that and so i think you just have to wait and see operator thank you the next question is coming from craig maurer of ft partners please go ahead craig maurer q analyst ft partners good morning thanks two quick questions considering the strength of delta airlines over the last number of years its consistently the top airline youve clearly benefited a lot from that in terms of new card issuance and likely spend as theyve been able to hold fares better as we see airline spend slow does that benefit diminish and is it something you have to think about and second in terms of small business weve been pretty flat now for a couple quarters curious what youre seeing under the covers there is this are you still able to issue new cards or and are you seeing any reluctance from small business to take additional products that might increase their cost beyond the baseline im just trying to understand the mood better of small business owners thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 so from a small business perspective the drive is really organic spend were not seeing existing small businesses spend more than they spent the year before and thats not an american express phenomenon that is an industry phenomenon as far as card acquisition within small businesses that still remains strong as far as small businesses looking at our platform and looking at our loans and so forth that remains strong and the credit quality remains strong i think as christophe said in his remarks there is this phenomenon of inventory buildup some interest rate shock and so forth and so small businesses tend to be very very secular i would be much more concerned if we werent acquiring cards if we werent engaging in new small businesses or if writeoffs and delinquencies were higher so at the moment as we look at this we truly believe this is an organic spending issue and its not american express specific ill let christophe talk a little bit about delta christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so the delta product is still going very very strong the total billing growth on the delta product for the full year was up and we are originating a lot of new cards as well my comment about their softness in terms of q4 hard to say whether its the beginning of a trend or whether its just a blip time will tell but its still going very very strong and the engagement with the partner is very strong the partnership is going strong so i dont see any softness there at all and i will say as well that the credit quality of those new card members remain very strong i made comments about its one of the fastest growing segment on the loan side and it comes with very strong performance people who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality and we see that on the loan side on the spend side on the origination side so im not worried about that at this stage operator thank you our final question will come from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi thank you for squeezing me in here i just wanted to go back a little bit and maybe just unpack the billings growth a little bit maybe can you just talk about how much of that is being driven by adding new card members versus winning wallet share and then just related to that same topic just how are you thinking about the environment for new card acquisitions is this million level that youve been at for the last couple of quarters the right level to think about for the next year i understand that its dynamic and youll change but what have you assumed in your planning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co let me talk about sort of card acquisition numbers when we go out and we look at acquiring card members we really focus on acquiring billed business and we acquire revenue and consistently now if you take the first quarter out of last year where it was a little bit more of an anomaly of million cards weve been around that million to million and we will as long as we have line of sight into a high credit quality premium card members we will continue to be out there aggressively acquiring card members and that range will be where we see that range today between million million and we dont really provide any guidance on that but with the amount of money american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2024 were planning on spending i think thats a pretty fair assumption and we report that but what we really focus on is making sure that were getting bill business acquired when you look at the composition obviously in a stronger environment youre really looking for more organic growth from your existing cardholders and i just made the comment before where as small businesses thats not what were seeing and so when you look at any growth that youre seeing from small business perspective that is truly from new cardholders acquired and a lot of the growth from a consumer perspective right now is new cardholders acquired which actually as we think about engaging with our cardholders gives me a lot of confidence going forward because as we continue to engage and not only get more wallet share but as our card members get back to where they were probably before the third and fourth quarter we believe there is upside there from a billings perspective and weve talked a lot about millennials over time and we get on this growth trend we get on this trajectory with these millennials and gen zers where we start with a higher share of wallet and we start with that higher share of wallet because theyre used to using their american express card everywhere and as they move through their life cycles their wallets increase and so we have a lot of confidence in the longterm lifetime value of the millennial base and of the gen z base that were now acquiring and you see even in this fourth quarter that is now of our total spending so when you think about this right now is a lot of the growth is coming that youre seeing is coming from new card acquisition but there will be an organic stepup as the economy gets better so and that gives us a lot of confidence of how were positioned for future growth over the long term which gives us confidence to say aspirationally we should be a plus revenue company and thats why you see the guidance that weve given this year and both from a revenue perspective and eps perspective kartik ramachandran senior vice president head of investor relations american express
