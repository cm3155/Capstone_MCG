business momentum wellpositioned to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and generate value for our stakeholders with that ill turn it over to jason to review our financial performance for the quarter jason jason j tyler executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported second quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was our reported results included an million net pretax gain related to visa and million of restructuring charges and other notable items which ill discuss in more detail shortly our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up modestly on a sequential basis and up sharply on a yearoveryear basis strong equity markets drove the yearoveryear improvement excluding notable items in all periods revenue was up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially expenses were up over the prior year and essentially flat sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees totaled billion a sequential increase and a increase compared to last year excluding notables in both periods all other noninterest income on an fte basis was down sequentially and up over the prior year we experienced good momentum in our fx trading business where we saw another strong quarter of client volume net interest income on an fte basis was million down sequentially and up from a year ago our credit quality remains very strong with no net chargeoffs and nonperforming loans representing basis points of total loans turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend with asset servicing fees totaling million custody and fund administration fees were million up yearoveryear driven by both strong underlying equity markets and new business activities assets under management for asset servicing clients were trillion investment management fees within asset servicing were million up yearoveryear due to favorable markets and strong flows into our institutional liquidity funds moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarterend trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were million up yearoveryear due primarily to strong equity markets and asset inflows within global family office northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 turning to page and our balance sheet and net interest income trends average deposits were billion up billion or from the first quarter modestly better than our expectations deposit costs increased slightly due to a handful of large thinly priced deposits shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet our average earning assets increased on a linkedquarter basis primarily due to higher deposit levels and the proceeds from the partial sale of our visa shares our average liquidity levels remain very strong with highly liquid assets equal to of our deposits and more than of total earning assets on average the duration of our securities portfolio is years and the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than one year net interest income was million and our net interest margin was turning to page as reported noninterest expense was billion in the second quarter up sequentially and up as compared to the prior year excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide expenses in the second quarter were flat sequentially now lets take a step back and discuss how were approaching the visa stake this is an asset we held on the balance sheet at zero value since visa went public over years ago entering the quarter the position was approximately billion in value on a pretax basis with the ability in the second quarter to liquidate half of our position at full value the visa transaction provides an opportunity to return more capital to shareholders while accelerating certain strategic priorities with this first conversion of shares were taking the following steps as mike highlighted first a meaningful portion of the proceeds will be used to increase pacing in our share repurchases we began that process within the second quarter and will continue at elevated levels over the next several quarters second approximately of the aftertax proceeds being contributed to our foundation this prefunds some of our community giving that contribution is fully accounted for in the second quarter third the visa share conversion enables us to accelerate strategic investments over the next several quarters to modernize our technology infrastructure and enhance our resiliencies this includes investments in refreshing our tech infrastructure automating manual processes enhancing risk management systems reducing endoflife platforms strengthening our cyber defenses and accelerating cloud migration these investments will further strengthen service levels and enhance the client experience while reducing risk and generating efficiencies this incremental modernization and resiliency spend is visible this quarter in the outside services line well continue to update you on our progress separately we also announced nearly million in restructuring charges and notable expenses the larger items included severance expense of million associated with a significant reduction in force split between both compensation and outside services expense various software writedowns and accelerations and the million contribution to our foundation i mentioned earlier now lets go back and review our core expenses from the quarter which exclude all notable items compensation expense was up a little less than versus the prior year moderately better than we anticipated as some anticipated hiring was shifted into thirdparty consulting work in conjunction with the incremental modernization and resiliency spend visible within the outside services line fulltime equivalent head count was down or over the prior year and essentially flat sequentially outside services expense increased by relative to the prior period the bulk of which reflects the incremental modernization and resiliency spend equipment and software expense increased by sequentially slightly northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 better than anticipated reflecting higher software consumption and amortization from projects coming online excluding notables our expense to trust fee ratio improved basis points on a sequential quarter basis to as we look out to the third quarter we expect our sequential expense growth adjusted for notable items to be up approximately equipment and software expenses are expected to range between million to million largely reflecting investments in technology and systems upgrades associated with the modernization and resiliency initiatives we do not expect a material increase in outside services in the third quarter from the current elevated level turning to page our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter and we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums based on the ccar results our stress capital buffer will remain at the minimum requirement our common equity tier ratio under the standardized approach increased basis points to a decrease in rwa levels the visa transaction and capital accretion drove the improvement this reflects a 560basispoint buffer above our regulatory requirements our tier leverage ratio was up basis points from the prior quarter at quarterend our unrealized pretax loss on availableforsale securities was million we generated million sic million in the quarter from the sale of visa shares and expect to generate another million in proceeds in early august we returned million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of million and common stock repurchases of million with that jessica please open the line for questions question and answer section operator certainly thank you operator instructions our first question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning betsy how are you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc excellent thanks so much okay yeah sure twopart question first is just on the remaining embedded gains in the visa that you still have i know you mentioned that there is still some realization to come are you talking about the onethird piece thats coming in the third quarter is that what youre referencing or are you referencing the broader point that you still have more visa shares and the next time this is able to get done youll have access there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its both so if you just youre close to it but for people that may not be this first tranche they first enable us to monetize half but enable us to convert half but thats split into actually selling it in three pieces as youre referencing two of those pieces are done one is still yet to come in august when thats done well still have half of the entire pool left at some point in the future to convert and monetize betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and thats a function of the visa side and the b shares being opened up to monetize thats there its not only your decision to do that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah correct not at all and as soon as and weve said all along visa is not a strategic asset for us and so we havent wanted to monetize more at a meaningful discount in the private markets and so weve waited to be able to do it in the public markets this enabled us to do it with no discount and well likely pursue a similar path when the remaining shares are opened up for conversion betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay perfect and then just a separate part is on the resiliency investments that youre making whats your sense of the timeframe for the investments i would think its a multiyear timeframe but be helpful to understand your point of view on that thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so i think about it in two pieces one is that theres elevated spending right now as we get the project accelerated thats why its showing up more in outside services and as we get some of the technology spend there and some thirdparty outside help on getting some things executed that should last in that line item at about this current level for the next few quarters eventually thats going to decline as some of that initial project work is done but at the same time well over time see an increase in compensation as some of the work continues in more of a persistent environment by actual fte but not likely at the same elevated level of where we are today betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats the overall view of how it should work northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc super okay thank you so much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning ken mokshith reddy q analyst jefferies llc hey its mokshith on for ken just wanted to ask about just nii cadence for the rest of the year what are you assuming on deposit levels deposit rates and where we can see that going forward just wanted some color on that thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure yeah so balances are much more stable than they were last year obviously and our client engagements worked well at this point the bigger factor definitely appears to be rates so theres no estimate for us to share for third quarter but in that period we do tend to see a slight seasonal decline in balances and so theres a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind one the seasonal decline in balances but then that could be offset by the fact that we still have positive impact of reinvestment spread day count improvement and then some other factors mokshith reddy q analyst jefferies llc okay fantastic just more on just servicing what are you seeing out there in terms of pipelines and anything on wealth management whether how the flows are there for client assets jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure ill start and mike may jump in so on asset servicing we mike and i both referenced it briefly the overall activity in the business from a net new business perspective is i think very positive the impact in this quarter comes from the fact that weve got one client exit that weve known about for a long time the big exits we have with we can we have longer line of sight on and that finally took place within the quarter which reduced our trust fees by a few million dollars in the quarter i should also note we also have line of sight to another similar dollar amount impact in next in third quarter thatll come in but overall the volume of activity is good and pipeline is strong within the business mike northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah the only thing i would add is as i mentioned weve really focused our strategy on the opportunities that we think are most attractive for our value proposition so those opportunities where we can be compensated for what we believe to be is a higher service level for the clients that has meant being more disciplined around pricing as i mentioned in certain cases it means not bidding on it if we believe its going to be something thats low cost driven and so far that hasnt really i would say reduced the overall momentum in the business and what were seeing in the opportunities and frankly its resulting in higher margins for the business that we are winning so its a more selective approach to it but one so far i would say is going well jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and then ill offer two headlines on wealth and then if mike may add more one is the regions the net new businesses was relatively soft but gfo in general continues to do well bringing on new business from existing clients and then also some nice external names their the connectivity they have with the largest asset owners is outstanding and that so that business continue to do well and a lot of initiatives inside the more wealth advisory space the regions the second dynamic ill mention within the business a different view is what are clients utilizing us for the advisory fee the advisory component of what our clients are doing with us is doing well its positive both in the regions and in gfo what but thats being offset by lower product utilization that tends to ebb and flow and we look more closely at the advisory component its more of an indication of the base of business and thats trending positively in both businesses mokshith reddy q analyst jefferies llc thanks for the color guys appreciate it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator operator instructions we will move next to brennan hawken with ubs your line is open please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning hey how are you good morning jason curious to know and i couldnt find a specific disclosure on this so apologies if you have disclosed it separately but could you tell me what percentage of your wealth management client assets are in advisory accounts and if you know what are the deposit costs for those accounts northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i got most of that just i just want to clarify the last sentence how much of it is what brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc what the deposit costs on those accounts would be jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp got it im glad i asked because i did not hear that well so on the first component we actually have not historically disclosed the breakdown of our fees that come from product versus from advisory but almost just at a high level virtually all of our wealth just particularly in the regions virtually all of those relationships have an advisory fee associated with them and the vast majority have product fees associated with them brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and then in terms of deposit costs we havent talked about deposit costs for that group specifically but i think where youre going with it is accurate the deposit costs in that client base are significantly lower than on the institutional side in general now the gfo business family office has some clients that are equal in size to some of our largest asset servicing clients but the bulk of that book is priced much more with lower deposit costs relative to the institutional side brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay so i dont know if you had or were aware of this or saw this but in the last week at this point three of the wirehouses have come out and said that they are bringing up the deposit costs on advisory relationships up to equivalent to money fund levels wells and bofa did that in the second quarter during the second quarter morgan stanley just yesterday announced that they intend to do it in the third given that this is the direction some of the largest providers in the industry are going this direction what are your thoughts and plans around making sure or aligning with this practice and if you dont plan to how do you intend to manage any legal or lawsuit risk on fiduciary issues michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah brennan its mike within the business its true of all of our businesses but just to be clear within wealth management as well its a competitive marketplace for all of the products that we offer and so to your point if other competitors or service providers in the space change their pricing on anything frankly but to your point on deposit levels then we absolutely have to react to that so thats the first point its dynamic northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 the second i would say is that its also based on the holistic relationship that we have and the entirety of what were offering for the client and as a result the different needs that they may have point being ill say not every deposit is created equally almost as simple as just start with a checking account is different than a savings account and the terms and the nature and characteristics are different and so the actual deposit costs if you will is going to be different based on that as well but needless to say if others are doing things in the market we have to be able to respond in kind brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure fair enough jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and one other dynamic is our sweep clients within the wealth business they already have the option to sweep on to our money market platform brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc oh thats a feature within the system where the advisor team or whatever could just adjust the sweep default and go into the money fund rather than deposits michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah and to be clear the client has the option to select what they would like to do jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc right well in an advisory relationship theres a little bit of a different dynamic but i got it okay just given the focus on this it might be helpful to consider disclosing some of these details going forward just to i know you said you didnt have them today but might be helpful going forward appreciate that michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp okay operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning mike northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jason you mentioned the million restructuring charge part of that is severance what were the underlying drivers for that charge what might cause you to do that again and what sort of future expense saves do you expect from that including for opex jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so drivers it really comes down to productivity mike and youve heard us talk about it a lot and weve got to continually look at the activities across the business and determine do we have the right skills do we have the right people are we in the right geographies and importantly also weve got to look at the span of control and the amount of layers we have in the organization and all of those different analyses led us to the conclusion that we could we should take some actions here and so well though obviously even with an example like spans and layers you might do eliminations but then you might also replace with eventually with a different skill set or a different span from a leadership perspective and so we wont get savings of these salaries but we should get at least and in general wed anticipate about half of the severance to impact our a decline in the ongoing salary run rate now obviously were growing in other areas of the company were growing head count in wealth management to grow that business were obviously investing in resiliency but for these areas that are affected here we should see that type of impact in the salary line mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so a permanent reduction in salaries equal to about half the severance with some of that reinvested back in the firm where youre hiring elsewhere is that correct jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no let me clarify so it would be the total amount of impacted salary would be close to the amount of the severance line but we would reinvest about half of it and so we should get an improvement from these areas in the neighborhood of million run rate on the salary line mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then just more generally maybe mike you talked about productivity and the custody business and you remain it seems like youre committed in the custody business but not just for growth but for more profitable growth and you say youre bidding less youre being more selective youre picking your spots so how would you describe northerns positioning in the custody business today versus the past michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so a couple of points to it mike one is within broadly speaking asset servicing at a high level you have the services that we provide to asset owners and then the services we provide to asset managers now theres a lot of hybrids within that as well and crossover of services but largely speaking those are the kind of northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 two big groups of clients and within the asset owner part of the space the nature of what were doing there is more scalable in the sense of to your point custody where adding on a new client requires less in the way of a head count addition and technology spend if you will to customize for what theyre doing now youve also heard us though talk about certain things like front office solutions thats a case where with an asset owner client that were looking to provide a higher differentiated level of capability for them and then correspondingly have the associated fee that goes with providing that so thats how i would say in the positioning there were trying to differentiate what were doing combination of capabilities like front office solutions and with a higher level of service that is consistent i would say with our brand with our culture and the way that we approach the clients across the company and then i would say on the asset manager side the asset manager services that we provide to them that has been a stronger source of growth for us over the last many years but it is more resourceintensive so when you look at the head count growth that weve had over time a lot of that is because its supporting bringing on new business there that does require additional partners meaning employees for us to provide that and thats an area id say were trying to be much more selective about those relationships and the opportunities that we pursue there so you heard me also talk about connectivity points and the point on that mike is that with an asset manager client for example if were only going to do one thing for them its probably not going to be attractive for us whereas if we can do a number of different things across the spectrum thats where that type of client relationship provides the level of profitability that were looking for so thats where id say that the focus is when you look at the business overall but then within the segments mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator go next to brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning maybe just one on net interest revenue maybe jason just your view on deposit betas across your franchise on the downside when the fed cuts and if you could just differentiate between wealth and asset servicing and i did see the interestbearing deposit line on the average balance sheet i think its a smaller category but that seemed to go down a lot i just was wondering what was driving that ph mix bps from bps sequentially northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i want to make sure i get the last what were you referencing on the last one brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc oh its just on the average balance sheet i think just the interestbearing deposit with banks on the asset side well it seemed to go down a lot i dont know if its just noise or on the rate on that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp might be that might be the fixed repo brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so its due yeah the due from banks and we can come back to you i think thats just noise in the reporting on a small denominator but in general on the betas i mean you saw the ecb reduction we got effectively beta on that and so at this point with rates at these levels the betas are going to be very high and so in that example both the standard rate card and the negotiated rates both came down in conjunction with the central bank change and even the negotiated rates tend to be on a spread to central bank rates and so we feel like again in this zone of where rates are the spread shouldnt change materially brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and just differentiating between wealth and the asset servicing business in terms of those deposit betas jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its similar the institutional business sometimes youll have again very large deposits and so that wont change thatll have more of what we should think of as a mix impact more than an impact coming from the rate changes from central banks so we gave an example even earlier in the very small number of very large deposits that can come on at tight spreads to central banks and so that will tighten spreads but that doesnt thats not correlated to the actual central bank movements which is really more the spirit of your question from what im understanding brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so on the wealth just to hammer down on this on the wealth side youve across your wealth franchise do you indiscernible northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah the wealth side is even a higher percentage of deposits on standard rates which again with rates at this elevated level well be able to move in conjunction with central bank movements brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just on expenses technical difficulty about the full year are you still targeting a technical difficulty i guess you have to have a downtick in oh sorry can you hear me jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no no no you brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hello jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp broke up real bad we brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc oh sorry can you hear me can you hear me now jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats better brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks i have my handset expenses for the full year so i know the up in are you still targeting the or better expense growth for the full year and which would imply i guess a downtick in and are you still also targeting positive fee operating leverage and maybe might that even be possible if net interest revenue continues to hold up might it be possible to generate operating leverage on total revenue for jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so on the expense just expense yearover we is going to be really hard i mean were in the first half of the year and we and its largely because of two factors one the markets elevated really quickly at the beginning of the year and that drove just in the first quarter alone it drove million to million in lift which is over basis points yearoveryear and then in conjunction with us deciding to accelerate the resiliency work that adds in another layer northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 and so its going to be hard this year and unlikely this year but it does not our still our longterm target is or less and theres no reason for us to change that longterm target just two dynamics this year one is frankly a good one because we get positive operating leverage out of the markets being higher and another one is us positioning ourselves for lower expense growth rate in the future as a result of what were doing on resiliency on the operating leverage side we on from a fee operating leverage side we should get fee operating leverage in the second half of the year and where the fee rates are higher revenue is higher and so that puts us in a good position from a total operating leverage perspective a little harder in third quarter just based on where markets are at this point hard to tell but fourth quarter from what we can see at this point would be much more likely to have total operating leverage there brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great colors thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet operator well move next to alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi hey jason mike good morning everybody so i wanted to followup on the questions brennan was asking earlier just as far as the wealth dynamics go and just i guess a couple of questions around that i guess one it sounds like youre evaluating still what the competitors have done so is it just kind of a matter of time before you guys decide to kind of go through the same process or i guess if you choose not to and outside of competitive pressures are there any other ramifications that might kind of force you and the industry to go down the same path so like in other words are you hearing anything from the regulators are you hearing anything from potential risk of litigation that could sort of ultimately force the industry to go in this direction so thats the first question jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and youre talking specifically on deposits alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah so the wealth deposits with advisory relationship jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 right alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc where the firm has a fiduciary duty jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah i just wanted to be clear to clarify so in that space in the we already have our rates are already at market and the clients and the advisors work together to determine what they want to select from a sweep perspective and so they can elect to sweep into money market mutual funds or on to our balance sheet but the dynamics that weve read about it doesnt its not reflective of our client base and of our platform alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc sorry but i guess if the industry goes to and youre saying youre at market but the market is at on deposits does that mean you guys would have to go to the market rate at jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no were closer to now alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay and then in terms of just the sizing i think in the past you talked about i think about a quarter of the deposit base was wealth the other was institutional so the quarter that is wealth can you delineate like kind of what the us deposit base is jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp what the realized deposit base well the quarter is the is roughly right its a little bit less than that but thats ballpark and what else are you trying to get alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc just like whats the us piece of that is is there a way to delineate that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp oh the us piece yeah thats virtually all of it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay great northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp again in the family the family office business might have some thats inter thats nonus but the vast majority of deposits on the wealth side are usdenominated alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you understood thank you and then just my followup question is around expenses so you guys are implementing incremental savings initiatives so it kind of makes sense and thats causing maybe incremental technology spend this year as you sort of think about long term and weve talked about expenses to fee ratio for many years now but given that its still proven to be pretty sticky at this kind of 100andsortof15ish percent range whats the goalpost as you kind of put this all through it maybe it takes a year two years three years but what are you driving towards and how long do you think itll take you to get there jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah mike do you want that michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp the goalposts havent changed alex i mean that when i say the timing not even saying like how far out it is per se but just as you know the components of that calculation are going to move at different rates for different reasons meaning markets and organic growth on the fee side and then likewise youre going to have time periods where the expense growth can be a little bit higher a little bit lower on that part of the equation and so the goalpost is still getting that to that to we think thats our target operating range for that ratio and as youre seeing weve we brought that down would we like it to go faster yes but again its balancing off the things that we need to do in order to drive organic growth so that you get it the benefit of that on the ratio and then as jasons saying you make certain investments that you absolutely are looking to get greater efficiencies as a result of those going forward so we have a lot of manual processes for example that were automating across not only the operations of our business but also across other parts of the business that have to do with our risk and control so a lot of opportunities there to yes improve the resiliency as weve mentioned a number of times but also get efficiency out of it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it great thank you guys very much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator well go next to vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks a couple of questions just want to understand mike and jason the severance charge that youre taking its a much larger severance charge than weve seen you take in many years i guess the visa gain gives you that opportunity when do you expect to start to show have that show up in the compensation line and over what period jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so we mentioned that a lot of the many of the actions have already been taken and at the same time the program that we instituted this time is more over months and so itll bleed in over itll get embedded over that timeframe vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc but youve taken the charge right up front okay okay jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right and when you so when you talk about the under ph right mike you said jason that its unlikely this year should this make it much more likely next year where do you given especially the severance benefit that bleeds in over the next months jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp it puts us in a it does put us in a better position next year and the spirit of what were doing particularly with the resiliency spend is to accelerate some of the spend that weve had on our road map over the next several years so that helps and also the actions were taking around productivity help a lot as well and so it definitely puts us in a better position but were its early july and its still early to talk about what next year looks like but from what we see right now theres the things that are predictable at this point theres no theres nothing that tells us we shouldnt have that or better outlook for next year and we feel like were well positioned for it at this point given some of the things that weve talked about vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and again related to the visa pardon me if i missed anything because i just theres a lot of earnings going on this morning but buybacks you did some over what period should we see the rest given that youve used about couple million now i know thats all pretax but how much more should we expect to see and how soon northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so the visa situation is very helpful and it puts several hundred million dollars maybe call it half of the aftertax proceeds in our minds available for buyback particularly if you look at where our capital ratios are capital levels are right now theres no race for us to do that and so we can do it over time we can do it deliberately we also have to keep an eye on whats happening from a regulatory environment and what basel requirements might be from a capital perspective but were obviously positioned very well to continue to have elevated levels of buyback vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks operator well go next to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is open please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you and im sorry jason if im being repetitive i just wanted to make sure we heard you correctly the stock was down about at one point still down a lot i just wanted to make sure that your messaging on nii is essentially saying you expect third quarter nii to be relatively flat given the decline in balances should be offset by the investment yields am i hearing that correctly and youre not really seeing any impact from these sweep deposits that have impacted some of the other banks given where youve already priced deposits for your customers jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp correct we see third quarter nii at this point flat ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and from thereon rate cuts if we get them in september should be a positive for the nii or negative jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp unlikely to less likely to be positive but we dont see as long as rates are at these levels and just take us just take the fed being in the at this high level of rates on an absolute basis getting 25basispoint 50basis point reductions at this point should not have material spread degradation ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 thats helpful and clearer and on the fee revenue side apologies if we missed this i think you mentioned you lost a client thats going to have a fewmilliondollar impact im just trying to get a sense of what your expectations are for fee revenue all else equal as you think about the third quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no nothing to provide in terms of an estimate and i mean if you think about it if its a few million dollars this quarter a few million dollars next quarter cumulatively thats a reduction of million round number even within asset servicing on a quarterly trust fee base of over million and so were just trying to once we start talking about growth in the business and about overall net new business activity that number has more of an impact but it doesnt have as much of an impact on the overall amount of fees in the business and so thats why we called it out its just in the context of thinking about new business activity and organic growth where it has more of an impact on a percentage basis but in general the business is doing well and the activity levels the pipeline and what we see on the horizon is still good just important to call out those two items ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i can sneak in one quick followup on expenses the actions you took this quarter youre not guiding for this my takeaway is it probably sets up for an even better or lower expense growth for is that the right way to interpret that relative to whatever you do in jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah it is theres no doubt that some of the expenses that we put on now again its an acceleration of what weve planned and some of it we do believe will come down next year i talked about the offset as we do some hiring in some of these spaces but we also came into this year feeling very good about the but the markets moved early and so it does give an indication that when markets move and it can impact the expenses again we have positive operating leverage in that but at this point of midjuly im hesitant to talk in too much detail about well certainly give an update later in the year but the spirit of your question is right in that some of the spending now positions us for even better expense trajectory management going into next year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc extremely helpful thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator well return to brennan hawken with ubs your line is open please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking my followup i just wanted to draw a specific understanding because it was a little unclear with alexs followup to the question on the wealth deposits did you say that the advisory wealth deposits are northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 currently priced at or they have the option to elect for money funds that could yield im just trying to square all the commentary jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so its the latter they have the ability to sweep into our money fund complex which already is priced in the and so our clients have the ability to elect for that deposit mechanism now to the extent that they are sweeping brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it so just to further add a little color to my question the option to move into money funds was available at most of the wirehouses too and they made this move but its my understanding due to concerns about the fiduciary obligation and whether or not just basically paying out that level would be just necessary from a legal perspective so it sounds like from your answer you guys dont have any plans to make any change at this stage although as you said depending on competitive pressures you may seek to make adjustments going forward jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i think thats a good summary brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thanks very much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet operator and well return to vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks just wanted to clarify jason a comment you made which was rate cuts to basis points should not have material spread degradations so does that mean if we do have rate cuts those would be hurt that would hurt your nim and nii as you are assetsensitive jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no im saying that as we have rate cuts at this point we that we should be able to pass along those declines in the form of lower deposit yields to clients in our standard rate cards and in our negotiated rates vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 okay what did you see with the ecb 25basispoint rate cut that has come through have you cut those deposit rates by basis points jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah yeah and i did comment on that really specifically earlier we did see aligned reductions in deposit costs on the ecb change vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay that means you passed on the full basis points jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry
