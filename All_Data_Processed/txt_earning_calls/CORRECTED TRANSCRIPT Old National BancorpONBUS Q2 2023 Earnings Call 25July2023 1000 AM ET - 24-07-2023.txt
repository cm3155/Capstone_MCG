and respectively our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low tangible book value excluding aoci also increased yearoveryear deposit balances were up during the quarter with growth in core deposits of as we continue to compete for new banking relationships effectively our total cost of deposits was basis points and we maintained our deposit pricing discipline with a low total deposit beta cycle to date our credit quality remained stable with basis points of nonpcd related charge offs we remain watchful and consistent with other banks that are focused on potential pockets of softness like our deposit portfolio our loan portfolio is granular and relationshipdriven which should continue to serve us well we remain confident in our client selection and underwriting and as you know old national has taken a proactive approach to managing credit this approach has served us well in the past and you see evidence of that ph stance this quarters work to address any credit deterioration aggressively on the client side engagement remained high in the quarter we expect full relationships with our borrowing clients and to the extent that new or existing clients lack that potential we will manage accordingly we do however continue to expect disciplined loan portfolio growth in in other areas its more of the same our below peer deposit cost should drive a funding advantage we expect to see organic growth of our wealth management client base and we continue to focus on disciplined expense management while building tangible book value we also continue to invest in top revenue generating talent and expand into dynamic new markets within our footprint we recently celebrated the opening of our first metro detroit area commercial banking office with a terrific new team and we announced two prominent commercial relationship managers have joined our nashville wealth management team before i turn things over to brendon i also want to take a moment to share that our old national family continues to recover and heal from the louisville tragedy on april that claimed the lives of five of our team members and impacted so many others more than three months later our onb family continues to do our best to love care for and support one another additionally in june our downtown louisville team began serving clients at a new location in the heart of downtown louisville once again i want to thank countless individuals and organizations who have cared for and supported our family during this challenging time i also want to acknowledge and thank our team members for their resiliency and their commitment to supporting one another with that i will now turn the call over to brendon to cover the quarterly results in more detail brendon b falconer chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp thanks jim turning to our quarterend balance sheet on slide we continue to effectively navigate the challenging operating environment achieving a more efficient balance sheet we improved our earning asset mix with cash flows from our investment portfolio reinvested in loans while ph their funding mix improved through higher deposit balances and lower borrowings as a result our loantodeposit ratio improved by basis points while strong earnings bolstered our capital levels and contributed to tangible book value growth despite facing aoci headwinds old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 on slide we present the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields total loans grew by in line with our expectations we sold approximately million of nonrelationship ci loans at par during the quarter as we look to manage liquidity while prioritizing lending to our clients with full banking relationships the investment portfolio decreased by mainly due to portfolio cash flows and declines in fair values despite rate shifts the duration remained steady at years and is not expected to extend further cash flows from the portfolio are expected to be billion over the next months moving to slide we show our trend in total deposits which increased billion or quarteroverquarter core deposits grew approximately million including million of normal seasonal public inflows the trend in average deposits reflects the continued mix shift away from noninterestbearing accounts into money markets and ph cds market conditions continue to put upward pressure on deposit rates with interestbearing deposit costs increasing basis points to resulting in a cycle todate interestbearing deposit beta of total deposit costs were relatively low at which equates to a cycle todate total deposit beta of while its challenging to estimate the terminal beta we had a strong track record of managing deposit rates and are confident we can maintain our funding cost advantage throughout the remainder of the rate cycle our disciplined approach to exception pricing has allowed us to successfully defend deposit balances and our targeted promotions have resulted in above peer deposit growth slide provides our quarterend income statement we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings include million in pretax merger related and other charges excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was our profitability continues to be strong with an adjusted return on average tangible common equity of and adjusted return on average assets of moving on to slide we present details of our net interest income and margin both metrics surpassed our expectations as we reported a linkedquarter increase in net interest income and experienced lower than anticipated margin compression our strong performance was bolstered by the quarter point rate hike by the fed in may and our better than expected deposit growth furthermore we continue to make progress towards achieving our targeted neutral rate risk position by the end of the rate cycle while prudently adding protection against any sudden reversal in fed rate policy slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter our primary fee businesses remained stable but we did benefit from a million increase in other income that we would not anticipate in a run rate next quarter the items driving that increase were companyowned life insurance revenues a recovery from a prior chargedoff asset and positive derivative valuations associated with the transition from libor to sofr continuing to slide we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusted expenses were million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low our expenses were well controlled and consistent with the previous quarter excluding a million increase in incentive accruals related to our strong yeartodate performance this would equate to a q3 run rate of million on slide we present our credit trends which remained stable reflecting the strong performance of both our commercial and consumer portfolios delinquencies have decreased and net chargeoffs have remained steady at a modest basis points excluding the basis point impact from pcd loans the rise in nonperforming loans old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 primarily stems from the anticipated migration of pcd credits as we maintain an aggressive approach to resolving these loans while chargeoffs from this portfolio are expected to remain elevated in the short term we expect minimal impact on provision expense given that we currently carry a million or approximately reserve against this book our second quarter allowance including reserve for unfunded commitments stands at million or basis points of total loans the modest reserve increase was largely driven by loan growth partially offset by adjustments in our economic forecast we continue to rely on a weighted moodys s3 scenario that projects peak unemployment of and negative gdp growth of barring any significant deterioration beyond these economic assumptions we expect provision expense to remain limited to portfolio performance and loan growth shifting to key areas of focus on slide you will see further details on our loan portfolio our commercial loan book which constitutes approximately of our total loans is granular and well diversified our nonowner occupied cre is also well diversified across various asset classes and geographies regarding nonowner occupied office properties the majority of the portfolio was comprised of suburban or medical offices with a significant portion of credit tenant leases only a negligible percentage less than of total loans is attributed to properties located within central business districts that are geographically dispersed across midwestern cities in our footprint on slide we provide highlights from our recent examination of fixed rate cre maturities over the next months less than of total loans that are nonowner occupied cre mature within months and carry a note rate of less than our approach to underwriting cre includes a 300basispoint margin over the current rates at the time of origination while these maturing credits have surpassed the original underwriting ph stressed coupon we have observed improved net operating income from higher rents this improvement has been sufficient to uphold debt service ratios in line with our underwriting guidelines and we believe the refinance risk in this portfolio to be minimal slide details our q2 commercial production the billion of production was well balanced across all product lines and major markets as discussed on last quarters call we have tightened our pricing standards enhanced our credit structure and reinforced with our ph rms the importance of acquiring a full banking relationship for new loan requests as a result of these actions and strong q2 production our pipeline has decreased to billion and is consistent with low to midsingle digit loan growth we expect in the back half of the year on slide we present further insights into our deposit base our average core deposit balance is meaningfully lower than peers of our accounts have less than on deposit and carry an average balance of just its important to highlight that we maintain strong enduring relationships with our deposit customers of which have been with the bank for over years our top deposit clients represent only of total deposits and have a weighted average tenure of greater than years lastly our brokered deposits were of total deposits at the end of the quarter which we expect to be well below peer average on slide we provide a comprehensive overview of our capital position at the end of the quarter we observed improvements in all regulatory capital ratios and maintained stability in our tce ratio despite facing the negative impact of increasing aoci our above peer return on tangible common equity coupled with our peer average dividend payout ratio should result in us accreting capital at a faster rate than most additionally we anticipate old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 of our outstanding aoci to accrete to capital by the end of we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and do not intend to do so in the near term as we focus on capital growth in summary our strong second quarter performance marked the successful conclusion of the first half of with results slightly exceeding our expectations we have improved the efficiency ratio of our balance sheet through a better earning asset mix strong core deposit growth led to a better funding mix and we grew tangible book value per share by excluding ph the oci impact despite the challenging rate environment our net interest income grew quarteroverquarter largely due to the strong execution of our deposit strategy we have demonstrated an ability to both expand our customer base while maintaining peerleading deposit costs our credit portfolio remained stable and our disciplined approach to managing expenses is evident in our quarterly adjusted efficiency ratio of slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we believe our current pipeline should support second half loan growth in the low to midsingle digit range with full year growth in the mid to high single digit range we continue to target at or above industry deposit growth and we are reconfirming our guide on to yearoveryear net interest income increase with a stronger conviction towards the higher end of this range the key assumptions in this guidance include one more rate hike and a throughthecycle interestbearing deposit beta of to by yearend and noninterestbearing deposits falling to we expect fee businesses to be stable in the back half of with the exception of the million in nonrun rate items we noted earlier our expense outlook is adjusted to approximately million for full year excluding mergerrelated charges and property optimizationrelated expenses this reflects our prior guidance of million adjusted upward by million for higher incentive accruals million of this has already been accrued at quarterend provision expense should continue to be limited to loan growth portfolio changes and nonpcd chargeoffs as we believe we have adequate reserves against the pcd book turning to taxes we expect approximately million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis with those comments id like to open up the call for your questions we do have the full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well pause for just a moment to compile the qa roster okay well take our first question from ben gerlinger with hovde group please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hate to do a modeling question upfront but you guys gave a lot of guidance with both the left and right side of the balance sheet more specifically to the cost of liabilities and deposits going forward the one piece that i think was missing and i kind of just backed into it a little bit was the average earning asset yield or what you might see on an uptick in terms of the next rate hike so it putting it all together im coming up with a margin around a kind of at yearend i might be off by a couple of bps here and there but is that do you think thats a fair assumption and then how what would be some possible factors that could be above or below that brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yes i think youre in the ballpark ben i think what we need to think about is what is the velocity of deposit pricing going forward and how well can we do against that deposit beta guide we got i can tell you today the velocity does ph seem to have slowed i know were one month into the third quarter but i think theres some potential upside there and we do have a still a significant amount of fixed asset repricing fixed pricing assets that will reprice for the next months thats meaningful and could and should help defer a lot of this kind of latecycle deposit repricing that we have so i think those are the two items that can probably offset margin pressure going forward benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you and then just kind of following up on that is that just erring on the side of conservatism because you guys do have a really healthy deposit franchise that youre beta kind of that doesnt whipsaw nearly as much as some of the lowerquality peers i guess you could say so like is it more just elongation it just seems a little conservative to me but you guys probably have a better vantage point old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp i think our throughthecycle deposit beta that weve put out there i think that range i think seems reasonable time will tell but what we can we continue to say whatever ph deposit beta is due for the industry we think we outperform it at the end of the day thats our best guess today in this environment and will we try to outperform it absolutely one thing i were certainly confident in is we can be better than peers benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you thats great and then have one more kind of just changing topics a little bit you guys kind of historically modeled for the worst case scenario based on moodys s3 and with that as the backdrop if you guys are slowing loan growth does that kind of negate the economic factors associated with cecl or is it more bad could get worse in their modeling therefore you go lower what im really getting at here is if youre slowing loan growth should the provision come down as well assuming theres no credit events brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp the out provision should be generally limited to loan growth and nonpcd chargeoffs and so if loan growth moderates a little bit that should moderate provisioning expense going forward benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc all right ph its all good appreciate it great quarter hope the rest of year continues this trend james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks ben operator good next well go to scott siefers with piper sandler your lines open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys thank you for taking the question just wanted to ask a question on nii so obviously a really good performance im glad to see the sturdy guide brendon maybe if you could offer just sort of any thoughts you might have or be comfortable with on sort of when and why you would see nii ultimately bottoming and to the extent possible what would happen to it thereafter i mean presumably it becomes a function of loan growth and sort of back book repricing but maybe just sort of nuances of upcoming ebbs and flows and nii in the aggregate brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp scott yeah i think its impossible to predict with any level of kind of precision when nii bottoms out and at what level i can tell you that we continue to run ph an assetintensive balance sheets and the next rate hike will help offset any deposit headwinds as weve talked about a little earlier i think the pace of deposit old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 repricing has slowed a little bit so i dont want to call the end but certainly theres more probably downside pressure than upside opportunity at this point r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay and as it relates to the noninterestbearing deposits which i so i think we have them going down to or assuming they go down to from roughly today maybe just sort of the background as to what you guys are thinking that leads you to believe thats the right number in other words what are sort of the risks but also what youre seeing that that suggests they will settle out fairly soon brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yes were monitoring the pace of that transition out of noninterestbearing into higherinterestbearing account its probably maybe the most aggressive of the assumptions in there but probably has maybe the smallest impact in terms of our guides so i dont think it moves around our nii guidance significantly if we missed that by a couple of percentage points it but scott honestly its our best guess thats a tough one to call but were monitoring the behaviors and we feel comfortable with that level now and well update you if that changes r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you very much james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you and next well go to david long with raymond james your line is now open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc lets stick with the deposit discussion here and the question i have is it seems like june there was a lot of competition as banks wanted to show deposit growth in the quarter is your sense that maybe deposit competition has eased in july and then as a second part of that through throughout the second quarter and into here in july where are you seeing the biggest competition is it the gsibs is it the regionals is it the community banks where is it most competitive thanks old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah i dont think that david its mark i dont think that competition has eased i would say the pace of increases has eased is what brendon was trying to convey so we stay competitive were staying in the upper half of the market in terms of our rate positioning and i just think theres still fierce competition and where is it coming from frankly everywhere and so more of the midsized banks than anything else the sifis dont have to compete as much as a but all of our markets have plenty of competition and i think its still pretty healthy out there david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it cool okay and then secondly wanted to ask about your appetite to hire additional commercial bankers i know you guys have had a lot of success over the last year or two in that are you still looking to hire within your footprint and if so what does the commercial banker thats attractive to you look like mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp well the answer to your question is yes so well always stay in the market weve got a longterm view and weve said it a lot but well repeat it good revenue producers pay for themselves quickly even in this environment were building a model for the long term and people weve got a good story to tell and we want to take advantage of that when people are looking to make a move and frankly be proactive with people who might not be looking to make a move we have slowed the pace of hiring this year largely because we dont need to add folks we just are being opportunistic but we still hired nine revenue producers across wealth and commercial in q2 and well continue to look for it the prototypical profile is a seasoned a to or more of your banker whos relationship banking within our markets i guess is the best way to put it david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks mark appreciate it thanks everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks david operator next well go to chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hello good morning how are you guys doing indiscernible old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey brendon maybe another one for you if i think market consensus is that we stay higher for longer after this weeks fed move if that plays out to the earlier comments on margin should the narrative get a little bit harder next year or is it kind of a balancing act where you can kind of hold margins ph in nii brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp i think its a balancing act right its fed fight its fed fight to hold margin which we all play i can and i think we have an advantage over most others given our the quality of our deposit franchise with the velocity of deposit cost can slow like i said we have a lot of earning assets at fixed rates that are going to reprice meaningfully higher our fixed rate book is going to reprice at basis points above kind of runoff yields ph or investment portfolio that were reinvesting into loans is plus basis points so yeah i think we have the tools and the balance sheet to help fight for flat in a higher for longer rate environment christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then in terms of capital jim you talked to just about everythings kind of on hold given the environment what are you looking for to kind of maybe make a switch to returning more capital james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp theres an awful lot to play out here with respect to the economy and the last rate move i think like all investors right i mean they were trying to answer those questions and then i think we get more comfort in how do we think about returning capital and which form so i think i think we get more clarity as the year continues to progress and would have better opex heading into next year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and maybe if i could just sneak one more in brendon the i think you mentioned million of kind of non run rate fees so that would put you kind of ph kind of ballpark for quarterly fees i wanted to try and understood that and then given the tax benefit in the quarter i know you gave the full year guide but do you have what the back of the envelope is for the back half of the year with that adjustment brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yeah so i think that indiscernible is the right number for fees going forward given sort of mortgage and capital markets headwinds and then on the tax rate i think that full year guide just probably approximates the back two quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right perfect thanks old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks chris operator thank you next well go to terry mcevoy with stephens your line is now open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe the decline in the loan pipeline the billion to billion how much of that is internal focus on the full relationship and just tightening things up versus just less market demand out there mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah terry its mark its i wont put percentages out of it but more is driven by our internal our focus than it is external i mean certainly cre markets have retracted a bit and are not as active so theres some of that but more of it is frankly indiscernible balance sheet and as jim and brendon both alluded to our comments were a relationship bank and we always are that way but occasionally you in the past you got time where you leave with credit in this environment were not doing that deposits have to come as they want and if the pipeline didnt have reflect that we move them out of the pipeline so weve rationed our pipeline down proactively terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks guys and then just overall managing the size of the balance sheet whats your appetite for additional loan sales and will the cash flow from the securities portfolio be utilized to fund loan growth brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yeah terry this is brendon yeah we lastly use the investment portfolio to continue to fund loans and i think to the extent that deposits continue to grow to fund our loan growth well use that if it doesnt theres opportunities to continue to pare but it wont be significant or sizable terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and maybe just one last one i mean the expense guide i just want to make sure it fully captures what jim talked about in terms of the southeast michigan and the detroit build out what youre doing in wealth management what youre doing in nashville youve got a lot of growth initiatives but youve really been able to selffund it and old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 havent raised the expense guidance which i think has been a real positive surprise im just making sure all those initiatives you feel like are captured in that in the expense guide for this year brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yes terry absolutely its all captured in it james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thats the goal right i mean i think we have continued opportunities to invest in people and any technology needs but at the same time weve got to figure out ways to selffund that and so we want to be incredibly disciplined around what that looks like terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i totally agree thanks for taking my questions james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry operator thank you next well go to brody preston with ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey i just wanted to follow up brendon i think you said that there might be some i think upside on nii or maybe it was jim that said that just depending on what happens with the velocity of the deposit beta guide i think the spot rate in the deck excuse me you said was and so i guess how has the velocity changed from that level brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yeah it slowed materially but its early days in the quarter and so we dont want to declare victory and say thats a permanent change of velocity but we have seen some positive trends on that front and obviously well continue to watch it old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i saw the uptick in broker deposits quarteroverquarter and it looked like it was fairly spread out between the frontend and the backend but i wanted to ask just like just given nibs came in a bit better than what i expected are you guys planning on maybe slowing the pace of brokered or is there a potential for you to pay brokered deposits back and would that kind of feed into maybe a slowing of the increase in the deposit cost trajectory brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yeah its all about core deposit growth trajectory to the extent that we continue to grow core deposits at rates you know better than brokered well continue to do that and deemphasize our use of broker brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay and then the last one for me just in terms of the loan pipeline im sorry if i missed it do you have a sense for i guess what portion of it is kind of fixed rate versus floating rate at this point and what kind of new fixed rate origination yields are james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah yeah we do its about floating and fixed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and is there a difference between what the origination yields are on the fixed rate versus the floating rate brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yeah we actually put it in the slide deck so our floating rate just in june was and fixed was around just above that could move up a little bit given a potential obviously rate hike coming here shortly brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc what drives that delta brendon between commercial fixed and commercial floating being basis points to basis points kind of difference at this point in the rate cycle brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp yes its a swap curve you think about the average tenure of these fixed rate deals five years that fiveyear swap curve is about that below brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it okay great well thank you very much for taking my questions i appreciate it old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks brody operator next well go to jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of followups just on the margin brendon to just put it all together do you feel like is the margin inflecting now i mean if the fed has done this week is it inflecting sentimently in your mind brendon b falconer a chief financial officer senior executive vp old national bancorp i think that i think theres probably more downward pressure than upward opportunity in this but its still dependent on again the velocity of deposit repricing and where these terminal betas end up theres opportunities to continue to grow nii in the earning asset side because of fixed rate assets repricing is it enough to offset it we just dont know yet jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay slide this is great because its you dont have exposure to the central business districts so i think the banks that dont have the exposure tend to talk about it more openly but youre in a lot of big cities what are you seeing in terms of central business district office real estate is it do you feel like its as big as a problem as you make it out to be on the outside just curious what youre seeing mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp i think you just answered your own question i think its not as big of a problem as its made out to be and yet we all have our eye on it its not like its robust and there arent much in the way of new opportunities certainly but the risk there exists i think its perhaps a little overly stressed in the media i think we have are as well circled and to extent we need to ph well reserve for the couple of opportunities that where there are issues jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good and then jim one for you anything on regulatory concerns youre on the youre well under a billion but what anything that youre hearing that you think would have an ph over outsized impact on old national old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2023 james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i think obviously were paying really close attention to whats being said out there and we have always been in the position of having good regulatory relationships and this is now not the time to reduce any emphasis on the work you do right and so we just got to continue to improve it at every single thing we do to meet regulatory expectations exceed regulatory expectations but as i see those things i think that the toughest ones seem to be aimed at banks north of billion and obviously theres a lot of distance between where were at today and that number so i think were in a great spot i actually think were in the sweet spot for kind of profitability in terms of banks our size where we have the scale to go off and hire and invest in technology and yet well maybe miss some of the toughest things that come to our industry so i think were in a really strong spot to be for the next few years jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah i agree returns look really good so all right thank you appreciate it james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon operator there are no further questions at this time ill now turn the call back over to jim ryan for closing remarks james c ryan chief executive officer director old national bancorp well as always we appreciate your participation thanks for the one or two questions that i actually got and that more directed towards brendon and mark
