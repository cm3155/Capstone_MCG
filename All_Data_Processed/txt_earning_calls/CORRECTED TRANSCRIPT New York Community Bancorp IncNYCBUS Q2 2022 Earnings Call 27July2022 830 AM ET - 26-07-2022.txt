over to mr cangemi to begin todays conference call thomas robert cangemi chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you sal good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter performance first however id like to comment on our merger with flagstar both sides are fully committed to completing the transaction as soon as possible and we feel very good about where we stand currently over the past months both companies have diligently worked together to get us to a strong position to close the deal quickly once all regulatory approvals are received were excited about the benefits of the deal today as we were when it was first announced in addition to the both earnings per share and tangible value accretion a merger with flagstar significantly improves our overall funding profile and interest rate sensitivity indiscernible wholesale borrowings to being more significantly deposit funded and becoming asset sensitive as well in addition it provides for both geographic and product diversification and accelerates our plan to transform our business model to a more dynamic commercial bank model driving strong financial performance and capital generation as for our second quarter results we are extremely pleased with the companys strong operating performance during the second quarter by almost any measure results exceeded expectations despite higher interest rates and market volatility we recorded record net income another quarter of record deposit growth near record loan growth record originations and a higher net interest margin and stable operating expenses while asset quality remained stellar these trends resulted in a solid yearoveryear eps growth for the second quarter of we reported operating dilutive eps of a share up compared to a share for the second quarter of and well ahead of the analyst consensus turning now to the details of our quarterly performance one of the primary highlights of this quarters operating performance was our deposit growth for the second consecutive quarter deposits grew by approximately billion the growth continues to be driven by the bankingasaservice initiative and loan related deposits as i have discussed previously one of my top strategies if not the top is to increase the banks focus on deposit gathering and deemphasize our need for wholesale borrowings and other less traditional funding sources new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 longer term ph our success executing on our strategy will result in higher net interest margin the early results are quite positive since launching these initiatives early last year total deposits have increased to billion up billion or while core deposits increased to billion up billion or at the same time wholesale borrowings primarily federal home loan bank advances declined almost billion or to billion during the current quarter total deposits increased billion and billion through the first six months of the year our bankingasaservice business was the biggest contributor to this growth bankingasaservice deposits rose billion or on a linked quarter basis and billion year to date bankingasaservice deposits totaled billion at june which is significant progress considering we started this business from scratch in the first quarter of last year with virtually zero deposits our bankingasaservice related deposits fall largely into three categories traditional baas which primarily encompasses fintechrelated deposits totaling billion government banking as a service serving municipalities and eventually us treasurys prepaid debit card program totaling million and mortgage as a service catering to mortgage banking servicing companies and consisting of escrow accounts indiscernible billion we also are having great success in garnering deposits from our loan customers total loan related deposits rose just under million during the second quarter to billion up annualized on a linked quarter basis for the first six months of these deposits increased million far surpassing the million we generated for all of last year all told since were focusing on this deposit source in the first quarter of last year loan related deposits have grown billion up about moving now to lending we also had a very strong quarter in lending loan growth during the quarter was billion second only to the record billion of loan growth we generated in the fourth quarter of last year this quarters loan growth was driven by our multifamily portfolio where we continue to make market share gains as competition abates along with heightened refinancing activity as market interest rates move higher during the quarter forcing many borrowers to come to the table to refinance indiscernible sooner rather than later at june the multifamily portfolio was billion up billion or on an annualized basis compared to the previous quarter while the specialty finance portfolio totaled billion up million on a linked quarter basis or its important to note that we have approximately billion of multifamily and cre loans that come up on the contractual maturity date andor repricing between now and june with an average weighted coupon of indiscernible loans at an average weighted coupon of represents billion of this amount while cre loans at an average weighted coupon of represents the remaining billion the other driver was a significant growth in the specialty finance portfolio due primarily to high utilization rates at june the specialty finance segment had total commitments of billion of compared to billion at march of the june amount or billion of these commitments are structured as floating rate obligations which have and will continue to benefit us in a rising rate environment despite higher interest rates we have had a record quarter for originations and our current pipeline looks very good and were heading to the third quarter loan origination set a new record as we originated billion during the second quarter up at the end of the previous quarter and up compared to the second quarter of last year second quarter originations far exceeded the prior quarters pipeline by billion more than double last quarters billion pipeline of the current quarters originations were refinancing from our own portfolio were refinancing from other banks portfolio and were related to property transactions as for the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 pipeline the current pipeline heading into the third quarter of the year is a robust billion on par with last quarter of this amount billion or of the pipeline was new money for the bank moving now to asset quality our credit trends and asset quality remained stellar and continue to rank nycb as among the best in the industry nonperforming assets totaled million compared to million last quarter and were basis points of total assets compared to basis points last quarter earlystage delinquencies also declined and principalonly loan deferrals were at a very manageable level decreasing from the prior quarter to million in addition we had million of net recoveries this quarter compared to net chargeoffs of million from last quarter before moving on to the next topic id like to provide an update on the new york city real estate environment new york city residential real estate remains healthy and commercial real estate is improving gradually retail prices across the three borrowers of brooklyn queens and manhattan have reached new highs this has been due to low inventory and higher mortgage rates which have pushed homebuyers to becoming renters medium residential lands in manhattan are above for the second straight month with rents continuing to make new highs over the past five months in brooklyn the medium rent is marking a new high for the borrower for the second straight month while in queens especially in northwest queens which is closer to the indiscernible manhattan rents are also at record highs on the rent stabilized side the rent guidelines board approved rate hikes of for one year leases and for twoyear leases beginning in the fourth quarter these increases marked the largest increase in almost a decade and will go a long way to offset some of the increases in operating costs office leasing activity is showing signs of life of ph yearoveryear with demand for class a space up on a yearoveryear basis moving now to the income statement second quarter net interest income totaled million up million or on a yearoveryear basis excluding the impact from prepayment income net interest income on a non gaap basis increased million or to million on a yearoveryear basis our preprovision net revenue was also very strong second quarter ppnr increased million or to million on a yearover year basis excluding the impact from merger related expenses ppnr grew million or to million year over year moving next to the nim the nim improved during the second quarter despite the fed aggressively raising interest rates several times to combat inflation at the nim was up basis points sequentially excluding the impact from prepayment income the nim was up basis points on a linkedquarter basis and slightly better than expectations given that flagstar is significantly asset sensitive and we are liability sensitive we are very comfortable with the nim on a pro forma basis on a expense front our noninterest expenses remain in check despite the company is continuing to invest in various businesses and hiring more people noninterest expenses were million for the second quarter which includes million of mergerrelated expenses excluding this operating expenses totaled million unchanged from the previous quarter and up only modestly on a yearoveryear basis additionally our efficiency ratio came in at down compared to the both the prior year ago quarter and this level is well below the peer average of approximately as you can see we had a broadbased strength throughout the organization during the current quarter this is all made possible by the hard work dedication and patience indiscernible all our employees and indiscernible them for helping the company achieved the strong performance this quarter at yesterdays meeting the board of directors declared a new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 dividend on our common shares the dividend will be paid on august to common shareholders of record as of august based on yesterdays closing stock price this translates into an annualized dividend yield of with that we will be happy to answer any questions you may have we will do our very best to get to all of you within time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or during the week operator please open the lines for questions question and answer section operator certainly well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning tom so i guess a strong quarter from a loan growth indiscernible standpoint i think you mentioned comfort with pro forma net interest margins maybe if we can just start there give us a sense of where you see the margin going based on the rate hikes weve had the one well probably get this afternoon if we think about nycb standalone and beyond just how do we think about funding costs and deposit betas over the next few quarters given all the actions youve taken to improve the deposit mix thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc right so ebrahim let me start off by saying were super excited about the fact that were getting close to our engagement coming to a marriage with flagstar so hopefully as we get closer to our expectation of closing that transaction we look at an asset sensitive institution merging with a liability sensitive institution and were very positive about the outlook of the margin that being said ill have mr pinto go through some of the details on where we think given the most recent changes of interest rates and how that would impact indiscernible company john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so when we look at the margin we were very happy with the second quarter as it continued the expansion of our margin that really has begun since the fourth quarter of and as tom mentioned in his opening remarks the flagstar deal does provide many benefits and one of them is combining an asset sensitive institution into our liability sensitive balance sheet so in order to illustrate this we looked at the third quarter and if we assumed that the flagstar deal closed on july we estimated what the net interest margin would look like excluding prepayment fees and would come out to be approximately so therell be a basis point increase to what we reported as margin ex prepay in the second quarter when we look at the overall benefit would be about basis points and what that entails is the basis point reduction that we would on a stand alone basis expect to see in the third quarter this assumes the basis point increase later today and a basis point increase in september which is what currently is consensus and also it doesnt include any of the impacts new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 from purchase accounting as we believe that will be beneficial but wouldnt be as material given the flagstar balance sheet which is primarily floating rate on the loan side ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it so just a few followups john for one i think i caught in there basis points standalone nim compression if the deal was closed as of july so just want to make sure thats right and why does flagstar not assume any margin expansion standalone i think if i saw indiscernible the nim was in june and the guidance is in to range is there something oneoff going on there or do we expect the margin to kind of level off thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think what johns saying is that the pro forma margin is anticipated to go up on a combined basis that includes the assets of flagstar merging into nycb john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and if you look at to the investor presentation that flagstar put out they put out a range of to indiscernible right to come up with these numbers reusing the midpoint of that range but you also got to remember if you look at their presentation that they did put on a swap do that has impact to the quarters as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc okay john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc when we put the two companies together that swap will get mark to market ph and removed so that the asset sensitive balance sheet that was that flagstar had back in december will be what we would have going forward so thats really i think the difference ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one separate question tom around the deal obviously sounds like both are still very much on board with the deal just give us an update in terms of where we are to the extent you can in terms of the occ application process and how realistic is an october deal close timeline thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so both teams are very confident we filed our application right after we made the announcement we made the announcement in april that we were moving to the occ i believe in that midmay we filed the application and waiting to hear back from both the occ and the fed and we feel pretty good about where we are and were very focused on our closing date hopefully within that period we have an october deadline in contract that were pushing forward to get the closing done as far as the teams are concerned everyones working on a daily basis new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 its been a very long engagement were looking forward to the marriage and hopefully thatll happen within that timeframe nothing more i can say as far as specificity around the process other than its in the hands of the regulators ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steven how are you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good i wanted to start off with a theoretical question maybe for john if we assume the deal closed and these two banks came together color you just gave to ebrahims question was helpful but once these two banks are together for every basis point increase in the fed funds rate what do you expect your nim to do john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc on a consolidated basis what we would expect is that we will no longer be of course as liability sensitive as we are today well be neutral to slightly asset sensitive so we would expect an increase going forward to the margin but that depends on market conditions and of course the rate increases at the time thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah steven i would just add to that point is that were going to be in a very unique position given the fed ph pivot on interest rates and our ability to look at this combined company positioning it best going forward on the ph balance sheet perspective so if you think about liabilities for example when we started this process of merging with flagstar our liabilities were substantially out of the money in this environment we are probably par to slightly in the money so we have tremendous flexibility of exiting what we call wholesale liabilities and use that opportunity to better position the bank for the long term on the proper funding mechanism on a combined basis as you know ive been very public about this were focusing on gathering better liabilities to fund ourselves more ph commercial bank like the marketplace right now will give us a great opportunity if we have ph balance sheet positioning opportunity so we feel highly new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 confident that when we come together we will look at the balance sheet very carefully and focus on how we can position ourselves best to generate shareholder returns going forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so basically what youre saying tom is when the banks come together we should think of you as being maybe neutral to very slightly asset sensitive but over time you plan to remix the balance sheet make yourself a bit more asset sensitive but thats not going to be the case day thats basically the message right thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think day were focusing on neutral to asset sensitive and well get there with the flexibility of repositioning i want to make this statement very clear the liability base is now significantly closer to par andor in the money that means a year ago that substantial record out of the money liability position has changed in value because of the market condition that gives us a lot of flexibility to figure out how were going to fund this institution without taking consequences to capital to restructure so this gives us more options to think about where the balance sheet is going forward as far as the lines of businesses i think mr pinto was very clear they have no free floating rate so theres not really a lot of negative marks that would be involved in their positioning because its mostly floating rate type of investments and loans so we have some good flexibility there on the funding side at the same time were going to look at our asset classes and focus on the verticals and put the bank in a position to benefit from the current market which is obviously in a rising rate environment now obviously in the long run we want to be more commercial bank ph like indiscernible thatll take time but the focus is the focus on funding for the bank based on loanrelated deposits the company has done a tremendous job the passion here is that when we make a loan we get the deposit balances indiscernible loan thats a cultural change in nycb and weve done some great progress there that is going to be the focus going forward on a combined basis steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats helpful and then final question so if we look at the bankingasaservice deposits can you talk about im trying to understand how these are changing your liability sensitive profile standalone or not so can you talk about the cost of those deposits indiscernible strong growth particularly the fintech bucket in the quarter what did you pay for those deposits in the quarter and are these changing your liability sensitive profile or are you just replacing expensive wholesale funds with basically market rate bankingasaservice deposits in the fintech bucket thanks thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc well steven its a combination of a lot of unique attributes here theres really three functions here so if you think about flagstar they are one of the top originators in the country number six in origination number five in servicing were building our banking as a service in the mortgage side we feel highly confident that when we merge together that could be a substantial business on a combined basis they have lack of a need for certain liabilities given their structure we have a desire to bring in lots of liabilities so the banking as a service ph tied to mortgage clearly is market it is what it is its market and if you have a custodial relationship its close to zero if you dont you work with the customer you have a lending relationship you could work out relationships in respect to reasonable funding and its going to be cheaper than home loan banking advances new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 so yes it does have a cost but we believe its more attractive than home loan bank advances and other wholesale type liabilities when you focus on the government side which again hasnt really kicked in yet but we have tremendous contracts in the work we run the department of new jersey thats one of the few contracts that are currently in the pipeline that were getting benefit from currently rhode island department of labor rhode island department of health the us treasury department which is a substantial potential benefit for this company commonwealth of pennsylvania commonwealth of virginia these are all wins for the bank these roll out over time and the cost of those deposits was zero and when that starts to kick in going forward thats going to be a significant catalyst to our funding position as your cost funding now this takes time to onboard and i dont want to get ahead of myself as far as giving you guidance on when these kick in but we believe over the next to months this will be a very sizable piece of our business in addition we also share in fees so in addition to having a zero cost deposit liability and a tremendous opportunity to get our my banking direct brand out there within the marketplace we also get a sharing of fees and a tremendous benefit on floats the area on the digital side we call it indiscernible fintech relationships so weve been very proactive not only to just bank the client and be a indiscernible for their services but also focus on corporate type accounts that we can now bank their relationships so were working some fabulous headwinds into that particular area but most importantly were seeing results now this is indiscernible shortterm interest rates mr pinto didnt get through the specific details but each deal had its own structure and was very proactive on building this out over time we believe theres a need for a bank of our size to compete against some of the smaller players that are taking the bankingasaservice business model and we feel this has been a very good rampup for the company as an alternative funding solution than a traditional home loan bank advanced market and nontraditional wholesale funding to focus on a diversified deposit needs so john if you want to maybe talk about the funding side as far as cost of those types of liabilities john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah excluding the government piece that tom talked about when youre looking at the mortgageasaservice ph or certainly the bankingasaservice transactions theyre primarily tied to effective fed funds plus or minus spread a small spread usually either way so they are tied to shortterm interest rates but as tom mentioned theres still a more effective funding source than the home loan bank given the inefficiencies potentially in that market so they are just specifically tied normally to effective fed funds thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah plus or minus i think steven one of the attribute of this is very interesting that as we work with these clients and look at opportunities in the banking side we also work with excess liquidity coming off of their actual products that theyre selling in the marketplace so money comes in and out those are all operating accounts indiscernible very nicely for the bank so were looking at it not only as just a baas relationship but as a commercial bank relationship as well and thats been very very positive for past six months steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking all my questions new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you next question is coming from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott your line is now live christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning john and tom can you talk about liquidity and access to liquidity going forward and then also ph maybe mention flagstar they mentioned their drop in liquidity ratio from march to june john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc from a liquidity perspective what weve been doing were in a better spot now than weve been historically especially when you look at on balance sheet liquidity and even some of the cash balances and unencumbered securities that weve been holding on the books so as we continue to pay down home loan bank borrowings our liquidity by bringing in deposits just continues to increase so were very comfortable with the liquidity levels that we have you can see were keeping a little extra cash on the balance sheet to be conservative as we bring in these bankingasaservice customers just to ensure that we fully understand the duration related to them we dont have any surprises so thats why youre seeing some heightened cash and unencumbered securities on our balance sheet which will continue as we continue to bring in deposits and pay down wholesale borrowing so from the liquidity side its we feel very confident where we stand now and the potential to bring in more deposits as we go forward only enhances that thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so chris i would add to johns commentary that weve been very conservative on putting the cash to work john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc weve been waiting on the sidelines given this environment shortterm liquidity to be invested indiscernible spread right now which is advantageous to the bank so weve been very cautious there so were looking forward as we have excess liquidity even with shortterm treasuries ph we can make a spread in that excess christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thats helpful and then on flagstar should we think a bit less about where the ratios are at indiscernible and more about kind of what you will do with it together because you have a lot of optionality as indiscernible new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc absolutely i agree absolutely yes were getting closer christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hopefully well get to the finish line and clearly this is going to be very opportunistic when we look at the choices of the balance sheet on a combined basis christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and one quick one on prepayments any visibility to them staying high for q3 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible some commentary about the mortgage market in our backyard weve had elevated levels and the second quarter was better than the first quarter we see the continuation of that so were very bullish about activity theres pentup refi opportunity there really is a lot of customers that need to come to the table here given theyre coming off of low markets close to now so i believe that will accelerate prepayment activity we see good visibility right now were seeing were going through july we have some good levels in already so i would say still continue with a positive trend but we feel we can go much higher from here if rates continue to trek higher here now obviously if it goes the other way they may wait on the sidelines but we have a decent amount of loans coming due in the next two years and need to make a decision and all of those coupons are out of the money so they would have to pay up to get either just a modification andor refi and were being very selective on what we want to do going forward we feel that in this environment our conservative underwriting standards is key and the fact that turning the coupon for us is more viable than focusing on explosive growth the growth that we have this year for the first half was significantly front loaded i believe if you think about the rest of the year our goal here is ph to turn to coupon well have some moderate growth for the rest of the second half of the year and well still be well above what well say at least meet our expectations of high singledigit net loan growth last year that growth was back loaded this year it seems like it was front loaded so were confident that well meet our goals and objectives of that high singledigit net loan growth number and we also are focusing very carefully on turning the coupon indiscernible low thats very meaningful for the margin going forward christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you tom and thank you john new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you next question is coming from steve moss from b riley securities your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning maybe going back to the bankingasaservice deposits here look like that was backend weighted for the quarter curious if thats primarily due to your ph circle relationship that you announced late in the quarter thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i believe thats part of it its about that particular relationship with a global stablecoin exchange company indiscernible just under billion so the rest is other technology companies on the tax side i did break it out in my prepared remarks so on the tech side of that amount i think it was billion billion is where were focusing on stablecoin exchange and thats for their liquidity requirements on their cash expectations and were one of six banks that service that relationship steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful and then in terms of on liability side here curious on a standalone basis you guys have got i think million or so indiscernible that come due that could come due six months curious what are your thoughts on how youre going to fund them indiscernible near term thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so look i think this goes into the commentary that i discussed about the pro forma balance sheet optionality is on the table here to look at the liability base and the asset base upon consolidation of these two businesses coming together and the flexibility of something thats either in the money indiscernible without any consequences so that gives us lots of flexibility so what weve been doing in the short term weve been either refinancing indiscernible from our prepared remarks were down billion for the first six months and reducing our wholesale dependency on the home loan bank system that is a focus of the bank so clearly having that ph portable position right now at a position that we could be flexible and look at the balance sheet on a goforward basis we look at that as an opportunity clearly if we continue to see deposit growth which we believe we will we have a significant amount of other initiatives working into q3 and beyond were not going to give guidance on deposit growth but were still doing a lot of hard work and bringing in new depository relationships both on the baas side as well as loan related and that will also be a catalyst to deal with advances as they get put back to us new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay and then one more question on the liability side with cds curious what is in the bucket to reprice this quarter at what rate and maybe just trying to figure out what is the dynamic audio gap portfolio in terms of like the average duration john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right so if youll look at indiscernible couple of different pieces so if you look at our maturing cds in the third quarter its billion and thats about a basis point rate so weve had a really good quarter in the second quarter with retention of our cds so when you look at our current cd rates of nine months is about months two years is around give or take so we brought in money under in the second quarter it will be up a little of course in the third but we dont think it will be dramatically higher than that given what weve seen so far this quarter and that the september indiscernible happens so late in september when you look on the borrowing side you mentioned the puttables what our thoughts are there its only about million of wholesale borrowings that are actually maturing in the quarter and thats at a steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc all right thank you very much i appreciate all the color john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure you got it operator thank you next question is coming from bernie vongizycki from deutsche bank your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi hey good morning so my first question is on loan growth you had solid loan growth during the quarter in your prepared remarks you noted the multifamily portfolio you continue to gain market share as competition abates i was wondering first if you could talk to the competitive environment and what youre seeing there and then just any color on the rebound in specialty finance and then just on cre indiscernible hasnt been growing there for some time just anything might be keeping you cautious there thank you thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure so id say big picture were a conservative underwriting shop were very focused on continuing holding to our standards of conservatism so going forward and then part of our culture is that we underwrite on a cash flow basis and if deals are tightened or they dont make sense theyll leave the portfolio and were very comfortable new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 with that and thats our philosophy we feel very good about the loan book or ltvs the business in hand and the new york city marketplace and were also working with some of our flagship customers that are moving outside of new york and building out their businesses away from new york city and thats been very successful and at the same time as we move with them were also working very hard to bring in the full depository relationships so thats been a success for the bank and historically the bank has always had a focus on strong underwriting criteria when you think about the marketplace today we are focusing on obviously moving the coupon higher being very selective on indiscernible retail and office so you dont really see a whole lot of activity there for years now weve been not focused on that from time to time we have good customer relationships that have a diversified portfolio and well consider financing it but the focus has been in our niche business being the multifamily nonluxury marketplace and weve done a very strong job over the past months on getting back to a growth story with that being said i would say in my prepared remarks we had interesting backloaded growth last year it was slow in the beginning of and at the end of we had a surge of activity given the shift of interest rates that continued into the first half of and we think that was a frontloaded story with that being said i feel very confident that well meet our target of high singledigit net loan growth for the company on both multifamily as well as specialty finance on specialty finance we had a couple of years of uncertainty on utilization given the general economy covid and the supply chain issues that seems like that has changed quite a bit for us so a lot of that has been drawdowns the good news there is that these are well underwritten credits that were very comfortable with and more importantly theyre committed for any drawdown and we get nice returns indiscernible of that book is floating rate and thats been an explosive six months i dont want to envision that same type of activity for the second half of this year but i think specialty finance even in a flat scenario had a phenomenal year itll probably grow a little bit this year but on a managed perspective and i think the target for the company is high singledigit net loan growth with the focus on really moving the coupons within the portfolio and were focusing very actively on that bucket of loans that are coming due to reprice and their option comes due and were being creative there to get them to the table sooner so they can move that low coupon into our high low coupon and that will add value to the margin bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great if i could just one more question this is for flagstar so i know the gain on loan sale was million in and i believe in the deck youre guiding flat in i know a few quarters ago there was guidance on the expected ebo gain on sales and just want to get an update on how much you had in the first half of this year any expectations for the second half and just wondering if these kind of finish and theyll be done by this year or if any of that spills into lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah a indiscernible well let yeah well let lee take that one new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah sure so in the second quarter we had just under million ebo gain what i would tell you is as we move forward the ebo gains are going to be relatively neutral you might get a little bit similar to q2 but it isnt going to make a meaningful difference to the quarters gain on sale and with the rising rate environment thats because you cant securitize them all at a gain and so those that were securitizing at a gain in some instances are being offset by those that are under water and so weve made the decision in certain instances to just keep them on the balance sheet in portfolio so netnet youre not going to see a big impact from ebo as it relates to the gain on sale going forward bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks guys operator thank you next question today is coming from matthew breese from stephens your line is now live matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning matthew matthew breese q analyst stephens inc curious what is the standalone new york unity nim outlook for the third quarter thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think john gave it right indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah nim exprepay down bps matthew breese q analyst stephens inc down bps okay and then could you provide within that what the period and spot rate was for new york community deposits as a whole what was the cost of deposits at the end of the period john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 at the end of june matthew breese q analyst stephens inc yes john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc ill get that for you total interestbearing deposits basis points matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay outside of the partnership with circle do you have any other stablecoin relationships that we should be aware of and just given some of the disruption in that market could you just talk to the quality of those relationships if you do have others and some of the dynamics of how they keep the stablecoin stable thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so we have none other than the one that youve mentioned were very confident in indiscernible positioning as a global exchange indiscernible as indicated we are a cash provider for obviously one of six banks that holds cash for their liquidity requirements its not focused on a combined basis where were comingled its clearly just a cash positioning and were one of those one of the six banks that provides banking services to them to have a percentage of their allocation to cash i believe if you recall there were liquidity requirements of every dollar that need to invest needs to be invested in cash and i believe the other is in shortterm treasury so usdc happens to be obviously one of the most stable stablecoins were very comfortable with that relationship and were working on a number of initiatives in respect to potential partners in the future but clearly when it comes to our positioning its really just the corporate cash account that we have with our partnership there matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it great okay the last one for me is just to get a temperature check on obtaining regulatory approval for the deal from a corporate structure standpoint the flagstar deal has a few moving pieces one of which is flagstar seeking a national bank charter within the occ versus an fsa im curious if any critical milestones at this point have been reached and approved and if you can speak to any of them including that national bank charter switch thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible obviously we believe indiscernible just clarify saying we feel very confident where we are as indicated we filed our application in midmay were coming to the end of july and things are progressing but ill push that over to sandro sandro alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 yeah thank you tom no i dont have anything to add relative to the regulatory status were working through the process and as tom said we remain confident that well get the approvals we need as it relates to the national bank piece of it so flagstar weve been considering moving to a national charter since that option became available to us a couple of years ago when congress passed a bill that included that provision and its just sensible to do it in parallel with this application so theres dont read anything into the national bank piece of it its just an easy way to get there and we would have gone there if we were independent we would have gone there because were not as thrift like as we used to be and as you think about that going forward the national bank charter just makes a lot more sense for our organization and for the combined organization as well so again dont read anything into that theres no complication associated with the application because of the national bank piece of it matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thats all i had appreciate taking my questions thank you operator thank you next question is coming from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning maybe john a couple clarifying questions to make sure i heard you right the spot deposit cost was basis points for the entire quarter is that also you said it was also the june cost john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no that was the average right not the spot sorry about that correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no worries do you have the indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no i dont have that with me thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible follow up with that new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great and then did you provide like you typically do the expectation for expenses for the quarter sorry i may have missed that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah ph very consistent where we were in the second quarter and the first quarter were comfortable with our original guidance in that ph range we beat it by a little bit in the first two quarters we think well be there christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the last one given the markets expectation that were in some sort of a slowdown in the economy can you just speak to what you think as normalized losses for that indiscernible book given some of the cyclicality there thanks thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so just in general i mean we havent had a 30day delinquency in nine years so were pretty confident on underwriting and then were a credit ph buyout shot there we do a great job on sourcing through what makes sense for the bank going forward it is a unique business model for us it doesnt come with funding but we are focused on the credit side so we have not had a 30day delinquency in nine years and so we dont envision any real losses there but maybe john can specifically talk about on indiscernible perspective how that would kick in john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah even from a indiscernible perspective where the modeling comes out very low losses historically and currently given what weve seen i mean theres just so the collateral on it is just so strong the performance has been so strong as well so the risk ratings on that portfolio are extremely low so its a very very high credit portfolio that weve built over the last almost years thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah indiscernible secure looking forward to the repricing of it obviously we managed it for the past decade in the low interest rate environment and this elevated interest rate environment on the short end of the indiscernible some good benefits on the yield side there christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator thank you we reached the end of our questionandanswer session id like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments new york
