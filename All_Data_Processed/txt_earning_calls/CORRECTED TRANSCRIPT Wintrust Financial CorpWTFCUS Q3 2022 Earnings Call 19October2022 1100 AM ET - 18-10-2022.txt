conference call over to mr edward wehmer wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you very much welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call with me are dave dykstra dave stoehr kate boege our general counsel tim crane and rich murphy as the same format as usual ill give some general comments regarding our results turn over to tim crane wholl do detail on the balance sheet and the margin dave dykstra then will discuss other income and other expense in detail rich probably will then discuss credit back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future then as always time for questions first of all i will tell you i did survive my back surgery was out a couple of months which probably or a couple of weeks which is probably the reason for the numbers being as good as they are this quarter but all is well here and the indiscernible has been greatly exaggerated so im back in the saddle for the quarter income of million up for second quarter diluted earnings per share of up from the previous quarter on a pretax preprovision basis i think its a record for us million our net interest margin at is moving up nicely the beach ball is coming out somewhere that the beach ball might be suffering from the bends going so fast so keep an eye on that though return on assets return on equity return on tangible equity net overhead ratio is up a little bit but we expected our overall indiscernible yeartodate is but this quarter as dave will discuss we had indiscernible compensation because of how other quarters going lets see credit front rich probably will talk about that but we did have one large credit come in basically that took up a lot of the makes up a lot of the more all of the increase really but we did have a couple of bigger ones roll off too but we think thats adequate coverage rich will talk about that assets we closed at billion loans were up billion or more up million when you think of average versus quarterend we started this quarter with a nice head start and i mean it was good going forward in that from that in that regard deposits are up million we need to start pushing deposits very hard to keep up with our loan growth weve got a lot of ideas there and they are being instituted as we speak for our lowercost deposits to come in with that im going to turn it over to tim take it away timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp great thanks ed a couple of balance sheet items and then several items of interest including the continued impact of rising rates on margin expectations ed mentioned the billion of loan growth thats annualized and importantly its spread nicely across all loan categories in addition the periodend loan balances ed also mentioned million higher than the quarter average which will help our fourth quarter results were encouraged by stable loan pipelines we believe that loan growth in the mid to highsingle digits on an annualized basis remains a reasonable expectation given the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 the million worth of deposit growth affected by the rapid rise in rates combined with fed balance sheet actions is making deposit gathering more challenging and the cost of deposits are rising interestbearing deposit costs of basis points for the quarter were up basis points and will continue to trend up we obviously anticipate continued increases in both the fed funds rate and the rate associated with the banks loan and deposit activities increases in loan yields at this point of the cycle continue to exceed the change in deposit costs given our assetsensitive position our deposit betas and the increase in deposit costs todate are in line with our expectations we anticipate an interestbearing deposit beta of approximately over the full cycle and are currently operating below that level our securities book remained essentially unchanged in the quarter at quarter end liquidity remains strong with approximately billion of interestbearing cash on the balance sheet early in the fourth quarter we deployed approximately billion of the excess liquidity in the higher yielding securities with attractive spreads as we discussed last quarter our securities book is approximately available for sale and held to maturity during the quarter the rise in interest rates resulted in an additional taxadjusted unrealized loss of approximately million on the afs securities while thats material the tangible book value of remains stable compared to this time last year with respect to rate sensitivity in the margin first although our gaap position is down slightly we remain asset sensitive and wellpositioned to benefit from continued rising rates as a reminder and this is outlined on page of the presentation approximately by dollars of our loans reprice or mature within a year second as we experience increasing rates we continue to believe each basis point increase in the fed funds rate will generate approximately million in pretax net interest income on an annualized basis to be more specific on the margin ed mentioned the that was up basis points for the quarter with rates rising rapidly weve exceeded the margin improvement that weve discussed or projected on prior calls at this point depending mostly on the impact of competition for deposits we believe a margin in excess of is possible for the fourth quarter with the margin approaching at some point during the first quarter also depending on the pace and magnitude of fed funds increases perhaps worth noting during the quarter the bank entered into several interest rate collars these collars with terms between three and five years essentially provide some margin protection in the event that rates fall again to very low levels for the quarter capital ratios were stable to down slightly but remain appropriate given our risk profile and as we also discussed last quarter with higher rates and more typical loan growth the companys earnings are projected to result in organic improvement to capital levels in the coming quarters overall a pretty clean quarter and with that ill turn it over to dave david l stoehr chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp all right thanks tim ill cover the noteworthy income statement categories starting with net interest income for the third quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million as compared to the third quarter of the million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in the net interest margin and loan growth wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 the net interest margin as and tim referred to improved basis points from the prior quarter to the beneficial increase of basis points on the yield on earning assets and a basis point increase in the net free funds contribution combined with a basis point increase for the rates paid on liability resulted in the improved margin the increase in the yield on earning assets in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a basis point improvement on loan yields and a higher liquidity management asset yield as the company earned higher shortterm rates on interestbearing deposits held at banks the increase in the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities in the third quarter as compared to the prior quarter was driven by a basis point increase in the rate paid on interestbearing deposits turning to provision for credit losses wintrust recorded provision for credit losses of million compared to provision of million in the prior quarter and the million negative provision recorded in the year ago quarter the provision expense was lower in the third quarter partly as a result of providing for strong but lower loan growth compared to the second quarter a lower level of net chargeoffs and improvement in the mix of classified loans and that was offset slightly by changes in various macroeconomic factors rich murphy will cover credit which continues to be good and additional detail in just a few minutes turning to noninterest income and noninterest expenses in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue was up million to million from million on the prior quarter and up from million recorded in the year ago quarter given the volatile market conditions were pleased with that result which was aided by strong activity in our exchange business consistent with overall industry trends and the impact of higher home mortgage rates our mortgage banking operations saw the anticipated lower loan origination volume during the third quarter as such mortgage banking revenues decreased by million from the second quarter of and looking forward on our current pipeline activities we expect mortgage origination volumes to be lower in the fourth quarter than we just experienced in the third quarter due to the higher rate environment and seasonal purchasing trends however the impact of any such decline on net earnings is expected to be small and very small relative to the anticipated growth in net interest income the company recorded net losses on investment securities of million during the third quarter compared to net losses of million in the prior quarter as the market decline in equity valuations continued to affect a portion of our securities portfolio other noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter which was up million from the amount recorded in the prior quarter the primary reason for the increase in this category is that the company recorded million of losses in the second quarter of this year associated with the sale and anticipated sale of two properties which did not obviously occur again in this quarter additionally the company realized million of lower swap fee revenue in the third quarter relative to the prior quarter on the noninterest expense side of the house the noninterest expenses totaled million in the third quarter and were up or approximately million when compared to the prior quarter total of million the primary reason for the increase was due to higher compensation related expenses salaries and employee benefits expense increased to approximately million in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and relative to the prior quarter the increase related to million of higher salary expense and million of increased accruals associated with our incentive compensation program the higher salary expense was primarily caused by midyear compensation increases which included the effect of rates in the companys minimum wage in august of this year wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 the increase in the commissions and incentive compensation expense was due to higher accruals for both long term and shortterm incentive compensation programs relative to the prior quarter and this was really associated with the increase on the companys profitability and that effect upon the plan design these increases were offset somewhat by lower level of mortgage banking commissions due to declining mortgage loan origination volume other than those categories i just discussed all other expense categories taken together were well controlled and were actually down by approximately million compared to the second quarter the decrease was impacted by a variety of relatively normal operational fluctuations none that i think are worth noting for this call as ed mentioned the net overhead ratio a measure of operational efficiency stood at for the third quarter which was relatively stable when compared to the ratio of in the prior quarter on a yeartodate basis the net overhead ratio stood at additionally the companys efficiency ratio declined below to in the third quarter as expenses did not increase at a rate commensurate with the increase in revenue so in summary the core fundamentals were strong strong loan growth expanding margins solid pipelines good credit quality metrics and i think were set up good for the future quarters so with that ill conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the third quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter was billion or annualized an outstanding result and similar to the past few quarters we continue to see loan growth across the portfolio specifically life insurance premium finance continued to see very solid growth as balances increased million commercial premium finance also had a very strong quarter with loans of million ci loans increased by million and commercial real estate grew by million yearoveryear we saw total loan growth of approximately billion or net of ppp loans as noted on prior earnings calls we continued to see very solid momentum in our core ci and cre portfolios pipelines have been very strong throughout the year and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings during the past several quarters in addition disruptions within the competitive banking landscape continue to work to our benefit we continue to be optimistic about loan growth for the remainder of and early for a number of reasons core pipelines continue to be very strong through q3 with solid momentum going into q4 commercial line utilization excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines as detailed on slide continue to trend up and we anticipate this trend will continue also on slide you will see that business expansion and inflation pressures have resulted in many customers requesting increases to their credit facilities to help finance these costs and both first insurance funding and wintrust life finance had another impressive quarter this momentum has been strong for several quarters and we believe it should continue into as a result while we acknowledge increased concerns about possible recession we believe our diversified portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid to high single digits and maintain our credit discipline wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans increased from million or basis points to million or basis points roughly the same level we experienced at the end of q3 where npls were million or basis points the increase in npls during the quarter came from two factors one loan totaling million within our franchise finance portfolio moved to nonperforming status this loan had been indiscernible for some time as the borrower experienced challenges from extended covid19 shutdowns and more recently by rising wage and commodity cost while these factors have affected other restaurant operators within our portfolio we believe this situation is isolated and our franchise finance customers continue to perform well also we experienced a million increase in npls in our commercial premium finance portfolio resulting from a handful of loans over days past due at quarter end we are secured on these loans and anticipate repayment for the unearned premium shortly overall npls continue to be at very low levels and we are still confident about the solid credit metrics of the portfolio chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points down from the previous quarter yearto date chargeoffs totaled million or basis points finally as detailed on slide we saw significant improvement in our special mention substandard loans with no meaningful signs of economic stress at the customer level that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks rich all in all i think the future is very bright for us notwithstanding what could happen in the markets et cetera i mean those are black swan that jumps in some place but i like where we sit right now we should see continued margin improvement as previous rate increases work their way through our balance sheet and income statement the additional rate increases should also benefit our earnings going forward as we mentioned we have begun to earn in some hedges to predict the downside of rates go down very quickly credit remains stellar and loan demand remains good across the board not sacrifice to a normal conservative credit standards and are making sure we get paid for the risk we continue to benefit from market disruption the acquisition market continue to remain slow indiscernible we are looking as normal for opportunities in all our businesses dilution is still a fourletter word for us but i think that sooner or later people are going to have to start thinking about where theyre going to end up and were the right guys for a lot of people wealth management is doing well because of the cdec the diversified nature of our earnings in that in the wealth management is serving us well as the market turns wealth management should do extremely well i really like where we stand as always you can be sure of best efforts and we appreciate your support now we can do some questions thank you very much wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets jon arfstrom your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi arf how are you doing man jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc doing good how about you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp living the dream every day jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good you sound good can you guys talk a little bit about the comment where you talked about some deposit strategies to have funding grow along with loan growth its been a struggle for some of your peers but just curious what youre thinking on that edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp tim ill let you answer that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah jon we grew deposits less than we normally would in the quarter its obviously become more price sensitive in the market but we continue to add relationships the disruption will continue to help us were working on kind of some more niche depositrelated activities that we think might bear some fruit but were currently at loantodeposit which is well within our target range weve got ample liquidity and could fund several more quarters of unbalanced growth if we get it if loan growth proves to be strong after that which would probably be really good news wed be funding those loans at closer to the higher market marginal rates but our intent is to grow deposits and more importantly grow relationships and the disruptions helping us were encouraged todate that the percentage of deposits that are not interestbearing have stayed pretty stable at about athird of deposits and now were off to a good start in the fourth quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats helpful and i guess the other side of the balance sheet too maybe this is one for you dave but you talked about putting some of the cash to work and having a plan to do more of that can you talk a little bit more about what youre doing there and give us an idea of what you did during the quarter and what kind of yields youre seeing david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean as we stated in the press release we put about billion of the liquidity to work in the fourth quarter those were invested in mortgagebacked securities i dont recall the exact to the basis point yield but it was in a sort of range so weve added some securities we didnt do any really in the third quarter we stayed relatively flat as far as growth goes for investments but we did have some additional federal home loan bank funding where we locked in some lower rates and basically youre getting a spread on those that would be accretive to our roa jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yes going forward i guess going forward jon maybe what youre asking is beyond that do we expect to invest a lot in securities and i think the answer probably is not a lot because we have good loan demand so for us were going to fund a loan demand and use that liquidity to do that and so i would expect that the securities arent going to grow dramatically from here going forward edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we run to loan to deposits so ph on your growth youre going to have something going into securities going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah its just some of your peers have really been beat up on aoci and it doesnt seem like a bigger issue for you but that was what the question surrounded was around as well so i appreciate it thanks guys david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks jon wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 operator thank you our next question comes from david long of raymond james your line is open david long david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you hey im glad to hear your surgery went well and hope your physical therapy is going just as well edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well ill be doing i got days to before i can really do anything but ill be out david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc please stick with it just on the lending side i know it sounds like your pipeline is still very good and you guys are anxious and have an appetite to continue to lend but are there any segments that you may be pulling back on at this point that may seem a little bit more risky than others edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp rich richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think as ed has always said our loan policies are we keep them very conservative we dont change it we dont as i always say we dont like to jerk the wheel and pull in and out of different categories but i would think one of the areas that would be probably impacted the most would be cre as rates go up it just makes it tougher and tougher to have these projects that were looking at underwriting it just requires more and more equity so itll be interesting to see how that goes and clearly in the past as you know it david we in the cre space we already have a number of years ago really worked our appetite down for retail id say office is another area that we are focused on pretty dramatically but overall were still seeing good demand in multifamily and in industrial although again i think its going to start to feel some of the challenges here of higher borrowing costs so but generally speaking were still feeling pretty good about the other areas i think premium finance will continue to do very well through next year ci demand as we talked about with whats going on in the competitive landscape in chicago i think we continue to be a really good opportunity for borrowers and customers bringing over their relationships but that would be the only area that would jump out at me as being heavily affected and something that is were focusing on pretty consistently edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we dont do a lot of consumer lending which is helpful richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah we dont we have home equity but generally speaking thats the extent of most of our consumer lending david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it no i do recall the ropeadope strategy in the commercial real estate way back when so cool thanks for that answer and then texas capital announced theyre selling their premium finance business to truist during the quarter and just within your own premium finance business can you talk about whether that is a good opportunity for you guys to gain some market share or not david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yes dave this is dave dykstra right i think generally we think that if you lose a competitor in the space thats good for us and so i think generally people thought in the pc space the four big players to be a private company out of kansas city truist us and texas capital so if texas capital sells to truist you now have one less competitor in that group of four so i think generally thats a positive for us number of our agents and brokers want multiple premium finance providers and so if for instance they were using texas capital and truist then theyre going to have to find another provider and we would be a likely candidate for that and then to a certain extent truist has also got an insurance agent and broker business and some of our agents and brokers dont like to direct business to a competitor so we think marginally that helps us a little bit too since we are not in the insurance brokerage business so we dont represent that competition against some of our clients so generally speaking i mean its a competitive industry you got to fight for every client but we think it should be a positive just because of one less competitor in the marketplace david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc dave i will ph take that back and let someone else jump in david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan race nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co hi guys good morning wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible on the mortgage outlook from here obviously some compression on the gain on sale margin here in the third quarter so dave maybe just curious how youre kind of thinking about that margin going forward despite of all the adjustments and corrections that are going on in that industry today david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well as i said in my comment i think the volume will be down a little bit because of the seasonality and the increased rates the margins are sort of clinking along what i would think would be the bottom right now so i dont expect those to go down much further we dont i think as you point out we dont do correspondent or wholesale so a lot of the adjustment for some of our peers out there they do a lot more correspondent which i think drives that margin down quite a bit ours is all retail and we dont deal in those other pillars of the mortgage business so i would think that the margin would be about the same on lower volume and so revenues will ex msr valuations et cetera revenues or production revenue will be down slightly but again once you take out the commissions the expenses and taxes the impact of that is going to be negligible relative to the increase in net interest income nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just changing gears and thinking about the deposit outlook just going back to the earlier question curious just in terms of your guys ability to kind of defend the deposit base and actually grow it unlike most peers thus far in the earnings season is the deposit growth youre seeing largely from existing clients or are you guys seeing more opportunities to grow deposits just in light of all the acquisitionrelated disruption across the chicago land area these days edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp tim why dont you handle that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah nate its really both i mean the disruption is certainly helpful and as we bring clients over we aim for a full relationship which would include the deposit business but were sensitive to the deposit book and the excess funds that all of our clients have and we will compete with for those with everybody in the market so its both nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and just lastly do you guys have an updated range in terms of where you want your loantodeposit ratio to settle out into next year in light of maybe perhaps tamping down on some growth just to maybe keep that loanto deposit ratio within the more comfortable range going forward wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah weve said to low nate i dont think we would change that kind of for normal operating conditions david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah thats been our preferred range nate for every year that weve been a public company going back to so that were comfortable there nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i will step back i appreciate you guys taking my questions and all the color edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens inc your line is open please go ahead terry mcevoy terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good morning first off im glad the surgery went well and gosh i cant imagine a wintrust call without you so i just want to get that out there so from a i guess first question as you think about that margin in the first quarter of next year and the upside to revenue does that make you rethink your expense budget all for next year and can you push back at all on some of the concerns that banks spend away this higher nii on expenses next year david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well indiscernible this is dave i think that we have a threeyear plan for technology investments and the like and well stick to that were not going to spend like drunken sailors i think that well have continued to see pressures on labor costs next year but that is not a function of spending the money we make on the margin just randomly so were going to try to control the expenses as best we can as if the margin didnt increase and well continue to invest in technology and expand the franchise as we normally would could there maybe be a marginal project out there that maybe was on hold that we would throw into the kitty possibly but it wouldnt be material edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i think thats right dave and i think that yeah be really careful on your expenses going forward because what comes up could come down and although were doing some things to hedge the downside risk of rates falling again the fed is so active and somebody hiccups someplace and were going to get our answers handed to us in rates again we cant afford to have that and were going to work very hard on that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 but the fact is that i think that our prospects for growth are very good i think the growth will help mitigate a lot of these expenses because youre going to have increases in labor and what have you theyre not going to come back at the end of the day were going to have to build that in and then were going to go through it so the organic growth and hopefully the acquisition market will come around again but weve always been able to work through and take what the market gives us and well continue to do that i think our reputation and the market in chicago being somewhat still kind of in turmoil with changes going on i think the opportunities for us here are still very good geographic expansion in our market in our desired marketplace is also very good i should note that were opening up a weve opened up a loan production office and soontobe branch in indiana kind of west indiana which is good for us we prefer to buy somebody there but maybe theyll sell to us and i guess well be like sweet worms or something but were going to make it going into that market i think that the way we our culture the way we operate the organization the way we present ourselves to our customers as indicated by the jd power awards we get and the greenwich awards we get will sell sells very nicely into these new communities at very transportable i should say so we hope they will grow through it and that would be the plan terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a followup and im a bit over my skis here could you maybe talk about the decision to use the collar where youve got to establish a floor and a cap versus just a straightup swap what type of protection do you have there just so i can understand the decision and then going forward do you think that downrate scenario which went from to negative do you expect that to continue to trend down over the coming quarters through the use of additional swaps or collars edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp dave or tim david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah we havent disclosed what the outside parameters of those are but well put that detail into the q terry but generally speaking its probably mid to low as far as where the cap would kick in and then in the mid to high for some of the floor where they would kick in well give specifics in 10q and go through that its just a start on that so were trying to protect the downside and the thought is if you sell the cap on that it helps to pay for the downside protection and because were so asset sensitive giving up a few basis points on the upside is worth paying for the downside protection terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open please go ahead chris mcgratty wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wondering if you just start if you had the september margin and also the spot deposit cost at the end of the quarter david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah no we havent disclosed those chris i think what were going with the margin is we expect it to be north of in the fourth quarter and so you can probably sort of draw a straightline if you look at where we went from second quarter to third quarter and the guidance we gave for the fourth quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the approaching in q1 obviously at a much better than what markets are expecting i guess maybe a question around peak margins or peak nii growth how are you thinking about just the if the fed stops early next year how much of a lag therell be on the deposit indiscernible side and what youre doing to kind of protect that roll over edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i mean chris were our assumption right now is for another basis points worth of fed funds increases probably basis points in november and then basis points at some point after that at those levels we get the approach to during the first quarter i think as the fed stops raising rates its more likely that the loan and asset repricing will mitigate deposit increase costs which lag somewhat so theres lots of moving parts but the low4 range is certainly reasonable given the current forecast and if you things change well move accordingly christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so low after the first quarter is based on that assumption is what youre communicating okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brandon king of truist your line is open please go ahead brandon king brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah so i had a question on the reserve currently the ph acl is at basis points and i know its higher than it was prececl and day one cecl but im curious what is your level of comfortable comfort with that going into kind of a economic environment thats deteriorating and if you think thats adequate for a more severe recession or how high it could go david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well we obviously think its adequate and thats what weve stated if we look at our models then one of the things you need to understand is that that basis point incorporates over a third of our balance sheet and premium financed loans and life loans are historically if you look at it have zero losses and the pc portfolio has relatively low losses so if you look at table of our press release if you look at our core loans we have basis points of reserve associated with those but clearly with the cecl modeling and the work that we do on that we think its adequate when you go back to the timeframe we were profitable in all of those years and generally had lower losses than our parent we think were conservative we monitor it we deep dive deep into our portfolios and look for trends and right now we feel comfortable with where its at but you do theres people that maybe dont follow us closely and they need to understand that that number is lower than some of our peers because we have a third of our portfolio in very low risk low loss asset classes brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then following that im not sure if you disclosed kind of the weightings but there is some sort of a qualitative overlay in particular that you think kind of gives you more comfort with that reserve level that you put on based off of the calculations with the cecl indiscernible david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah we dont disclose the difference between quantitative and qualitative factors out there but i think everybody has a qualitative process factored in ours generally is a qualitative process based on quantitative analysis and input from the lines but i think the answer to the question is were very comfortable with our reserve levels brandon king q analyst truist securities inc well done thanks for taking my questions edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you at this time id like to turn the call back over to ed wehmer for closing remarks sir wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 edward
