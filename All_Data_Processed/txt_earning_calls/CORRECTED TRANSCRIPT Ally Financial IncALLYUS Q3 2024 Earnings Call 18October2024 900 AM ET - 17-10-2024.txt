that ill turn the call over to michael ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 michael george rhodes chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you sean good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call ill begin on slide before we get into the quarter i want to share my perspective on a few key items after almost six months in the role im incredibly excited about the future of ally but recognize we face some earnings challenges over the next few quarters russ will get into the details of this in a few moments as for the future im very encouraged by many of the underlying trends in our core businesses we have outstanding franchises in dealer financial services ally bank and corporate finance on the auto side we continue to win business with compelling riskadjusted margins and growth in our insurance business continues to create strong fee revenue at the bank deposits are contributing more margin than at any point in the companys history and corporate finance is on pace for its highest annual earnings ever in terms of financial results adjusted eps of includes significant tax credits within the period this is related to ev lease volumes which well cover shortly that said core pretax income of million does not reflect what the company is capable of we can do better we continue to navigate a dynamic operating environment that includes volatility in interest rates and the consumer that has been strained by cumulative inflationary pressures the unique environment has contributed to more volatility in our nearterm outlook particularly on credit costs and margin stepping back from quarterly fluctuations our mediumterm outlook is predicated on a few simple drivers in which i have a lot of confidence first we have taken and continue to take action to reduce the loss content of our originations we believe these actions will result in lower losses over time second we have a liabilitysensitive balance sheet heading into a falling rate environment in addition were running off lowyielding assets that are drag on margin today so we continue to have momentum on both sides of the balance sheet now we cant predict the exact path of fed funds or when market rates for deposits will move but we expect they will move lower which will accelerate margin expansion in addition to margin and credit improvements we continue to be relentlessly focused on capital and expense discipline im so proud of the way our team is driving controllable expenses down this year following many years of increases and weve been successful taking actions to move cet1 higher to ensure we support our customers and build excess capital rest assured our focus on expenses and capital management will remain a top priority were looking very closely at resource allocation and well continue to prioritize whats in the best interest of our shareholders so lets put it all together ally has a strong franchise positioned for margin expansion and revenue growth combined with improving loss trends and tightly managed expenses and capital i expect that this will translate into a mid teens return over time lets turn to slide and talk about our marketleading franchises in auto we decisioned million consumer applications this gives us the ability to be selective in the loans we book in terms of pricing and credit with respect to pricing we generated billion of consumer volume and our auto origination yield of was consistent with prior quarter despite a meaningful reduction in swap rates over the past several months in terms of credit we originated more than of volume in our highest credit tier again this quarter our ability to sustain strong margins and consistent credit quality in a competitive market demonstrates the strength of this franchise insurance written premiums of million represents a quarterly record since our ipo and highlight the opportunities we have in fi and pc products ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 turning to ally bank retail deposits of billion are fdic insured and we are proud to serve million customers weve been very intentional about creating a comprehensive value proposition that goes well beyond our consistently competitive rates we offer bestinclass customer service and convenient digital experiences and over time have added additional features and products and weve seen consistently high level of satisfaction engagement and retention the combination of a strong national brand and a comprehensive value proposition allows us to leverage our deposit franchise to drive nim expansion from here given our funding needs retail deposits declined million within the quarter which is in line with our expectations as loan balances also declined on a linked quarter basis deposit customer growth remained strong up within the quarter new accounts continued to show high levels of engagement which should result in less pricesensitive balances in the portfolio corporate finance assets increased modestly quarteroverquarter and the portfolio continues to generate strong returns and solid credit performance within credit card im pleased with how the team proactively managed risk resulting in a decline in losses from the prior quarter the business has attractive cardholder base a great digital experience and is producing a doubledigit riskadjusted margin even in this environment underlying business trends are strong and our customercentric approach positions us to continue winning in the marketplace and with that ill turn it over to russ russell e hutchinson chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks michael good morning everyone ill begin on slide in the third quarter net financing revenue excluding oid of billion was lower yearoveryear driven by lower average earning assets and higher cost of funds the decline in benchmark rates as the fed continues to move rates lower will be a tailwind over the medium term given the liabilitysensitive nature of our balance sheet but as weve covered previously we are modestly assetsensitive in the near term as floating rate assets and hedges will contractually reprice faster than deposits we expect to achieve our mediumterm nim target of but the rapid change in fed funds implied by the forward curve will create some volatility in the next few quarters if those cuts materialize ill discuss margin dynamics in more detail shortly adjusted other revenue of million is up from the prior year as we continue to benefit from the momentum within insurance and other revenue streams provision expense of million increased from the prior year driven by higher net chargeoffs and a basis point reserve build in retail auto to reflect our outlook on net chargeoffs going forward including potential losses from hurricane helene as i previewed at a recent conference net chargeoffs continue to be elevated in the quarter driven by pressure in latestage delinquent accounts ill cover retail auto credit and vintage dynamics in more detail later adjusted net interest expense of billion reflects our continued focus on tightly managing expenses even while continuing to make accretive investments to support the growth of our insurance business and necessary investments in areas such as cybersecurity continued momentum in ev lease originations drove million in ev tax credits and a negative tax rate within the quarter we will also provide more on ev originations later gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of decreased basis points from the prior quarter earning asset yields decreased basis points quarteroverquarter driven by lower lease revenue retail auto portfolio yields excluding the impact from hedges increased basis points this quarter the linked quarter ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 expansion slowed relative to prior periods as latestage delinquency buckets drove a higher proportion of loans moving to nonaccrual status on liabilities cost of funds increased basis points quarteroverquarter retail deposit yields were flat quarter overquarter while brokered deposits drove a modest increase in total deposit costs notwithstanding nearterm choppiness the pricing dynamics on both sides of our balance sheet support nim expansion to our medium term target lets discuss net interest margin in more detail on slide over the medium term were wellpositioned for nim expansion as the deposit portfolio including consumer cds reprices lower in addition to the tailwinds from our liabilitysensitive balance sheet the favorable asset mix shift of the balance sheet will support margin expansion throughout so in the medium term were confident nim will move higher but want to provide context on the timing dynamics that will factor into nim progression the graphic on the bottom of the page illustrates nim drivers as we move through the fed easing cycle this is not a specific forecast rather its a simple way to think about the dynamics impacting our nim if the fed moves rates materially lower over the next few quarters as youd expect changes in the pace and magnitude of fed cuts will impact each of these variables particularly in the shorter term on deposits we continue to expect a throughthecycle beta of around which is consistent with our experience during the tightening cycle and prior easing cycles but we expect that downward beta to be lower to start and then increase over time again thats consistent with what we saw in and on the way up we have begun to move deposits down including basis points last month and basis points in total including the actions we took earlier this year in retail auto our origination yields remain higher than the back book and we expect the portfolio yield excluding hedging to move higher over the next few quarters and the continued shift from mortgage loans and securities into retail auto and corporate finance loans will be a consistent tailwind going forward across those three primary drivers we have significant margin tailwinds floating rate assets and our hedge position are temporary offsets floating rate assets are mainly commercial loans in both auto and corporate finance we also include cash balances in this bucket those assets will reprice quickly which represents an immediate headwind that grows over time as the fed is expected to reduce rates further hedges have been an effective mechanism to reduce exposure to rising rates hedging activity has contributed more than billion in nii since the tightening cycle and continues to generate significant positive carry that benefit has come down over time which will continue given the decline in benchmark rates and natural maturity of the swaps so in the near term we have contractual repricing of floating rate exposures the expected move in deposit rates will more than offset that headwind over time but the next few quarters may see margins contract modestly the direction of nim movement over the next few quarters is heavily dependent on competitive dynamics and deposits nim in the near term may be choppy but over a variety of rate paths we expect nim expansion in the medium term to reflect favorable dynamics on both sides of our balance sheet turning to page cet1 of was up quarteroverquarter we operate with a significant buffer to required cet1 with over billion of excess capital above our scb minimum that went into effect october within the quarter we saw over million of aftertax aoci accretion given the move lower in interest rates we ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 expect natural aoci accretion of million per year based on the forward curve excluding the impacts of aoci adjusted tangible book value per share is up more than times from we are confident in our ability to continue driving shareholder value and tangible book value per share growth over the next several years we recently announced our quarterly dividend of for the fourth quarter which remains consistent with the prior quarter in the first quarter of we expect a basis point impact to cet1 from the final phasein of cecl and well talk shortly about a potential change in accounting treatment on ev leases which would temporarily reduce cet1 lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends the consolidated net chargeoff rate of basis points was up basis points quarteroverquarter consistent with the first and second quarters of our commercial portfolio has continued to perform well with no chargeoff activity in corporate finance or commercial auto during the quarter the credit card portfolio is performing in line with expectations and both delinquencies and net chargeoffs improved in the quarter credit card ncos of were down from in the prior quarter retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points were up basis points quarteroverquarter driven by seasonal patterns and elevated delinquencies in the bottom right 30plus day delinquencies increased basis points quarteroverquarter and were up basis points yearoveryear slightly higher than our expectations a few months ago ill cover auto credit trends in more detail in a couple of slides retail auto and consolidated coverage rates were up and basis points respectively the increase in coverage rates reflects our updated outlook for retail auto credit loss trends including potential impacts from hurricane helene the retail auto coverage rate will remain elevated until we see loss performance normalize lets turn to page to discuss retail auto underwriting actions the curtailment and pricing actions weve taken over the past two years have meaningfully reduced the risk content of originations and protected riskadjusted returns we opportunistically tightened underwriting and took pricing actions in the second quarter of that resulted in an increase of in stier originations our highest credit quality tier while the moveup tier in credit in was a meaningful pivot were always evaluating strategies to refine the credit buybox we continue to identify segments of underperformance and have taken further action which includes curtailment of originations and higher pricing more recent examples of additional curtailment include tightening credit policy for contracts with higher monthly payments or pti weve increased the frequency with which we require income and employment verification and are more selective around trade equity weve also lowered approvals for applicants in higher debt to income segments and those that have limited credit history these are just a few simple examples but the broader point is while our origination mix may look very consistent over the past plus months we continue to take very granular actions to optimize riskadjusted returns the effectiveness of these actions is reflected in the loan characteristics on the bottom left our moveup in credit was most pronounced in with our stier mix increasing from around in prior years to more than and within the past year weve seen an increase in fico also you can see our pti took a step down from to and again over the last year we continue to be more selective in what were putting on the balance sheet the continued tightening gives us confidence our loss rate will decline over time on slide lets discuss retail auto vintage credit trends retail auto origination trends are on the top half of the page our origination trends reflect a deliberate strategy to be increasingly selective in our underwriting with a ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 focus on prioritizing riskadjusted returns over origination volume we have moved up significantly in terms of borrower credit quality since early which will be a tailwind to delinquency and frequency over time we expect less severity pressure as we move further away from peak collateral values of early while losses remain elevated we are seeing benefits from our underwriting changes our vintage continues to outperform in the aggregate despite a more challenging macro environment after equivalent months on book while not shown on the page the quarterly vintage comparisons from those years show even more separation and the very early signs on the vintage are also encouraging as we move past peak losses on the vintage we expect the rate of change in delinquency and chargeoffs to continue to move lower and ultimately decline on a yearoveryear basis the exact timing of improvement in credit performance is difficult to forecast in this environment particularly as we are managing a larger pool of latestage delinquent accounts but our continuous refinement of the buybox and the results of our detailed vintage analysis give us confidence in lower losses over time moving to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was down from the prior year driven by higher funding costs and provision expense provision reflected typical seasonality elevated net chargeoffs and a basis point increase in the coverage rate on the bottom left weve highlighted the steady progression of retail auto portfolio yields excluding the impact from hedges yields are up basis points year overyear strong application volume drove high credit quality originations including in our stier while maintaining a yield above which is consistent with the prior quarter we continue to prioritize riskadjusted spread over retail loan origination volume and our originated yield has been resilient even as two and threeyear swap rates have moved over basis points lower from the peak earlier this year while we have prioritized credit quality through further curtailment actions we expect originated yields to move lower in the fourth quarter but remain above the back book leading to continued expansion in portfolio yield ex hedges lease trends are in the bottom right gains of million in the third quarter reflect lower lease termination volume and softer lease gains per vehicle we expect lease termination volume to decrease further in and reflective of the industry decline in origination volume three years ago for each respective period turning to slide weve provided an update on ev lease trends ev originations in the third quarter of billion represented of our total origination volume consistent with the prior quarter increased lease volume is driven by the new oem agreement we entered into in march and includes residual guarantees that provide significant protection against the decline in values higher ev lease origination volume generated significant tax credits within the quarter under our current accounting treatment these credits flow through the income statement at the time of origination in addition we also made an adjustment to align our yeartodate tax credit recognition with yearto date earnings as a percentage of fullyear expectation the combined impact from ev volume and the quarterly trueup was million within the quarter in the prioryear quarter ev tax credits impacted our effective tax rate by singledigit percentage points in the third quarter the impact of ev tax credits was larger resulting in a negative tax rate with the ongoing momentum in ev lease volume and to mitigate future tax rate volatility we are evaluating a change in the election of accounting methods from flowthrough method accounting to deferral method accounting ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 a switch to deferral method of accounting would result in the ev tax credit benefit being realized in net interest margin over the life of the lease instead of tax expense on day one under the existing flowthrough method deferral method of accounting for ev lease tax credits would align the recognition of the credit with the economics of a traditional internal combustion engine or ice lease contract a potential change in accounting methods would be made retroactively and reduce retained earnings by approximately million and cet1 by approximately basis points as of q3 importantly the impact to ally would be offset over the life of the lease with higher reported nim in the third quarter nim would have been basis points higher under the deferral method of accounting we expect to decide on the accounting methodology at some point in the fourth quarter and it remains subject to approval from our external auditors turning to insurance on slide core pretax income was up million yearoveryear driven by higher earned premiums and investment income total written premiums of million are a quarterly record for ally since the ipo and reflective of the momentum we see across this business pc written premiums of million are also a record driven by new oem relationships and higher inventory exposure the success weve had growing our insurance business is driving higher losses which are up million yearoveryear these losses are more than offset by revenue hurricane helene occurred during the final week of the quarter and we expect the storm to be among our largest historical hurricane events in terms of gross losses our q3 results reflect our current estimate of insurance losses from helene our reinsurance program is expected to cover most of the loss as we look ahead insurance is a key driver of fee revenue expansion and we remain focused on generating strong premium volume by leveraging relationships in auto finance corporate finance results are on slide core pretax income of million was another strong quarter for corporate finance and highlights the steady return profile of the business endofperiod hfi loans of billion are up million quarteroverquarter our portfolio remains welldiversified virtually all firstlien and we remain wellpositioned from a credit standpoint on the bottom of the page we highlight the accretive return profile of the corporate finance business while balances can fluctuate depending on market dynamics and competition well look to prudently deploy capital into corporate finance to continue serving customers and generating strong returns turning to mortgage on slide mortgage recorded pretax income of million and million of dtc originations consistent with prior quarters heldforinvestment assets continue to decrease as virtually all dtc originations are held for sale our focus remains on providing a great customer digital experience while simultaneously demonstrating efficiency by adapting to different operating environments ill provide an update on our outlook on slide we are updating our fullyear nim outlook to approximately the update assumes another basis point decrease in fed funds by yearend and the assumption that deposit betas will be slow to start given the nearterm asset sensitivity we discussed earlier this puts temporary pressure on margin exiting the year momentum in insurance earned premiums through new oem relationships and continued success in diversified auto channels such as smartauction and passthrough position us to grow adjusted other revenue by yearoveryear thats consistent with our update in july and well above the to we guided to in january we see retail auto ncos of to for the year which results in a total consolidated loss rate of to adjusted noninterest expense guidance is unchanged with controllable expenses expected to be down ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 more than yearoveryear and total expenses up less than we expect average earning assets to increase on a linked quarter basis but still expect to be down approximately this year reflecting our disciplined approach to optimizing riskadjusted returns over origination volume and growth we have adjusted our fullyear guide on tax rate to negative to based on the momentum in ev lease and the update to earnings outlook before i turn it over to michael i want to again reiterate our focus on delivering a midteens return over time we have significant tailwinds based on the strength of our auto and deposit franchises that will drive net interest margin sustainably higher and weve taken the appropriate steps to drive losses lower over time the exact timing of midteens will depend on several factors it will not be a straight line and the combination of temporary margin pressure and elevated losses will be a headwind for the next few quarters but were confident in what the business can deliver and with that ill turn it back over to michael michael george rhodes chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you russ before we get to questions i want to acknowledge the next few quarters will be choppy but i remain confident in our franchise and our ability to deliver compelling returns our deeprooted history in auto is centered on relationships with dealer customers our value proposition remains simple consistently help our dealers succeed in all aspects of their business we have seen the success of this model through record application flows driving strong riskadjusted margins on originations at ally bank our quality retail deposit portfolio is a source of strength what ally has been able to achieve in years is remarkable and the team didnt just build another bank they built a better bank as a leader in the digital banking space im encouraged by the opportunities we have in front of us to remain disruptive and innovative creating differentiated value for our more than million deposit customers our deposits make us liability sensitive and now the fed has begun the easing cycle we are wellpositioned for earnings growth over the medium term we continue to diversify our revenue streams in insurance and auto insurance will generate billion of written premiums this year reflective of new oem relationships and synergies with our auto finance business in auto we continue to further monetize our application volume and see the benefits from our online vehicle auction platform smartauction between nim and fee revenue the momentum we have in total revenues will drive meaningful shareholder value over the medium term credit costs are elevated in a macro environment thats challenging after continued pressure from inflation and low personal savings rates we have managed auto originations through selective underwriting and pricing strategies these changes have been meaningful continuous and informed by granular performance data and with relatively short duration that should drive losses down over the medium term in this environment while we expect net revenues to expand we will continue to be disciplined with expense management we will manage capital dynamically were focused on allocating resources to our highest returning businesses and continuing to organically grow our capital buffer in anticipation of basel iii so let me be clear i am confident in our franchise and ability to deliver compelling returns given the level of macro uncertainty were managing the exact timing of getting those returns will be fluid as ceo im evaluating ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 all aspects of our business and i am committed to growing shareholder value and delivering compelling financial results we will take the actions necessary to accomplish this and with that ill turn it over to sean for qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thank you michael as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one followup elizabeth please begin the qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning ryan how are you ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc good so i appreciate that the next few quarters are going to be choppy and maybe just to start on credit i think russ you noted that you expect the rate of change on losses to move lower over time however if i start in the near term if i look at the midpoint of the guidance i think it implies a fourth quarter loss rate in retail auto could actually see an increase in the yearoveryear loss rate something north of can you maybe just help us think about where we go from here and then i know you both mentioned that youre confident that losses will come down over time as peaks the tighter underwriting from the second half of and come through but do you expect losses to actually be down in thanks and i have a followup russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great thanks ryan maybe ill start with i think we do anticipate the majority of the increase will be seasonality we also include of course the impact of the recent storms which will create some noise granted weve reserved for that and so when you kind of think about delinquency certainly over the next quarters next quarter or so there is some noise there that being said as we discussed we made significant curtailment actions over the course of and and were seeing that in terms of the vintage dynamics and so we do it and that gives us confidence in terms of eventually seeing losses normalize also when you think about used car prices the further we get from peak used car prices back in yeah thats also helpful to us in terms of severity going forward so i think we see a lot of things in terms of credit that ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 were positive about and give us confidence around the mediumterm picture all that being said were carrying an elevated level of dqs it gives us more sensitivity to changes in the macro environment and kind of when we think about this year and fourth quarter were our fullyear guide is for to were probably exiting a little bit higher than that and so that all kind of factors into how we think about as you know as youre accustomed to we typically dont give our guidance until january when we report the full year and were going to stick to that this year as well but i guess to kind of hit to the gist of your question we expect normalization in nco levels over time were not going to call it in terms of a particular quarter just given the volatility that weve talked about and some of the factors in the macro and the delinquencies but again just kind of given what were seeing as we look at the vintage dynamics and just kind of looking at some of the curtailment that weve put in place we feel confident that well see that reduction in ncos over the medium term ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and as my followup appreciate all the new disclosures on the rate sensitivity russ i thought you noted that you expect expansion at some point through if we were to use the forward curve and whatever your deposit pricing expectations are and lets assume theres no changes in the lease accounting for now when do you actually see this nim inflection occurring and can you maybe just talk about the pace of improvement when we do see it historically you talked about to what does that new dynamic look like now and i fully recognize that we wont get fullyear guidance until next year but just trying to understand how youre thinking about the inflection and the pacing over time thanks russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look maybe ill start just by saying nothings changed in our mediumterm outlook for all the factors we described in the prepared remarks as far as the medium term goes the benefit we see from the rollover of the portfolio continued expansion in the portfolio yield just the overall asset mix away from mortgages and securities towards retail auto and corporate finance just the overall kind of pricing of our deposits as we approach a beta in a lower rate environment all of these things point to the same nim that weve talked about before and so theres nothing thats really changed in that respect i think what we wanted to highlight for everyone just kind of given the uncertainty around the rate outlook and how quickly its moved over the last few months is there are these nearterm pressures and these nearterm pressures depend very much on the size of any potential rate cuts the pace of rate cuts as well as just the overall competitive environment for deposits and therefore on the speed at which we get to our deposit beta and so were being careful not to give a quarterly guidance in that environment and not to kind of pin ourselves to any particular quarter but i just want to reiterate that fundamentally nothings changed here and its still our view that were going to get to our nim guide in the medium term ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks russ operator our next question russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 thanks ryan operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the retail auto chargeoff guidance i know you bumped that up to to from the prior weve seen a steady updrift here in that chargeoff expectation and what gives you confidence in this revision that its appropriate and then maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on the vintage side in the vintage how do you expect that to fare versus the vintage given the worse macro backdrop that the vintage was facing russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah those are both great questions john i think in terms of your first question on the revision youre correct we have revised from the to now a fullyear outlook of to and look i dont think what were seeing is a kind of any different than what others are seeing in the auto book of course respectful of the fact that we are a full spectrum lender and that were primarily used vehicles i think were all kind of dealing with a unique set of circumstances that arised coming out of the pandemic in terms of what we saw in where we saw a consumer that was faced with kind of higher prices at the dealership higher used car prices and also just some of the dynamics around excess savings coming out of the pandemic and the inflation that weve seen since in terms of the cumulative impact of inflation on peoples overall budgets and so yeah i think were all dealing with that and were all dealing with kind of elevated loss content across our vintages but in particular with the vintage and that was a large vintage for us here at ally as you know i think as we look at credit bureau data what we see with the credit bureau data for on a likeforlike basis kind of very similar and so again it kind of gives us confidence that what were seeing isnt different from the industry yeah i think our expectations the expectations that kind of form the view of the loss rate for the year assumed some improvement in credit on the basis of the vintage rollover from to that was optimistic and i think thats a key point here is that those expectations were optimistic and so i think nothings changed our expectation is still that well see improvement as we roll forward the vintages from to and we are still seeing separation in terms of delinquency rates at similar time on book and so we are still seeing the vintage outperform and now the early read on is that that is outperforming all consistent with the level of underwriting changes that we made over time and in fact when we look at these vintages on a quarterly basis that separation is even more clear to us and so i think on the overall direction of losses nothings changed but in terms of timing we do acknowledge that theres more uncertainty around the timing of it theres probably more sensitivity to the macro and some volatility in the near term and its probably a longer road to get to more normalized nco levels going forward were not going to put a particular timeline or a particular quarter on when we see it turn at this point but obviously well come back in january and give you and everyone else a more fulsome update in terms of where we are and what we see at that point in time with the benefit of seeing the close of ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks for that russ i appreciate it and then just on capital i know you expressed your intent to continue to build capital off the level cet1 can you just remind us where you would like to see that go to where your target is at this point thanks russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah its a good question im glad you asked because i do want to clarify one point or at least put a footnote on the weve got some headwinds coming over the next couple of quarters as you know weve got the final phasein of cecl coming and thatll kind of take approximately basis points and then we talked about a potential accounting change around how we treat ev lease tax credits if we were to go ahead with that accounting change yeah there would be a cet1 impact there that we talked about in the prepared remarks about basis points and so i did just want to point out that weve got some headwinds that weve got to care for in terms of capital with respect to that i think as we think about the we feel good that it gives us a degree of flexibility as we think about capital going forward we are not looking at capital necessarily in terms of exactly where we are today were looking at capital in anticipation of whats coming with basel iii and as you know the most impactful part of that for us is the inclusion of aoci in cet1 we are awaiting final details of basel iii and were waiting to get the final transition timing or the final phasein timing of basel iii we feel good about our ability to manage through that organically but obviously thats a factor that we think about as we think about our capital from a quartertoquarter period john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you russ russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks john operator our next question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning sorry to beat the dead horse on this credit but maybe just moving to how the cohorts are doing you obviously pivoted to a more conservative underwriting as second quarter onwards i mean are those cohorts behaving like you expected them to like i know youre stier or has something changed even in the behavior of your stier russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah its a good question and sanjay look i would say just as the exhibit that weve presented indicates we continue to see kind of better performance as we roll through the quarters of starting kind of second quarter and going on even through the early quarters of and it gives us confidence that the underwriting changes we made were effective and also as we look at the progressive separation as we go through the ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 quarters which we didnt show but we look at obviously and pay a lot of attention to internally again provides reassurance that the underwriting changes are effective in terms of seeing that separation grow as you progress through the quarters that being said and we talked about this at a recent investor conference in terms of kind of what weve seen in terms of delinquency over the course of july august september the delinquency we saw in the ncos underperformed our expectations and i think part of that as i mentioned in response to an earlier question on credit was just a reflection of i think we had assumptions about improvement based on the rollover of the vintages that were optimistic all that being said the vintages do show that progressive improvement in performance but id say they kind of missed our expectations in terms of just the overall level and that informs our sensitivity around providing any kind of guidance around timing but it also informs again just continuing to see that improvement by vintage also informs our view that we will see ncos come down over time were just not going to give you a specific timeline in terms of a particular quarter in which youd expect to see that michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc russ its probably worth talking about lot of focus obviously here on vintages theres also the notion of severity and one of the unique factors of was just where used car prices were car prices in general or vehicle prices and where theyre trending maybe just a little color on severity also because when you put these two together is i think its what gives some confidence i think it gives a lot of confidence in terms of the fact these trends will shift russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah absolutely and we showed on an exhibit in the presentation the auvi index as a transition through the quarters and you can see we hit peak used car prices in the second quarter of and id say in that environment new car prices were also elevated and consumer selection was very limited and so as we move further away from those peak prices in terms of new and used vehicles we get a good guide from severity and you combine the good guy from severity as well as the impact of progressive changes to our underwriting and again that gives us reassurance and confidence around eventually improving nco levels sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc my followup question michael maybe its for you you obviously commented this im just curious sort of what your take on it is and maybe the question i get from investors or is your feelings on the longterm targets do you think that they might be aggressive or do you feel like they make sense thanks michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc so thanks for the question and may i address the longterm targets first and then the kind of my approach to understanding if you will second like in terms of longterm targets we talk about a midteens return on capital and so i guess the question is what needs to be true in order to achieve that and to me it actually boils down to maybe three factors one credit needs to normalize in the way that we expect second is margin needs to expand to something that looks like around a and there are a number of paths to get there we think the most likely path is that we retrace betas in a falling rate environment and that would be pretty consistent with what weve seen in prior easening and tightening cycles and so thats the second factor and the third is that we need ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 to manage both expenses and capital well and hopefully you will see that weve actually done that i think very well this year and it would be their commitment to continue doing that and so this kind of links back to the first part of your question which is on credit and so kind of youre new in a role and so what do you do you come in you ask lots of questions and lots of questions on credit you clearly pay attention to the vintages roll rates the collateral values you pay attention to the portfolio level and also a segment level and i think its important averages could be deceiving and so you have to really kind of de average the business in many many ways to really get comfortable whats going on and as we kind of look and we deaverage the base of the business i dont want to kind of get too far to the weeds here but you do need to look at the origination really by quarter and then also really by segment and i think someone earlier asked the question about the performance of vintage relative to expectation and you do see on a likeforlike credit basis that the vintage actually in some cases looks worse than but the mix impacts overwhelm that and so the underwriting changes that were made in were actually seeing that come through in the roll rates were seeing that coming through in the vintages and i think thats going to be bolstered by the collateral values as well and so trust me when im here and we came in we talk about midteens return look ive done my own math ive challenged the math we have here and there is a path here were being less prescriptive about the timing and the reason were being less prescriptive of the timing because a lot can happen with the shape of the yield curve and the forward rates and im no better predicting that than anyone else and then credit normalization we have confidence its going to occur weve probably been a bit optimistic right now and then so were kind of being cautious in terms of being too prescriptive on when thats going to happen when you look at the underlying data when you look at the vintages and when you actually see whats going on in collateral values it gives the confidence there and then hopefully you see that on the expense and capital side were doing whats required in order to be good custodians of this business sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question will come from the line of mark devries with deutsche bank mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks so the geography of where the economics of your ev leasing business falls through the income statement is obviously very different from the other kind of lending and leasing businesses could you just talk about how that impacts your ability to get to the nim russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no its a fair question so maybe just a quick review of the geography so right now we use whats known as the flowthrough method of accounting which weve put in place in the quarter of under the flow through method the geography and the timing of the lease are such that of the ev lease tax credit is such that we basically take the benefit of the tax credit almost all of it upfront on day one and in the tax line and so when you kind of think about the lease contract itself and the overall economics we underwrite that lease to very similar ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 economics that wed underwrite on an internal combustion or ice lease but unlike the internal combustion or ice lease instead of the economics coming through the nim line theyre coming through the tax line and so the nim line in that respect is lower relative to a comparable ice lease the change in accounting that were contemplating would have a switch to whats known as the deferral method under the deferral method the accounting for the ev lease looks a lot more like an ice lease that is we take the benefit of the tax credit over time over the life of the lease through the net interest line and so you get the benefit of basically higher nim as of third quarter it would have added basis points to nim but you dont get the but it comes over time as opposed to coming upfront in the tax line and so wed have a tax rate that looks more normal and youd effectively have the same earnings but over the life of the lease as opposed to kind of taking it all upfront so again that added up to about basis points in the third quarter if our ev leases were treated the same as ice leases or ice leases yeah id say look when we think about our were not looking at it to a level of precision where i think this kind of changes our view on getting there again we feel confident on getting there on the basis of just the overall drivers of our business in terms of looking at our origination yield on auto versus our portfolio yield and looking at the continued rollon of new vintages looking at our outlook for deposit pricing in light of a beta and a lower rate environment and in terms of just thinking of the overall asset mix on our balance sheet moving away from the mortgage and securities and towards more retail auto loans and corporate finance and so yes theyre kind of more big picture drivers that get us to our nim target over time and its not at a level of precision where we can really kind of talk about basis points here or there mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thats helpful and then just looking at your originated yield it still looks pretty strong but can you talk about any impact that recent curtailments may have on your ability to continue to originate at such an accretive yield through your nim russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look i id say look weve continued to be effective at being selective taking advantage of the application volume that weve got to be able to put in place the curtailments and continue to get the yields that were delivering all that being said i would say that we have seen a significant move in two and threeyear swap rates over the course of this year theyre down over basis points since their peak in the spring and that is a factor that we think is going to impact us somewhat on pricing going forward id say we expect that originated yield to come down in the fourth quarter that being said we expect kind of based on our pricing discipline that well continue to price an originated yield that exceeds our portfolio yield and so well continue to see originations that are accretive to our overall yield but just kind of given the rate environment as rates come down well see pressure now i would point out as you think about curtailment and underwriting over the medium term we do have the benefit of at some point starting to unwind some of these curtailments and in effect to capture more yield going forward so we sit here today were north of stier thats our highest credit quality tier as we kind of look and think about the forward as we look at the front book and as we see improving our credit performance well look to start unwinding that i wont put a timeline on that its certainly not something that were doing right away its not ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 something that i would look for in the next couple of quarters but certainly in the go forward you can expect that well get some support from the unwinding of curtailment in terms of our originated yield as well mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it appreciate the comments operator our next question comes from the line of robert wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys bigger picture question on the curtailment do you expect that those decisions will lead to a meaningful reduction in your near prime and below exposure and if so whats the dealer reaction to that because i know youve talked about wanting a lot of application flow from dealers so im curious if the curtailment decisions could have any impact on the flow from dealers and your broader relationship with the dealers as well russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great look so far our relationships with dealers are very good and thats part of the reason why were able to drive the application flow that were getting id say dealers have a lot of respect for the fact that as the business has gone through different cycles and as different players in the auto finance market have ebbed and flowed weve been very consistent and so our ability to show up in size to underwrite a broad spectrum of credits to help them in terms of just making their businesses better in terms of helping them with the used product which is a very important product for them helping them on the fi side through our insurance products and then also providing solutions for them through smartauction and through our passthrough programs which allow us the passthrough programs allow us to speak for an even broader box than what were necessarily willing to underwrite for our balance sheet and so yeah i think all those things together support a very strong relationship with our dealers and so i feel good about how our dealers are thinking about us right now michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and also if you think about if you kind of take a step back and look at our total application volume and the loans that were booking the changes that were making are were seeing the effects on our balance sheet i think from a dealer perspective its going to be a pretty modest adjustment as they kind of look at it because our look tobook ratio gives us the ability to really be pretty thoughtful about which loans were going to book robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks and then just on the competitive intensity youve been benefiting from a softer competitive environment for a little while now there might be some indication that at least certain competitors are reentering are you seeing that and what do you think that could mean for both originated yield and riskadjusted returns going forward ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc maybe you want to take that one michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc okay so weve seen some folks looking to come back in the market you have to look at the segments where the folks who are reentering are playing in a lot of them are in the prime even super prime type space where we get a less of our volume and the other notion is we talked about curtailing here and there but were here through the cycle and being here through the cycle really matters to our dealer customers and so were seeing that benefit as well and then in terms of pricing overall yes pricing will go down as rates go down but look i spend a lot of time looking at riskadjusted margin and clearly taking into account swap rates and then our kind of pro forma view on what credit losses are going to be and we feel good about the business were booking robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you operator our last question will come from the line of jeff adelson with morgan stanley jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions russ i guess just maybe another one on credit apologize i know weve all focused on this so much today but relative to your update last month on the underperformance versus your expectations the basis points in chargeoffs basis points in delinquencies in july and august i was sort of hoping youd be able to help us understand how the performance has migrated since that has the underperformance versus prior expectation sort of stabilized here as you look at september and early october or are there any shifts there and then as it relates to late stage i think youve been quite clear about that i was curious about what maybe youre seeing or noticing more in the early stage side of things as we start to think about here thanks russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great thanks jeff in terms of performance relative to expectations id say its been stable coming out of september and the early october read its been pretty stable and again i think that gives us some degree of confidence as we kind of think about the forward again not kind of giving anyone kind of a specific timing on when we expect credit to crest but at the same time again we continue to see encouraging signs as we look through the vintages and so all that i think feels pretty good sorry what was your second question jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc just an update on what youre seeing in the early stage delinquency side ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2024 russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah the early stage delinquencies have been reasonably stable jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just on the potential accounting changes is that something that youre hearing externally from external parties or is that some represent more proactivity on your part to try to present a smoother earnings path and just try to drive more conservatism in the earnings profile russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look id say its something that weve been discussing for a little while and essentially if you kind of look at the volume of ev leases that weve done we obviously picked up significantly after entering into the agreement with the oem earlier this year you kind of do the comparison between this year and last year last year third quarter it was probably a the ev lease tax credit was probably a singledigit impact on our overall tax rate and so it was there it was something but it wasnt something that we spend a lot of time kind of thinking through in terms of how that impacted the presentation of our overall income statement in terms of nim and tax and just kind of the overall kind of quarterly ebb and flow but obviously with this new oem relationship in place our lease volume has gotten larger and so its impact similarly has gotten larger in terms of when you kind of look at that tax rate in particular and id say this quarter is a case in point in terms of seeing the impact not only from the tax credit in terms of the day one impact when you book the lease but also the tax credit methodology requires us to do these quarterly trueups as we progress through the year and so that kind of introduces another variable and so yeah as you can imagine as we foresaw this kind of getting to be a bigger thing we started having a lot of discussions that quite frankly were initiated by us around just kind of whats the right way to think about the accounting here and whats the right way to present this in terms of kind of presenting our financials in a way that we think kind of best represents our economics and quite honestly were not kind of committing to any level of ev volume or ev lease volume over coming quarters but so far the flow of ev leases has been pretty good and we dont really have any reason to see why it changes over the next few quarters and so looking at all that and taking all that together thats really caused us to initiate a lot of discussions around different accounting treatments now ultimately its a conversation we have obviously internally and also with our auditors kind of any final decision we make has to be blessed by our auditors and so we continue to run the traps on that process over well continue to run the traps in that process over the coming several weeks and we expect to kind of get to an answer in the fourth quarter jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you russ sean leary headinvestor
