year earnings call joining me today are chris niles our cfo and pat ahern our deputy chief credit officer pat is succeeding the current chief credit officer john hankerd wed like to begin by extending our gratitude to john for his years of service at associated and wish him a wellearned retirement after almost years in banking we welcome pat to his responsibilities and know that his years of banking experience including at associated will serve the bank well turning to slide in we faced an interest rate dynamic that was significantly different than the environment for which we had positioned the bank at the end of going into the year our expectation was for two rate increases however as we all know the fed cut rates times and we spent much of the year repositioning the balance sheet for a lower rate environment we reduced our higher cost network transaction deposits from billion at the end of to billion at the end of and we sold billion of loweryielding investment securities aided by the huntington branch transaction we increased our lowcost deposit mix from to at the end of the year since we couldnt control market interest rates we focused on controlling our costs we reduced our absolute noninterest expense by million yearoveryear even while we added net branches from huntington in june we continued to benefit from positive credit trends and our overall credit metrics have remained stable as we further derisked our oil and gas portfolio we remain committed to disciplined underwriting standards we built capital ahead of the cecl implementation that occurred on the first of this year while continuing to deploy capital in accordance with our stated priorities we increased our dividend by and we repurchased million of common stock turning to slide we highlight our loan trends yearoveryear we had solid growth in our commercial and business loan portfolio particularly in general commercial lending and in our power and utilities vertical commercial and business lending balances were up yearoveryear despite shrinking in the fourth quarter this portfolio represents of our total loan book at yearend and our largest single industry exposure remains the manufacturing and wholesale trade sector our commercial real estate portfolio faced significant headwinds in late and early from higher than expected paydown activity however we returned to growth in the second quarter of and are optimistic that this positive trend will continue throughout commercial real estate comprises about a quarter of our total loans and growing the cre balances as a share of total loans is a focus of our management team this year the cre portfolio is welldiversified by geography property type and borrower with about onethird of our cre loans in multifamily properties our exposure to retailers remains very modest and our construction exposure remain near at the end of the year our residential mortgage book was up slightly in represented about of the total loan book at yearend portfolio growth in was negatively impacted by the sale of million in prepaymentsensitive mortgages in the third quarter fourth quarter loan trends are highlighted on slide our commercial and business portfolio had a challenging quarter with declines in general commercial lending reits and the oil and gas book however power and utilities had another strong quarter and with several credits booked late in the quarter we expect continued growth in this vertical in associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 cre continued its rebound with modest growth in the fourth quarter despite seasonal headwinds average balances in the residential mortgage book decreased in the quarter as a result of the previously mentioned sale of mortgages late in the third quarter however we remained wisconsins most active mortgage lender in and grew originations in the fourth quarter giving us positive momentum as we head into turning to slide as shown in the left graph our oil and gas balances decreased by nearly million from the end of q3 to the end of q4 after wrapping up the fall borrowing base redetermination period we benefited from more credit resolutions and payoffs than we previously anticipated looking ahead we expect balances in this portfolio will stabilize as weve neared the completion of the planned derisking in the middle graph power and utility balances have grown by million over the last five quarters we anticipate that trend will continue into our commercial real estate pipeline remains strong as seen in the righthand graph unfunded commitments have increased nearly million to billion since the third quarter of and have risen for four consecutive quarters looking forward we expect to grow our average total loans by to in turning to slide we highlight our annual deposit trends average deposits grew or approximately million from a year ago driven primarily by the huntington branch acquisition weve met our huntington deposit retention goals and expect the same success with first staunton the graphs on the right side of the slide highlight the progress weve made in improving our deposit mix while growing overall deposit balances at the end of our mix of lowcost deposits was up from at the end of while our deposit mix had been trending positively over the last several years the jump in lower cost deposits we saw in is the result of our balance sheet repositioning efforts these efforts also led to the continued reduction of our network transaction deposits yearend balances of these highercost funds fell from and now just represents of our total deposits the remixing of our deposits contributed to the 37basis point reduction in interestbearing deposit costs over the past two quarters of fourth quarter deposit details are on slide fourth quarter average deposits were down billion from the third quarter as our funding needs declined with the sale of loweryielding securities and prepaymentsensitive residential mortgages these asset reductions enabled us to reprice certain highcost deposit categories lower including some of our noncore pricesensitive depositors to withdraw funds net outflows from time deposits and money market accounts totaled million most of these outflows were public funds while interestbearing demand average balances were also down about million this was due to seasonal outflows as municipal customers ph drew on their operating accounts we also continued the reduction of our network deposit balances in the quarter decreasing these highcost deposits by over million while we anticipate these balances may increase in the first quarter of as we experience additional seasonal deposit outflows and we fund anticipated draws on commercial loans we expect the addition of first staunton deposits will mitigate the overall level of noncore deposits and further reduce our cost of funding associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 while our loantodeposit ratio will remain somewhat seasonal we anticipate maintaining this ratio under a funding the majority of our loan growth with core deposits and a lower total cost to deposits given note that rate increases turning to slide our investment portfolio declined to billion as we sold securities and let balances run off to pay down highercost funding we decreased loweryielding taxable securities by approximately million while we increased our tax exempt balance slightly our portfolio yield increased as we retain less shortduration securities and added higheryielding longerduration muni bonds we expect our securities book to trough in the first quarter and anticipate holding the balance at about of total assets turning to slide our full year net interest income was million down million from and our net interest margin was down basis points from the previous year the lower net interest income and margin were caused by several factors first we had million less in acquisition related prepayments and purchased loan accretion in than we did in second our deposits repriced higher in the first part of as they continued to be affected by the rate hike cycle that ended in late its lag effect is typical during rate cycles and often persists for some months after the final rate hike third our commercial loan yields were negatively impacted by fed rate decreases in this effect was exacerbated by libor to fed funds compression as libor rates decreased in anticipation of fed action this led to lower libor based asset yields while the rates on our fed index funding held steady until the actual fed action dates turning to slide we highlight fourth quarter net interest margin trends net interest income was billion down million from the previous quarter as our repositioning efforts resulted in a smaller balance sheet however our net interest margin increased basis points from the third quarter as the decrease in our funding costs outpaced asset yield reductions the net interest margin results were driven by dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet on the asset side average onemonth libor in the fourth quarter decreased basis points from the third quarter negatively impacting commercial loan yields however longterm rates were relatively steady reducing refinancing activity and stabilizing residential mortgage yields our investment portfolio yield increased slightly as loweryielding securities ran off or were sold and we increased the mix of higher yielding municipal bonds on the liability side our balance sheet repositioning strategy resulted in lower funding costs in the fourth quarter total interestbearing deposits and total interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points and basis points respectively looking ahead we expect our deposit cost to continue to decline in the first quarter although at a slower pace than what we saw in the third and fourth quarters of we anticipate our asset yields will stabilize resulting in a full year net interest margin between and assuming a stable interest rate environment turning to slide we highlight annual noninterest income total noninterest income for the year was million up million from the increase from the previous year was driven by higher net mortgage banking income which was up million from gains on investments also contributed to the yearoveryear increase associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 we anticipate the mobile and digital loan application technology investments we made in including solutions for mortgages consumer loans and business loan applications will help facilitate revenue growth in the coming year for we expect total noninterest income to be between million and million excluding investment gains and losses slide we show noninterest expense trends actual noninterest expense was million below our initial guidance for the year of million and million below the prior years level controlling costs has long been a focus here at associated and was no different our noninterest expense was down yearoveryear even with the exclusion of acquisition and restructuringrelated costs which were elevated in the yearoveryear decrease was achieved despite the additional operating expenses of the huntington branches acquired in june of we recently took actions to keep our costs in check for and beyond while we incurred million in restructuringrelated charges in the fourth quarter we anticipate the restructuring will enable us to maintain flat to modestly lower noninterest expenses in including the full absorption of first stauntons costs while we maintain our focus on controlling costs we understand that we need to continue investing in technology that will further improve operational efficiency and enhance our digital presence and capabilities weve increased our technology spending by more than over the past four years and we expect this trend will continue so looking ahead to we expect total noninterest expense to be between million and million including the cost of converting and operating first staunton on slide we summarized the annual credit quality trends of the loan book during the credit environment remained benign and our credit metrics generally improved potential problem loans decreased million from the end of our provision for credit losses was million up from zero in but down from million in as weve previously noted weve already provided for and reserved against the risks we currently see in the oil and gas portfolio we anticipate future oil and gas loan losses are manageable and within our historical patterns of normal provisioning the allowance for loan losses at the end of was down from the third quarter and previous years as part of the implementation of cecl this quarter we expect to incur an after tax equity adjustment of million to million which will reduce our tangible common equity ratio by to basis points as expected on slide we highlight our strong capital position in we maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment we built up capital in preparation for cecl implementation while we adhered to our stated priorities to support organic growth pay a competitive dividend pursue inmarket efficiency driven acquisitions and repurchase shares we increased our dividend in and have grown the dividend by since we deployed capital through the huntington branch acquisition and we returned million to shareholders through common stock repurchases to sum up on slide we state our outlook which reflects our expectations of a stable economy and the closure of the first staunton transaction in february we expect to annual average loan growth and to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 maintain our loantodeposit ratio under we anticipate our full year net interest margin will be between and assuming a stable interest rate environment noninterest income is expected to be between million385 million noninterest expense anticipated to be between million and million including acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the first staunton transaction we expect a effective tax rate between and our loan loss provision is anticipated to adjust with changes in risk grade other indications of credit quality and loan volume and finally we expect to continue to deploy capital through our stated priorities and well continue to operate with at least a tangible common equity ratio with that well open it up to your questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question couple quick ones for you just in terms of the guidance i know its pretty small in the grand scheme of things but does the guidance outside of expenses include or exclude first staunton and i guess specifically where id be most curious is in the margin guidance is there any additional purchase accounting adjustment baked into there or is that kind of a clean margin guide of to philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes its clean margin guide and all the first staunton stuff is included in all the guidance we gave you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then are you able to say with the in the press release you noted some credit valuation adjustments in the fourth quarter are you guys able to detail the size of those christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp its a relatively small number its on our customer derivatives and its just change in the rates and it was million philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp million associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp million r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay so nothing too significant there all right and then final question just i think you also put in the release there was an sequential increase in potential problem loans anything in particular there or is that just kind of normal ebbs and flows philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp no were dealing with such absolute low levels of potential problem loans that yearoveryear theyre down they were up a little bit in the back half of the year but it doesnt seem systemic and were not concerned about it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you guys operator your next question comes from line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good evening philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good evening terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i was hoping you could discuss maybe your thoughts on insurance and mortgage banking in it looks like the insurance dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter so within the context of that million to million if you could just provide some commentary there please philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp the insurance business is inherently a slow growing business we did a number of acquisitions we didnt do any this past year well see what happens in the coming year but the million to million assumes a steady state for the insurance biz and it assumes a lower run rate of mortgage banking income than what we enjoyed in the back half of the year given rate stabilization terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 and then looking at your noninterest expenses i see the million acquisitionrelated costs did i miss some severance severance expenses as well in the fourth quarter is that in the million number christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp it is terry and if you look at page of our press release tables we break out the seven specifically it rounds to million for the quarter its million and change it rounds up to million it was million for the year and million for the fourth quarter rounded terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect okay thanks for pointing that out chris thanks guys christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good afternoon john jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey phil and chris on slide that decline in general commercial you may have touched on a little bit but can you go into detail a little bit more on that what really drove that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp it was kind of across the board i think we feel its pretty anomalous were not really terribly concerned we anticipate pretty robust loan growth this coming year we expect the general commercial lines to grow we certainly expect commercial real estate to grow commercial real estate is sitting on billion of unfunded commitments they had their best year for new production ever in more than billion of new transactions so that billion a significant amount of that will fund up in addition to the new work theyre doing now so the combination of reasonable expectations in commercial banking strong expectations in commercial real estate steady growth in resi mortgage makes us feel pretty confident that were going to hit that to jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 okay good that helps and then the comment you made on the securities portfolio i just do the simple math and i think it suggests maybe it bottoms on around billion in q1 is that the right way to think about it christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah its definitely going to bottom out at roughly of assets during q1 and were basically bouncing around the bottom now and it wont grow other than in proportion to our balance sheet as they move through jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay you guys almost filled out my earnings model but i was just trying to get to an earnings asset number so that helps philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah million is snow plow expense million is snow plow expense indiscernible and its snowing outside right now jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc its been great this winter last one chris i know youve done a lot of thinking about cecl how should we think about the provision for maybe you had a little bit of an increase in the state of reserves but how do you want us to think about your provision christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so in general we think our provision should have less volatility under cecl so it should essentially track growth in the portfolio would be our baseline and we will anticipate again weve got some nice cross anticipations but and the overall nature of the portfolio environment and weve been on a positive or benign credit environment and theres no reason to believe thats going to stop here at december so theres some positive general portfolio trends which will be partially offset by the growth trend we see going forward but generally less volatile provision going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and it shows like most of your cleanup in energy is done as well philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah we feel weve reduced that portfolio substantially another million in the fourth quarter we dont see a whole lot of chargeoffs left and for stuff that were worried on about beyond that the contribution were making to cecl here in this quarter should cover our worries so i feel pretty good about where we are in that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks for the help associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 operator your next question comes from line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey great thanks for the question phil in terms of capital you talked about a flow on the tangible ratio can you speak to inorganic growth opportunities i think in the past you said one or two small deals a year would be possible and i think recently you talked a little bit more openly about the potential merits of an moe just maybe some updated thoughts here philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so our stated goal is to continue to look for efficiencydriven in footprint relatively modest acquisitions and we have discussions going on what ive said about the possibility of an moe is theres a limited number of options and were always open to talking to anyone about what makes sense for our shareholders as well as potentially someone elses so were open to those discussions christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon guys chris actually hit one of my questions but any thoughts on acquiring business lines or portfolios apart from your comments on potential whole bank deals philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure you saw us do the huntington branch transaction which at the end of the day was almost all deposits and buying a portion of what huntington has buying out their wisconsin stuff so were always open to looking at non whole bank deals were particularly interested in looking at opportunities like we had with huntington where we can continue to grow lowcost core deposits those kind of opportunities are few and far between of course but to the extent something came up we would certainly be interested in that as far as looking at loan books and portfolios were open to that but its not as high a priority as continuing to build out the deposit base jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and of course we continue to be interested in asset managementrelated opportunities should they present themselves and philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 and insurance transactions as well yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay then on the cre portfolio can you comment on what youre seeing in terms of payoffpaydown trends and what your expectations are around that as you look going into do you expect that to stay stable or potentially increase or decrease philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so we had a real rush of payoffs back end of leaking into that has abated somewhat and we dont expect any elevated payoff activities so the funding up of a couple billion dollars of commitments that are on our books coupled with new production minus reasonable level of payoffs and theres always plenty of payoffs i mean its the nature of the commercial real estate business that its somewhat of a hamster wheel of making new loans having loans payoff thats how its supposed to work for banks but were going to be net ahead and should be healthily net ahead this year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from line of michael young with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question just wanted to ask about the appetite for residential mortgage on balance sheet production in is that impacted by cecl and do you view that at all as an alternative to securities book growth just kind of to get your high level thoughts there philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so the securities book is going to remain at a lower level than weve historically held as chris said around that range so to the extent the balance sheet expands with loans that will creep up a bit the residential mortgage stuff its a good point clearly cecl causes more credit to be attracted to those loans so were going to be very deliberate about what goes on the balance sheet we have a very active origination sale retain service model here and well continue to look at continuing that model but i think its fair to say that we have some reticence to put loweryielding residential mortgages that attract significantly more capital because of the accounting rules than they used to on the balance sheet michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and just to follow up on the technology and equipment expense can you talk about where kind of new dollars are being put to work maybe how much of that is kind of customer experiencedriven versus efficiency efforts et cetera associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure it turns out that usually improving the digital customer experience also leads to more efficiency so were now up to about of our mortgage applications are rolling through our blend application that we rolled out earlier this year that causes significant efficiency with the digitization of that application from the moment that someone starts typing on their computer or their phone or their tablet most of our efforts are customerfacing so that we remain relevant and more than competitive with many of our competitors in our footprint and thatll continue but we also have other significant technology projects that weve completed we recently completed a complete revamping of our marketing campaign management system which automates a lot of our ability to digitally connect with customers and send out hundreds and thousands or millions of emails in an efficient manner so thats both a customerfacing technology but clearly drives efficiency and accuracy in the back shop so id say its both but its more heavily weighted toward the customer experience michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks operator your next question is a followup from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thank you i was just curious on the overall credit portfolio i guess if were sort of nearing the end of energyrelated chargeoffs as you finished derisking that portfolio where are your nonenergy chargeoffs running these days maybe in terms of basis points would be great i know theyre very small but im just trying to get a sense for what the expectation for total chargeoffs would be if were kind of sunsetting on the issues in the energy portfolio philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i mean thats always hard to prognosticate because any one chargeoff can drive that in this past quarter we had million of net chargeoffs a little less than million were oil and gas related most of the rest of it was some mortgage and other consumer assets so the vast bulk of our chargeoffs this past year were oil and gas and the remainder was next to nothing i dont have the basis points in front of me but its probably a single digit r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay all right perfect thank you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session and i would like to turn the call back to philip flynn for closing remarks philip b flynn president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well thanks everybody for joining us today we feel wellpositioned going into the efforts we made to reposition our balance sheet for the rate environment were in we believe will pay dividends were in we believe will pay dividends we should have a stable net interest margin potentially rising a little bit you saw the results in the fourth quarter of our nim actually going up basis points we feel good about our loan growth we will manage expenses as we always do and we believe were in a benign credit environment so i think were wellpositioned to perform well in we look forward to welcoming our first staunton customers and colleagues in february and we look forward to talking to all of you in april and as always if you have any questions give us a call and thanks again for your interest in
