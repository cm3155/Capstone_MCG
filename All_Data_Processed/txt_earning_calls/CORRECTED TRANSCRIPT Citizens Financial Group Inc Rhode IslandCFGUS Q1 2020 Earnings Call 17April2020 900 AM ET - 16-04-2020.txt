colleagues who must report to work and have provided them with citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 additional compensation and we have made million in grants to small businesses and nonprofit partners to help our communities through these difficult times in short we are doing what a responsible corporate citizen should be doing our financial performance in q1 was heading towards an excellent quarter prior to the disruption caused by covid19 in march nonetheless we had a very good revenue and ppnr results faced by record mortgage revenue strong loan growth and expanding nim if you indiscernible chargeoffs as our credit costs in q1 we would have had a quarter but of course the new cecl accounting standard requires a recalibration of lifetime losses on the loan portfolio given the significantly changed macro environment this led to a million provision representing a million or reserve build over chargeoffs as such our underlying eps was in the quarter we have of notable items to our top program and franklin integration costs so reported eps was now this is more frontloaded than many analysts have modeled weve assumed a deep recession in q2 followed by a vshaped recovery in our forecasts which is true would take us back to more normal provision levels over the balance of if the recovery is more ushaped provisions will be higher safe to say theres a great deal of uncertainty over the economic outlook we feel good that we have a strong balance sheet position with cet1 at our ldr at and a strong lcr with enormous contingent liquidity our tangible book value per share held steady at and we are confident it will sustain a strong level of ppnr over the balance of audio gap decision to suspend share repurchases for the balance of should maintain a strong cet1 ratio through varying economic scenarios including a ushaped recovery we have provided significant granular information on our credit portfolios in our investor deck we believe we have maintained a highly prudent credit risk discipline and as a reminder our dfast credit losses have consistently been better than the peer average we have continued to make progress on all the strategic initiatives that we had teed up for our colleagues have done a fantastic job of dealing with the covid19related crisis while also making sure we are hitting our key bau deliverables current environment presents new risks and opportunities we are looking for ways to incorporate these into our strategy with an eye towards coming out of a crisis stronger than our peers we are not cutting back on investments designed to drive future customer acquisition and revenue growth allinall a challenging time we are handling things well i hope you and your families are healthy and safe with that let me offer a welcome to brendan as our new head of consumer and now ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone on page lets start with a brief overview of our headlines as we navigate this unprecedented environment we entered this crisis from a position of balance sheet strength for example after the stress experienced in march we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of even after increasing our balance for credit losses billion and funding approximately billion of line draws our acl for loans ratio of compares well to stress loss scenarios as well as to peers and our tangible book value per share at quarter end is nearly per share which is stable versus fourth quarter our liquidity ratios were stable with an ldr of approximately and we remain in compliance with the lcr earnings at the ppnr level proved to be resilient as weve generated record revenues in fee income while absorbing significant negative covid19 impacts in multiple fee categories as a result we have been committed citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 to investing in our strategic initiatives including the top transformation program and our portfolio of strategic revenue initiatives moving to page ill cover some of the ways we are supporting our customers many of our customers have been directly impacted by the pandemic and we have been swiftly moving to assist them during this difficult time while still taking appropriate steps to mitigate risks so far weve delayed payments on loans were about retail customers and about small businesses a number of our commercial clients have taken the defensive position as they prepare to weather the storm through april we funded about billion in commercial line draws after the initial rush to draw down on loans in march weve seen the pace of line draws slow considerably finally we have been literally working day and night to facilitate the fca payroll protection program for smaller companies with less than employees as of april we have received applications from over companies and have approximately billion in loans registered with the sba lets move to page and cover cecl we increased our allowance for credit losses by approximately million to billion at march from approximately billion at yearend this was created in two steps the first was the previously communicated day one impact of million effective january the second was the reserve build of million recorded as part of the first quarter provision of million which also included million of chargeoffs at quarter end the acl to loans ratio was retail portfolio had an allowance to loans ratio of based on longer duration or unsecured loans while commercial portfolios had an allowance to loans ratio of we have also summarized the key aspects of our macroeconomic scenario which is a foundational element of the cecl reserve estimate at quarter end we elected to use the march moodys baseline which integrates covid19 effects as our base scenario given the uncertainty of the continued economic outlook we also included an alternate moodys pandemic scenario and an internally generated scenario further we incorporated the indiscernible factor to fully account for the benefit of our expected customer assistance efforts and the impact of the various government support programs on our portfolio in general our economic scenario assumes a steep drop in gdp in followed by a vshaped recovery in the second half of the year if this scenario plays out provision requirements over the balance of will factor the ph impact for loan growth if the pandemic impacts are deeper or it takes longer for the economy to recover then we are looking at a u or lshaped recovery or if government programs are less effective we could require meaningful addition to provision now let me move to the highlights of our underlying results covered on slides and despite the backdrop of covid19 pandemic and ceclrelated reserve build our results highlight our operational discipline and the benefit of our diversified business model we have record revenues and fee income an improved net interest margin and strong liquidity and funding metrics for the quarter we reported eps of which was down yearoveryear and down linked quarter driven by the impact of covid19 reserve build of million indiscernible million was up yearoveryear and down only slightly linked quarter despite covid19 headwinds and the impact of seasonality we saw strong balance sheet growth including average loan growth with indiscernible of which benefited nii and help offset the impacts of the more challenging rate environment and record fees were driven by record results in mortgage banking and wealth we also saw strong underlying performance in capital markets and fx and irp before covid19 impacts citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 on page net interest income increased linked quarter as the benefit of interestearning asset growth and improved mix was partially offset by the impact of the more challenging rate environment and day count net interest margin increased basis points liked quarter as loan yield benefited from widening liborois spreads as well as mix our proactive pricing actions produced an basis points decline in deposit costs which helped mitigate yield curve headwinds as one month libor dropped basis points moving to fees on slide noninterest income was up yearoveryear with relatively stable levels on a linked quarter basis record results in mortgage banking and trust and investment service fees were partially offset by the impact of covid19 that included a total of million of fair value markdowns on loan trading and customer derivative assets in the linked quarter as well as the impact of a shutdown and other categories on a sequential basis mortgage banking fees achieved another record by doubling to million which reflected strong refi lock volumes and improved gain on sale margins while management posted another solid performance with trust and investment services fees up sequentially the strong managed money sales offset the impact of market declines capital markets fees of million decreased million from record fourth quarter levels driven by million of marks on loan trading assets foreign exchange and interest rate product revenue decreased million from record fourth quarter levels including a million reduction from a net cva adjustment given the falling rates and lower activity caused by reduced variable term lending volume turning to page noninterest expense increased million or linked quarter margins reflecting seasonality and higher revenuebased compensation salaries and employee benefits were up given the fica tax and 401k match seasonal impacts along with higher compensation tied to strong mortgage originations in the quarter yearoveryear our noninterest expense was up largely reflecting the impact of growth oriented investments annual merit and revenuebased compensation which was partially offset by efficiencies generated from our top programs lets now discuss the loan trends on page average core loans were up linked quarter and up before the impact of one sales activity tied to our balance sheet optimization initiatives during the quarter we sold an additional million in nonrelationship mortgages which coupled with fourth quarter activity reduced average loans ph by almost billion on a linked quarter basis core commercial loans were up driven by the impact of higher line draws and strength in cre core retail loans were up linked quarter and up before the impact of the loan sales activity given growth in education and merchant financing partnerships on a linked quarter basis periodend loan growth was driven by increase in commercial given higher line of credit utilization and relatively stable retail loans moving to page we saw nice average deposit growth of linked quarter and yearoveryear as we benefited from investments we made over the past several years to expand and enhance our capabilities on a periodend basis deposits were up keeping pace with loan growth we continue to manage down our deposit costs across all channels reducing cd rates retail money market ph promo rate and taking down the savings rate in our digital bank and managing commercial deposits aggressively as a result our interest bearing deposit costs were down basis points citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 next lets move to page and cover credit we continue to assess the impact of the covid19 pandemic and instituted a variety of measures to identify and monitor various potential risks nonperforming loans increased linkedquarter driven by a million increase in commercial largely tied to its new ph noncorerelated loans and modestly higher retail the npl ratio of basis points increased basis points linked quarter and improved basis points yearoveryear net chargeoffs came in at basis points for the quarter up modestly linkedquarter reflecting an increase in commercial partially offset by a decrease in retail the allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans ratio ended the quarter at compared with in the first quarter of up from in the fourth quarter of turning to page we have been highly disciplined on credit with prudent risk appetite in consumer we remain focused on super prime and prime borrowers the weighted fico score across our portfolio is at and approximately of the retail portfolio has a refreshed fico of or better overall our commercial portfolio is highly granular and diversified in terms of geography industry and asset class roughly of the portfolio is investment grade on a bond equivalent ratings basis and the risk ratings improved yearoveryear and we remain underweight to peers in commercial real estate we have been very disciplined around client selection and indiscernible developers that weve seen perform well and responsibly in prior cycles and on slide its also important to note that our companyrun dfast gearing adverse scenario results performed in line or better than the peer average which we believe indicates that we are relatively wellpositioned to managing the current crisis on page we highlight the granular and diversified nature of our commercial portfolio along with the areas in commercial that have been most immediately impacted by the covid19 shutdown and low energy prices we have run a deep dive across the majority of the commercial portfolio to identify cash flow and liquidity vulnerabilities with an eye towards helping our customers through these challenging times while taking additional steps to more tightly manage risk together these sectors account for approximately of the total cfg loans overall we think that the percentage of our portfolio concentrations to these areas of perceived risk are largely at or below indiscernible we highlighted on the slide some of the factors that we consider to be risk mitigants to these portfolios and we have individual tear sheets in the appendix on each industry that provides more detail on the factors we are monitoring moving to slide on retail credit our fresh fico scores on the consumer side of the house are around and of the portfolio is collateralized so for some of the areas of potential concern i will just highlight briefly in education we got again very high ficos and the inschool book is cosigns in the education refinance portfolio borrowers have been in the workforce for six years on average and of them have advanced degrees and about a third of the portfolio has been cosigned the consumer unsecured book includes billion of shortduration merchant partnership loans largely driven by the apple platform as well as loans indiscernible adt and microsoft and a firm for peloton its important to note that the vast majority of this portfolio is subject to losssharing arrangement and the remaining billion is our unsecured installment portfolio which has very high fico scores of on average as with commercial weve included more details on these consumer portfolios in the appendix citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 on page as previously mentioned we feel wellpositioned to manage through the current environment with strong capital and liquidity positions strong deposit growth kept pace with elevated loan growth leaving our liquidity metrics steady we have a diversified funding profile with very strong indiscernible core deposit and substantial capacity to do more for our clients as they manage through the crisis in march we announced that we would cease share repurchases and with the extent of the pandemic disruption becoming clearer we have decided to extend that through the end of the year to ensure that capital levels are strong to meet loan demand we expect to remain wellcapitalized and intend to maintain the dividend at the current level on page i want indiscernible a few exciting things that are happening across the company while we are first and foremost focusing on helping our clients we have not stopped working to help build a better company we are driving forward on our strategic initiatives so that we emerge wellpositioned for the future we are continuing to execute on the transformational top program and we are also moving forward with our major strategic revenue initiatives while considering new opportunities arising from the current environment in an effort to drive higher revenue growth coming out of the crisis moving to page given the impact of the pandemic its challenging to predict an outlook for the future and we no longer affirm our fullyear guidance nonetheless we do however want to offer some higher level commentary on key categories for full year with a reminder that we currently expect to see more of a v shaped recovery start to play out in the back half of the year we believe we can deliver modest growth in net interest income which includes the benefit of the ppp program we expect that strong loan growth will more than offset a meaningful decrease in nim due to rates and noninterest income is now expected to be broadly stable as strength in mortgage is offset by covid19 driven weaknesses in other categories the outlook of these will depend upon the pace and magnitude of recovery in the second half of noninterest expense is expected to be up modestly given higher compensation tied to stronger mortgage production and impacts from covid19 which includes government lending programs and customer relief efforts provision expense has the greatest potential for variability in and will depend on the depth of the recession and the pace of recovery we expect to see strong loan growth driven by higher line draws in commercial the impact of government programs like ppp as well as the increased demand in education and merchant financing at the same time we anticipate a strong increase in commercial and retail deposits reflecting heightened liquidity given fed actions and a lowrate environment our regulatory capital ratios are expected to strengthen from current levels under the vrecovery scenario as net income coupled with the suspension of buybacks to yearend more than offset the impact of higher rwas even in more severe economic scenarios we expect our capital ratios to remain strong and above required minimums now lets move to page for some highlevel commentary on the second quarter we expect nii to be up low to midsingledigits as strong loan growth more than offsets the sizeable decrease in nim fee income is expected to be down in the low to midsingledigit range reflecting covid19 impact from service charges card and other fees noninterest expense is expected to be up slightly given the covid19 impact mentioned earlier but netnet we would expect positive operating leverage in the quarter but this expense will depend on the depth of recession and pace of recovery citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 finally we expect significant loan growth reflecting line draw from commercial the impact of government programs and increased demand in education our capital liquidity and funding positions are expected to remain strong to sum up on page we are focused on delivering well for our stakeholders in these challenging times we have strong balance sheet and leadership team and indiscernible that give us confidence that well rise to the occasion now let me turn it back to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john and operator lets open it up to qa please question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun operator instructions our first question will come from line of erika najarian go ahead please erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you so much for all the detail that you provided im wondering as we think about a potential u or wshape recovery how does the economic parameters are playing out during this pandemic compared to the dfast scenario that imply a cumulative loss rate of over nine quarters john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so ill go ahead and start off on that erika i think the way that we look at this just big picture is how when you look at our reserve to loan ratio of billion that we have and that that really positions us well when you go back and look at the cycle which is the last time we went through the debt process and it also positions us well for the cycle based upon our internal estimates of how much coverage were creating citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 so to cover a few numbers on that front if you go back to the fed scenarios and look at the adverse scenario and theres been a fair amount of analysis that illustrates that the rate environment and other aspects of the adverse are pretty similar to what were going through today and our billion would represent of coverage on those losses in the adverse scenario in terms of our internal estimates the fed numbers would be around we think well do better than the fed weve had remapping issues that have gone in our favor and weve consistently estimated losses that would be lower than the fed models would indicate but even as we look at the fed models we have coverage of the adverse scenario from back then you fast forward to even if there was a severely adverse scenario similar to what the fed scenario would indicate in our coverage would be around we believe theres maybe better than maybe some peers given the comments made earlier about where we think our loss ratios are going to come out so we think that positions us very well and maybe ill stop there and see if thats responsive erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my followup question is im wondering if you can help quantify the magnitude of net interest margin decline in the second quarter and of that magnitude how much would be attributed to the payment protection program and if we assume that those loans pay off by third quarter does that mean that nim could be at a higher starting point in third quarter versus john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill take your question so the way i would look through it is we start off with the rate environment itself and given the liborois spread widening out in the first quarter we really havent felt all of the impact of the rate cuts from and theres an expectation that thatll narrow in in the second quarter and so libor and rates in general indiscernible expectations will be down call it basis points or so across the curve both in the short end and in the long end in the past weve indicated that for every basis points you would see about million of nii impact with respect to nim and so that will help you triangulate and for that million is typically in the neighborhood of ph basis points so if you triangulate all of that that will give you a sense for maybe lowteens impact to the rates the other aspects we have to look at in q2 is mix as you mentioned how large will the ppp program be that isnt dilutive what is our mix in the rest of the loan portfolio were seeing indiscernible demand underlying the that the ppp and other lines are out so that still happen in our education portfolios and merchant finance that we indicated earlier that actually provides a benefit but when you look at all of those things we still think that there will be a meaningful and significant decline in net interest margin given rates in the second quarter the third your question about third quarter based on how were planning to account for ppp which at the moment looks like will all flow through the nii line and if you think about the forgiveness cycle if were going to amortize the fees that we expect to earn on the ppp program over the contractual life of the loans up through the forgiveness date so if you expect maybe to weeks after funding that there could be some forgiveness and majority of loans being forgiven given that this is intended to be a grant program you would see all that come into nii in the third quarter all driving net interest margin then that would reset net interest margin higher in the third quarter citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would just add erika also that you commented on nim but lose sight of the fact that were calling nii to be up in q2 because of volume the volume effect should offset the nim contraction erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you for taking my questions john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from the line of ken zerbe one moment please your line is open go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks i really appreciate the guidance that you gave on slide about cecl i think it helps out tremendously the question i have just your first bullet there you talked about youre using moodys baseline but youre also saying youre using your own internal assumptions can you just talk a little bit more about your own internal assumptions are they more severe or less severe than moodys and how much weight did you put on your own assumptions versus the moodys assumptions thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah a couple of thoughts on that so i think our baseline scenario that has thats overweight is the moodys the internal scenario i would say is maybe equal to slightly more punitive than that scenario we have another moodys scenario at the time that we were closing our books i think the was based on whats really one of the most punitive moodys scenarios that ever out was out there so we had another levels of was slightly less significant than that coming but still pandemicdriven so we use ph in general but the majority is really focused on this moodys baseline the other scenario indiscernible variety of other lenders associated with it we have this down with gdp and the on unemployment but as an example our internal scenario would have gotten unemployment up to so just to give you a sense for how we indiscernible theres a significant amount of uncertainty which is why were using multiple scenarios and we think that helps you inform the ultimate outcome ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it perfect citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would add ken too that we were trying to be as conservative as we could i think by taking that very late forecast into account weve certainly been watching where the moodys scenario model moves and id say its moved a little more conservatively its hard to say what exactly what kind of translates into impact on our reserving with this point i think we just have to see more data play out before we could look at that so if the recession is either deeper which currently looks like that could be the case and then with recovery ends up extending a little bit which im not sure necessarily is the case we just have to see theres certainly a big groundswell for starting to reopen the economy given the pain that everybody is suffering so well just have to watch those two factors and then go back and update things as we get to the end of the second quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then just one other question on the same slide you mentioned that if there is a ushape recovery for example you could have indiscernible provisions i understand the concept but i guess my question really is like it seems that your the assumptions youve made went from lets say good period right to even before the pandemic to something really bad including the deep recession can you just help us understand if there is a ushape recovery and it takes another quarter for things to get better why does provision why would provision be meaningfully higher than next step may not be higher than first quarter but why would it be as fairly large given the vast majority of your assumptions that youve already made sort of the vast majority of the negative revision so to speak if that make sense to your economic models john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe ill answer this way ken i think one thing that we as bruce mentioned we did look and notice that since march moodys has updated i think it was on april it was earlier this week april earlier this week and were seeing some eyepopping gdp numbers that come out instead of its et cetera i think the depth is one thing but the length of the downturn in terms of whether its u is another at a very big picture i think one way to think about this if something like that were to occur i would basically i think were positioned in a way that our capital ratios which were around at the end of the quarter would remain broadly stable to up slightly even if we were to directionally assume another scenario that would have well certain aspect the aspects of moodys update that would have taken gdp down to and i think that thats what this is about is articulating capital strength and our allowance alone coverage would of course increase it would get to something with a two handle on it as opposed to ph but nevertheless our capital ratios would be broadly stable to up potentially even up slightly under one of those scenarios bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add to your specific question as to why ken id say if it takes longer to get back to an operating economy clearly theres more stress on companies that can open and start collecting revenues and serving customers and then clearly individuals dont get back to work as quickly so theres more stress on individuals so you would just have to do the recalibration on that and see where that puts you so i think its possible citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 i think we put a good number on the board here in the first quarter and well have to wait and see how much adjustment wed have to make based on further input but in any case i think john did underscore the big point which is our capital ratio was strong and can absorb that and so we feel good that we can both meet the loan demand coming in from our customers put away what we need to if we need more reserves and still maintain a very strong capital position ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much operator your next question will come from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc all right thanks good morning maybe starting with fee income i was hoping you could expand a bit on your second quarter outlook i know you mentioned service charges in cards but any insight and thoughts into say mortgage and capital markets john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start off i think that weve seen another record quarter in mortgage and record in wealth on the capital markets front frankly before the loan trading mark that we took which had an impact of million in the quarter we were having an exceptional quarter on top of exceptional quarter in so mortgage outlook were still quite strong we had an excellent quarter in i think our early expectations are that well have a similar performance in i mean its early days and things can move quickly but from what weve seen in april although maybe lock volumes may not be quite as strong as they were in the first quarter our margins have really frankly increased to levels that weve never seen before given all of the operational capacity issues across the industry and weve been a source of financial strength and execution certainty and that has driven our margins up in mortgage bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and allows us to gain market share as well john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island absolutely and were taking share across all our channels which is really excellent to see its positioned us extremely well and in the wealth space weve been able to have frankly managed money sales really nice uptake there thats been offsetting our market declines and so weve had good momentum on that front and then in capital markets its really marketdependent so those are indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island why dont we let brendan offer any further perspective on consumer and then don you can offer a comment on commercial citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well said thanks john on mortgage the nonbanks are having some challenges as well so were indiscernible supporting your comments around margins widening out we expect that to broadly continue our pipeline is extremely full were growing our los mildly through q1 and into q2 so we expect mortgage to continue to be extremely strong through the quarter on the service charge line our debit transactional volume was down at the end of march to thats driving the pullback in q2 both on debit fees but also less transactions leads to less overdraft occurrences so we do expect that to recover towards the back half of q2 broadly aligned with our guidance and vshaped recovery through q3 and q4 but thats putting some strain on q2 for service charges and so i think john covered the wealth story really well so i wont add anything to that donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island on capital markets i think in general deal activity will be below because of the uncertainty in the environment but there are a couple of encouraging signs were beginning to see there was huge inflows into the highyield funds over the last couple of days were actually seeing more highyield issuance as companies try to garner more liquidity and buffer their liquidity position so were benefiting a little bit from that now and youll remember that we also bought another boutique ma firm this quarter and they happen to be very focused on restaurant restructuring businesses so were beginning to see some opportunistic flow there and ill also mention that were actually seeing some quite strong activity in our irp businesses right now as these companies actually are garnering liquidity by restructuring existing slots and putting some slots on the books to take advantage of the current positioning and on the market john talked about weve actually seen about ph of that reverse already as weve seen rallies in both the leverage loan market and the high yield market so some of thats come back to us already so were a little cautious but were seeing a few signs of life out there bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good thank you terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then indiscernible operator well go next to the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so theres been some ongoing concerns in the market that you take more credit risk and i think some of the details that you provide today should alleviate those concerns but here we are entering a credit cycle and i think this is a chance to show that your credit is not worse than others obviously your estimates internally are better than peers but as we think out over the next several quarters couple of years what are the metrics that we should be looking at to evaluate your credit performance versus others and it sounds like an obvious question but obviously theres all these payment deferrals going on so it may not be as straightforward as kind of look at the traditional trends but wondering how you would think about and frame that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes let me start and then john you could pick up but its almost i remember when we did have that perception out there that we had grown fast and it wont end well and so we all had people inside the shop say gee just wait ph until we get into recession and then we can prove it really almost wished for a recession i said be careful what you wish for because id be happy to indiscernible many many quarters and years without experiencing recession but here we are so i think we feel really really good first off on the consumer side of the house that each of those portfolios that we have weve stayed with a very conservative risk appetite super prime high prime weve moved into spaces where we think we can get good riskadjusted returns even with that conservative risk profile and so you saw us grow explore and pioneer the growth of the education refinance market which we think is one such place and then also on our merchant financing unsecured business where we have losssharing arrangements with very strong credit counterparties that also i think gives us a very good riskadjusted rate of return in those portfolios and so some of the fed modeling doesnt pick that up and we obviously have the ability to understand that and pick that up so i do think well end up performing well on the consumer side better than expectations and i think better than peers and so that would be kind of the bedrock that you should be watching that and i think hopefully youll see us deliver on that and then similarly on commercial we have as weve grown the book weve actually grown faster with bigger companies bigger customers in the midcorporate space and those customers tend to be more highly rated than the middle market companies and so there again that should benefit us when we go through this period and i think weve also been very disciplined in terms of the industries that were banking trying to be say well diversified trying to make sure our whole positions are granular and so i think that should also provide a benefit in the areas of commercial real estate or sponsors weve also kept the list of counterparties that we want to deal with quite tight folks that we know and have done business with for a long time we think theyre good operators we think they treat their banks well so i think that should also work in our favor and then i guess youd look at the same things youd be looking at the chargeoff rate in those portfolios over time so anyway i think we will nows the proving time so we feel good about how weve maintained our discipline and how weve done bso and repositioned ourselves to make higher net interest margin and better returns while keeping an incredible discipline on the risk part of the equation citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and maybe just to add to that bruce i mean i think you asked about metrics i mean i guess id break it down the chargeoffs have always been lagging they may be even more lagging in this cycle than in the past given all the forbearance activities that were going to be engaging in but nevertheless we will be monitoring them as you think about the current positioning where i think we keep an eye on reserves to total loans which we indicated was today i would also maybe just highlight the diversification across the balance sheet and keep an eye on that we are right around in terms of commercialretail and when you dig into each one of those books whether its in the commercial side areas of interest or concern theyre all in the low very low percentages of the overall book and geographically diversified as well and then on the retail consumer side of things yeah in mostly collateral lines in areas that we understand and have been in businesses for a very long time and where we are not collateralized its distributed across several different asset classes not all the ph kind we were in student we were in card we were in merchant finance and theres a personal and ph skilled product so we think that is the name of the game there so those are the current metrics forwardlooking metrics really comes down to stress results which we ph geared better than media in the past and our internal modeling which we have thought have been increasing levels of sophistication over time and weve been back testing and trying to keep current so i think those are the three areas youd want to monitor when youre thinking about things through the cycle matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and can you just thats all helpful color can you just remind us this slide where you talk about your internal stress test showing loss rates going down bps versus last year can you remind us what drove that was that some derisking or model changes or just remind us what drove that big drop thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think there was a couple of things i mean i think that over time weve been doing a better job of indiscernible our risk ratings to we basically had frankly underappreciated the strength of the risk ratings across the portfolio and say that was the driver of the improvement secondly the full effect of loss sharing arrangements in our merchant finance portfolio that have been fully built in and then third just over time the noncore portfolio has been dropping which had some higher loss content its gotten down to a very small level so those are the things that come to mind for me in terms of what the drivers were bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes and i think also the cumulative benefit of bso is also being picked up as well matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator our next question will be from brian foran with autonomous go ahead please citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 ellen a taylor a head of investor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island brian operator mr foran your line is open mr foran weve lost your line if you would hit then again we can try to open it once more ellen a taylor a head of investor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island take the next call take the next question please operator mr foran your line is open brian d foran q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah can you hear me bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah brian d foran q analyst autonomous research us lp okay sorry about that going back to the stress test i wonder if you could just speak a little more to the impact of fed support and broader government stimulus and im sure its hard to put a number on it but i guess the thing thats striking to me is if i look at unemployment and gdp clearly were probably going to be worse at least for a little while but on the other side the stock market is at bbb credit yields are at whereas theyre like today so when we think about the balance between the macro versus asset prices clearly the macro is probably the biggest input but how much of a buffer or shock absorber do those better asset prices give in your mind john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah im not sure i fully appreciate it so youre asking bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well i think that the thrust of the question is the fed is obviously stepped up here as i understand it and thats made a big difference in the markets certainly the pricing of assets has come in which is a signal that credit quality is better or potentially companies will experience less stress at least from ph problems as long as the fed is playing the way theyre playing and so how much weight do we place on that when we kind of do our modeling and look at the reserving that were doing is that the question really is that the thrust of the question citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 brian d foran q analyst autonomous research us lp that was yes thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say theres a couple of things it has a meaningful impact i mean i think thats one of the big items that distinguish this current stress environment from possibly the modeled environments you would see coming out of the fed right so when you go back to the ph cycle and you see the results there they dont have this massive stimulus that we have given reasonable weight to in our outlooks and so that is embedded and its not just the government actions which are significant on the fiscal front and the monetary front its also our internal actions that are idiosyncratic and all the little things that were doing to get ahead of this that are very hard to model in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island like forbearance john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly i have a forbearance that were doing all the modifications that were doing how aggressive well be in there and our insights and instincts around where to target those efforts weve built that in in our modeling bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island along with the overall support from the government thats a meaningful impact and the other thing to keep in mind and i should add this the other important distinction when we look back at severely adverse scenarios is that all of those scenarios are all ushaped you heard from bruce earlier u shapes are very stressful vshapes are less so and so even if gdp in prior severely adverse scenarios dont fall by as much as were all saying there that it could fall today the fact that it stays well for such a long period of time is what creates all that stress in the prior severely adverse scenarios so when you fast forward to where we are today what were assuming what we have in our numbers is more of a stronger recovery in thats more v shaped and we also have the support the significant support of the stimulus and our internal actions bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 yeah i do think though its safe to say weve never seen i mean the fed has pulled out all their tools from their toolkit from the last goround and then theyve added more and the fiscal stimulus bill was ginormous and very expensive and fat in terms of trying to get the cash out to help companies and to help individuals and so we really dont have much to go by in terms of modeling all of that the kind of easing off of tdr treatment on forbearance to encourage that thats another delta that hasnt been in prior models so theres just a lot of uncertainty overall with this modeling and i think all banks are doing the best they can both with the scenario and then kind of some of the offsets from federal government actions from the fed kind of reserve actions and then from the internal actions which is why i think well just need more time to clarify kind what is that true picture as we go through the second quarter brian d foran q analyst autonomous research us lp if i could sneak in one more if i just think about your ability to maintain dollars of cet1 capital over the next year like total loss absorption capacity i guess youve got million a quarter maybe million of ppnr i mean it seems like you would have some securities gains you can harvest if you needed to which would pull it into cet1 capital and then youve got some relief on the cecl accounting i mean it kind of seems like when you add it all up the loss absorption so to speak over the next four quarters maybe is like billion or something is that kind of a fair way to think about it john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so ill go and start bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would probably just say its ample that we are very focused on continuing to deliver strong levels of ppnr i think thats one of the first lines of defense and we see i think notwithstanding all of the change in the environment our ppnr level was still up versus a year ago on the first quarter and it was close to flat on a sequential quarter basis and we think theres a good ability to sustain that over the balance of the year so you basically start with that we have obviously some bso actions that we could take if we needed to to kind of release some rwas and also create some additional capacity and then i think on the capital line we think our dividend is secure but weve curtailed buybacks for the rest of the year so if you put that all together id say were very confident in our outlook that if the situation worsens we have very strong capital position and levers to pull and ability to continue to ph post good number of  john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and just to add to that i mean i think bruce mentioned stability in ppnr thats one of the first lines of defense and our diversified increasingly diversified business model across nii and across fees is really helping on that front our transformation programs are helping on that front i would also mention that i think you mentioned securities just based upon where rates are we exclude given weve excluded aoci from our capital ratios but if you were to take a look at that thats in its almost billion of marks that are unrealized and so thats part of the balance sheet strength that you would want to look at in the event that youre trying to figure out that part of the story as well citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 i mean all in rwa is expected to rise during the year and if our scenarios hold we expect that our cet1 ratios are going to be stable to rising throughout the year so you put all that together and i think thats hopefully responsive to triangulate where youre trying to get to in terms of where dollars of capital strength will be bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you next question operator we will next go to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bruce good morning john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc first the transparency of your slide deck is one of the best so thank you for doing that its very helpful for all of us and on slide youve given us some good detail on the forbearance and then i know this is quite a bit difficult question to answer but two parts what percentage of your portfolio do you think will actually ask for forbearance both in the commercial and the retail and then second how are you guys going to monitor loans that go into forbearance and actually are going to be chargeoffs or theyre going to be nonaccruals but initially theyre going into forbearance because everybody is permitted to do that can you share with us some of the guardrails that you might have to develop to make sure that youre not again not doing it on purpose but there is an extend and pretend limitation here donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island so gerard its don on the commercial side weve actually done an extremely detailed liquidity cash burn analysis across the portfolio and bucketed our clients into three buckets one a bucket that we some kind of restructuring and ph call it we dont really call it forbearance in the commercial bank with some kind of payment relief or restructuring of the payments and thats a very small portion of the portfolio like less than then theres another maybe call it where we think two or three quarters out theyre going to need covenant restructuring and maybe some relief from covenants depending how the recovery materializes and then the vast majority of the portfolio we think looks just fine from a cashoncash standpoint so were really looking at everything cashoncash at this point and itll be developing but were very comfortable that its a relatively limited number of people in our portfolio that are going to need really payment relief citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ph hi gerard yeah on the consumer side weve got above of our portfolios in forbearance status at the moment the majority of those are threemonth forbearance programs whats interesting is were seeing a meaningful amount of our forbearance to customers that are actually cash flowing and still making their payments and so we believe a large percentage of our customer base is doing this as a safety net and not yet under duress yet so were working hard on analytics to subsegment our forbearance portfolio to identify further treatments as they come off the days if there are some that have significant stress and cant make their payment weve got another lever for another days prior to having them all through chargeoff and for those that waited through the quarter successfully theyll come back into full principal and interest payments so weve got a variety of collection tactics and support tactics for our customers to help them make the right choices a variety of other levers in our collection shop should alternative programs make more sense than a forbearance as well so yeah well see how the next few months goes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thank you gerard next question operator that will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies go ahead please ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning i just want to ask a little bit about on the line draws you guys mentioned in one of the earlier slides obviously how they had slowed through april and that the usage has been in the industrys most affected i wanted to ask you about you mentioned that about of the draws are converted to deposits and what do we take away from that meaning is it that the other might be being used or is it that those just arent current customers and how do you expect any sense that if the line draws are less at this point that youre going to start to see somebodys just get paid down if in fact we do get the vshape and how quickly thanks donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would actually say we are seeing some pay downs already i think early days say the first two weeks of the pandemic we saw a lot of preemptive draws inside particularly in the kind of bbb segment which is where they were concentrated so the bigger companies felt very liquid with strong balance sheet the weaker companies frankly dont have a lot of capacity to draw so theyre really concentrated in the crossover sector some of those are starting to come back and what weve seen over the last actually two weeks is more deposit inflow kind of in scale than weve seen line draws so i think there is a lot of just very defensive behavior early on as companies got their heads around one citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 whether their banks were going to be there and i think a lot of ph thems testing banks and those are beginning to come back and then just where was this thing going and lets garner as much liquidity so the market seems to have calmed down significantly people will draw and pay back but we see it kind of regular way right now and what we do expect is some of those deposits to be beginning to be used as companies go through periods of disruption so we would expect a regular downdraft of the deposits that are sitting with us and thats really why we did this cash burn analysis that i talked about on gerards question we can really see it client by client and track it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island to make sure our analytics are right bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think the important thing don too is that we did see nice deposit growth away from just the companies who were drawing funds donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly exactly bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ken i think theres ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island a good confidence that our ldrs are going to continue to stay well behaved particularly with all the liquidity thats in the system ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah excellent and then bruce just a followup on the prior slide you talked about assessing new opportunities arising from the current environment im just wondering is that any change in what youd already been contemplating in terms of continuing to add to the franchise and what types of things do you think might appear for you strategically in that regard citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so we had done last year when we rolled out top a fair amount of work on our strategic thinking where are some opportunities where we have strength that we have a right to win that we can leverage those strengths to find new revenue streams the way we did with education refinance or we did with our merchant partnerships and so growing citizens access to digital bank taking it to the next level was one better serving small businesses smes is another and then going taking our merchant business in some new directions i think all those things still make a lot of sense and were continuing to keep up our investments there but were also looking at how has the world changed and are there additional offerings certainly the world is becoming more digital as people have to stay home and we see tremendous upsurge and folks using the online and mobile platform and so what does that mean for the future does it mean that for example the wealth offering for mass affluent that they might be more willing to be able to virtual advisors that business now going to take off so were just looking at a whole bunch of brainstorming sessions to think through the worlds going to be different how do we play how do me make some additional investments and retweak our overall way of doing business and the strategy ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right got it thank you guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thank you operator well go next to the line of john pancari with evercore isi go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi just to confirm so when it comes to your loan loss reserve level now post the build that you put through this quarter so based on what you know now and your assumption for the direction of how this plays out theres nothing you see that happened in april after you closed the books that will point to the need for an additional loan loss reserve build in second quarter for covid bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island don citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island ill start off there i mean john as i mentioned earlier i mean clearly moodys scenarios have worsened i think we have to digest what were hearing and seeing in those updates as i mentioned we have as one of our base scenarios we have gdp falling we have a vshaped recovery in the update from moodys indicates gdp falling but nevertheless still recovery later on we have an internal bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island as it relates to johns specific question about closing your books i mean that scenario came out this week and the books were closed donald h mccree a vice chairman head of commercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so i think we had the best information at the time we did our close and i think we leaned on being at the conservative end in the assumptions that we took but as we go through the month of april it may be that people think this will be a bit deeper and it may last a little longer and well have to come back and reassess that john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks yeah i just wanted to put that in context to what you were assuming in terms of the shape of the recovery and what was dialed in okay and then separately in terms of on slide your stressed analysis that you ran resulting in the what was the stressed cet1 output from when you ran that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes the stressed cet1 would be in the neighborhood in a severely adverse scenario and i guess id say this well in terms of what weve submitted for in a severely adverse scenario using our estimates of losses which we believe are quite prudent and predictive we would be in the neighborhood of of cet1 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it all right thanks and then one bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its probably a little better john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 probably a little better i mean you look at i mean thats probably maybe a temporary low point but youd be something in the and range if you go quarterbyquarter ph we did the ninequarter outlook of somewhere ranging between and john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay and did you disclose the amount of loan loss reserve against that billion of higher risk sectors that you flagged john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island no we did not john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it all right thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator we have a one last question queue from the line of saul martinez with ubs go ahead please saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking my question so i wanted to follow up on i think it was kens question just its a bigger just more bigger picture question obviously were all kind of focused on whats directly in front of us right now but during times like these you often will see more meaningful structural change more meaningful inflections in the competitive backdrop consumer behavior im wondering if you have any perspective on that have you had time to take a step back and kind of think about where the puck could be going and how this situation will influence that and in addition to that how you think about your own strategy in that environment for example does it make citizens the importance of investing and being successful with the citizens access strategy that much more important to the client acquisition tool so just more of a broader question on the industry and how you think about are you sort of recalibrate or you might recalibrate your strategic initiatives on the back of that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill ask brendan to kick off on that one brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean on the consumer side the most obvious trend is an acceleration of one that was already happening which is the drive to digitization and so i look at all the things that we have in flight some of which weve got jump on our peers like you pointed out citizens access on a national banking digital franchise like merchant and citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 finance like the future of our brickandmortar distribution network how do we reposition that for consumers that have gotten used to coming in less frequently but still being able to manage their money effectively and get advice bruce pointed out virtual wealth advisors weve got a lot of these things in motion weve got a significant investment in our mobile and online banking platform that should start to go live in beta form in q2 i view this as an acceleration of a lot of those things so were spending some time to figure out how do we get out on our front foot even more how do we capitalize on consumer trends that are changing very rapidly situationally we think they could be very sustaining and i think the level of confidence i have is high because were in a position of strength to have all of these things already in motion with teams making progress and taking share in the market so were trying to figure out which ones of those if they can choose to really put some significant acceleration and thats how i sort of see it on the consumer side saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks brendon just one quick followup on cecl then if we do see a longer recovery and not a v shaped recovery and you did give some helpful reference points on your allowance by product type and it seems this quarter the reserve build was really spread out across consumer and commercial but what segments would you think are most vulnerable to reserve trueups and because i do think your loan book is a little different from a lot of other peers you do have a lot of loan types with longer weighted average indiscernible which for any given loss content will have a higher reserve so im just curious like how we should think about sort of the evolution of those reserve rates if you were to have to build greater reserves bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so on of the materials i mean we gave some a breakout of what we what drove the saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island up basis points that we put up i mean i think what drove cecl in the first place being very punitive standard in terms of versus incurred losses as you mentioned so those categories have a lot of perhaps some longer maturities associated with them so you look at inschool as a place that would be a driver other areas where theres higher loss content but theres also higher returns such as car and unsecured saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 thats an area we keep an eye on and so thats the two that jump after me on page on the commercial front some of the areas inside commercial maybe show up with a little bit less loss content but those are the top two that i see on page saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc why is inschool so much higher than refi or maybe its an obvious answer that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean you think about that what we mentioned a little bit earlier is that and maybe brendan can comment on this but these are really high fico basically great credit risk great relationship opportunity people theyve been in the workforce from on average six years i think the average comp is a sixfigure comp type of borrower its pretty high quality versus being inschool brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island one you got usually you have a pair of guarantee on that but the thing that really kills in the cecl calculation is maturity and theres 15year loans in many cases so thats why that number is high we dont necessarily think well have any immediacy to charge off on those portfolios but thats where cecl doesnt always give you the answer you would expect and in fact delinquency on those portfolios hasnt moved much at all yet and so were early innings on watching those portfolios but were liking what were seeing so far its really duration remember inschool also has a fouryear performance period before they graduate that extends the duration there too thats really whats driving the cecl difference there saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay got to close it up thanks saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right thank you bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure so anyway thanks everyone for dialing in today we
