you dorothy good morning i hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy we are pleased with our second quarter results and the ongoing implementation of the onb way strategic initiatives including our recent announcement regarding our technology partnership with infosys we have begun our transition to a return to the workplace including reopening our lobbies and bringing our team members back to the old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 office but admittedly we are slowing down our transition as the number of positive cases are increasing across our footprint our lobbies remain open and we are committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members clients and communities i would also like to thank our team members for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients and communities in this challenging environment starting with slide our second quarter net income was million including million in aftertax onb way charges adjusted net income was higher at million which includes million in provision for expected credit losses and million in provision for unfunded commitments these provisions are consistent with the most recent moodys economic forecast brendon will fill you in on all the details end of period total loans increased by billion primarily due to ppp loan funding and commercial real estate growth our commercial production excluding ppp loan production was million slightly higher than the first quarter line utilization dropped to due to line payoffs and an increase in new unused lines of credit corer deposit growth of billion funded by ppp proceeds and higher savings rates were a bright spot net interest income was higher from ppp income which offset the impact of lower interest rates mortgage and capital markets revenue continue to be exceptionally strong and offset covidrelated lower deposit service charge and interchange income we continue to achieve lower expenses as we execute on the onb way initiatives our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was under yearoveryear operating leverage improved by almost basis points our credit quality metrics improved during the quarter but we expect that losses will ultimately materialize once the stimulus and deferral programs run their course we still dont completely appreciate the depth of the crisis but we believe our historically strong underwriting practices diverse and greater loan portfolios and midwest footprint should help us weather the impact better than most we continue to share with our board of directors multiple economic forecast and various stress tests as a result we dont anticipate any other capital actions and we expect to maintain our current dividend were still open for business and were extending new credit we manage for the long term our balance sheet and capital markets our balance sheet capital markets are strong our markets are diverse and our experienced team will help us manage through this challenging time im confident that we will emerge even stronger on the other side moving to slide i want to update you on our recently announced technology partnership with infosys as a part of the onb way we hired outside experts to help us examine our current technology infrastructure investments and talent the technology investments required for financial services are only accelerating and we recognize the need for a strong partner to help us maximize the benefits from those increased investments this multiyear technology partnership will fund those accelerated investments in technology infrastructure improve our training and development opportunities and increase our innovation we are confident that over time this partnership will significantly enhance our client experiences and provide even greater scale to grow our bank efficiently and effectively not only is infosys a leading global information technology company they are also making a million investment in the state of indiana with plans to hire workers and they are building their us training center in indianapolis ill now turn the call over to daryl old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 daryl d moore chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp thank you jim i will begin my portion of this mornings presentation on the top half of slide where we lay out for you our exposure to what we believe to be the most vulnerable segments of our commercial portfolio with regard to the particular industries noted you can see that none of the six identified vulnerable segments exceeds of total loans and the total exposure of all of these identified segments are just of total loans we believe that a critical factor in determining the staying power of our borrowers in this very challenging economic environment is not only the level of capital each of these borrowers brought into this downturn but also the ability to raise additional capital if needed in that regard to the extent that they are forgiven ppp loans represent outside equity contributions to our borrowers and especially with respect to these vulnerable industries we imagine that these capital injections are going to be instrumental in assisting our borrowers in navigating through the current crisis if were correct in our assessment of the criticality of having access of outside capital sources its interesting to note that we approved over million in ppp loans to borrowers in these six vulnerable industry segments which represent just shy of of the total preppp loan outstandings of these industries we continue to work through the portfolio to rate our borrowers on their precovid strength in areas of liquidity capital the ability to service debt obligations and loan structure as a baseline for understanding to what extent the current pandemic could impact those borrowers as we began to receive interim financial results from our borrowers we will use that information to further inform our understanding of the underlying strengths or weaknesses in each individual relationship and take actions as appropriate with respect to the retail side of the loan portfolio the chart at the bottom of slide provide some information around retail product exposures and a proxy of credit quality based upon average fico scores delinquencies and losses in these portfolios as a whole are performing better than they did through the first half of last year but we are very guarded in our view of those trends given the level of payment deferrals granted and the fact that we have had a moratorium on most repossessions for four months moving to slide we provide more information on deferrals showing that we have booked deferrals on of our commercial book and roughly on each of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios equating to an deferral rate on the entire portfolio first time deferral requests have slowed to a trickle and we are just now beginning to consider requests for the extensions of any first round 90day deferrals to the extent audio gap requesting deferral period extensions we have had the or we will have the opportunity to spend a bit more time analyzing extension requests than we did on the front end and well use the baseline information on liquidity capital debt serviceability and loan structure that i mentioned earlier to ensure that we use this window of opportunity to strengthen credits where we can in consideration of any further concessions moving to the bottom half of slide were pleased to report that we have extended in excess of billion in paycheck protection program loans to over borrowers as you can see from the chart almost of the loans extended were to entities or individuals whose ppp loan size fell in or less category affirming our position as a large bank with a community focus there has been a team of individuals that have spent significant hours in building up the forgiveness process for these loans which we will be ready to be utilized by our clients once the sba is open to receiving those requests on slide we provide an overview of credit quality measures 30plusday delinquencies at basis points fell to levels not seen for at least years in this organization as i mentioned earlier it is critically important to keep in mind that borrower assistance in the form of ppp loans payment deferrals and sba loan payment supplements old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 have certainly helped to damper any increase in delinquencies we might have seen absent this assistance it is yet to be seen what impact any winddown of these programs might have on delinquency rates going forward net chargeoffs in the quarter fell to more historically normal levels net chargeoffs in the period were slightly more than million or basis points of average loans nonperforming loans fell basis points in the quarter in small part due to a slight decline in nonperforming balances but mostly as a result of increased loan balances associated with the paycheck protection program in the final section of this slide we look at the historical relationship of net chargeoffs to nonperforming loans while on a somewhat increasing trend due to higher fourth quarter and first quarter losses you can see the significant difference between old national and our peers when it comes to this particular metric with that ill turn the call over to brendon brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you daryl before turning to the quarterly financials we would like to provide an overview of our allowance for credit losses our seasonal model assumptions were again derived from the moodys baseline forecast which is now projecting high or prolonged unemployment and a sharper initial decline in gdp compared to our first quarter assumption its updated economic outlook is the primary driver of the million reserve increase this quarter our current acl to loan ratio including ppp loan stands at basis points excluding ppp loans our allowance to loan ratio would be basis points i would also like to remind you that we continue to carry million in unamortized credit marks from our acquired portfolio in addition to the allowance held on these loans while these marks will not directly offset chargeoffs any remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution the fiscal stimulus and relief programs have been an effective mitigants to credit losses in the near term however theres still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path of the virus future government actions and the longterm health of the economy all of which could impact future reserve needs that said our reserve levels reflect the current economic outlook and is our best estimate of the credit losses in the portfolio today turning to the quarter on slide our gaap earnings per share was and our adjusted earnings per share was adjusted earnings per share excludes million in onb way related charges moving to slide we are pleased with our quarterly adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue which was higher yearoveryear and higher over prior quarter this improvement was driven by increased fee income led by our mortgage and capital markets businesses as well as the reduction in adjusted operating expenses resulting from good execution of our onb way initiative despite the challenging interest rate environment we improved operating leverage by basis points yearoveryear slide shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning assets mix end of period loans increased billion quarteroverquarter due to billion in ppp loans commercial real estate loans grew at a annualized rate while ci loans excluding ppp were down million due to decreases in revolving line utilization commercial activity continue to be strong with total production excluding ppp of million and an endofperiod pipeline totaling billion loan yields excluding ppp were for the quarter reflecting the full impact of the decline in shortterm rates coupled with lower new business rates which average the investment portfolio yield was down basis points quarteroverquarter to with new purchases yielding old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 moving to slide both periodend and average deposits increased during the quarter as a significant amount of ppp loan funds were deposited and remained on the book at quarter end deposits also benefited from a broad increase in savings rates as well as seasonal increases in public funds our total cost of deposits declined from basis points in the first quarter to a low basis points in q2 while we continue to look for opportunities to reduce funding costs most of our planned rate actions are now complete time deposit cost fell basis points to and we expect this trend to continue for several quarters as the majority of our cd book reprices within the next months overall we are pleased with the results of our deposit pricing strategy as a result of a meaningful reduction in deposit costs while maintaining our core client base next on slide you will see the detailed changes in our second quarter net interest income and corresponding margin net interest margin declined basis points quarteroverquarter and was generally in line with our expectations ppp loans contributed approximately million to net interest income but have a negative basis point impact on net interest margin excluding the impact of both ppp loans and accretion net interest margin was compared to in q1 the reduction in core earning asset yields which were down basis points was only partially offset by a basis point reduction in funding costs this trend in our margin will likely continue as our earning assets reprice in this lower longterm rate environment slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income our second quarter adjusted noninterest income was million and represent a million increase over prior quarter the primary driver of this improvement came from our mortgage business mortgage revenue was million in q2 which represents a million increase over prior quarter and a million increase over q2 mortgage production was a record million with coming from the purchase category the pipeline also remains a strong million heading into the third quarter please note we did take an impairment charge to our msr portfolio in q2 that is netted against our mortgage revenue the capital markets line of business remains a bright spot as interest rate swaps continue to be very attractive to clients our wealth business benefited from seasonal tax prep fees this quarter the lower equity market values did have a modest negative impact on both investment and trust revenues as expected bank fees were down million compared to prior quarter driven by a significant decrease in overdraft ph percentness interchange income also came under pressure in q2 but its rebounded nicely from its midquarter low point as spending patterns slowly return to normal with our local economies reopened next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which reflects our ongoing focus on expense management onb way charges were million this quarter which is slightly better than the million we projected adjusting for these onb way charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was down million quarteroverquarter our onb way expense initiatives have resulted in a yearoveryear reduction in branches and yearoveryear reduction in ftes also worth noting is that our second quarter noninterest expenses included an increase in our allowance for unfunded commitments of million our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was a low and represents a basis point improvement over q1 as i wrap up my discussion on the quarter here are some key takeaways we are pleased with our overall performance that the fundamentals of our core business were strong commercial production was solid our fee old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 businesses continue to perform well particularly our mortgage and capital market clients and we delivered on the promised expense savings we outlined in our onb way strategic plan slide include thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we ended a quarter with a healthy billion commercial pipeline but economic uncertainty may impact pullthrough rates and mute loan growth in the near term the impact on our net interest margin to the short end of the curve is now largely behind us but historically low longterm rates will continue to put pressure on asset yields as our loan and investment portfolio is repriced at lower coupons funding costs will move marginally lower as borrowings and cds reprice at maturity but we do not expect this will be sufficient to offset declines in asset yields ppp loans will also impact our margin going forward these loans carry a coupon and an average fee of approximately and will continue to be accretive through margin on a level yield over their twoyear terms as loans are forgiven any remaining fee will be accretive to income immediately the timing of loan forgiveness is still uncertain but we dont expect significant payoffs to begin until late this year several fee items will also likely come under pressure from the economic slowdown our wealth management and investment businesses have seen a decline in the valuation of our assets under management that will impact revenue in the near term overdraft fees were down sharply in the quarter and may take some time to recover to precrisis levels the mortgage market has proven more resilient than we expected but will still be subject to the typical seasonal declines in the back half of the year we are slightly ahead of our planned onb way expense initiative and have now realized a large portion of the savings promised this year the infosys partnership is expected to generate approximately million in onetime charges associated with upgrading our it infrastructure and will be recognized over the next several quarters we would also like to give you an update on our current capital position and outlook we accreted an additional basis points of cet1 capital ending the quarter at a healthy i would also reiterate that based on current capital levels and our outlook on earnings we believe we will continue to outearn our dividend weve also recently updated our stress test model and under the ccar severely adverse scenario we remain well capitalized at the lowest point in the ninequarter horizon our liquidity position also remains very strong with our low loantodeposit ratio of strong cash and unencumbered security position and various sources of liquidity we have plenty of flexibility to respond to future funding needs lastly we have provided some guidance on our fullyear tax rate which is expected to be approximately on an fte basis and on a gaap basis as we previously reported project delays caused by covid have impacted the timing of our other historic tax credit projects that we anticipated will be completed this year those projects have recently restarted and barring additional delays the projects could be placed in service by yearend if these projects are completed in q4 we will take the full tax credit amortization and corresponding tax benefit in that quarter with that were happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp what a shock good morning scott daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning hope you guys are doing well and appreciate you taking the question just wanted to ask one question on the reserve i mean the credit numbers are excellent of course and you guys have such a solid history but the only area where old national looks light is just on the reservetoloan ratio i feel like i know you guys well enough to understand the nuance but just any thought you might have had to perhaps say ramping up the qualitative reserve just given the uncertainty in the outlook or sort of what were the factors that got you to this as the appropriate level brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp sure so obviously scott we build our models based on historical results and we run the moodys baseline forecast through and trust that the models are accurate and appropriate given the economic outlook i will say that we also did add some additional qualitative reserve to the model this year but we feel really really comfortable with where our reserve levels stand given the economic forecast that moodys provided james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp and scott its hard to know exactly what the right answer is in this kind of environment and we think we provided an appropriate amount given our history of our portfolio and our granular the granular nature of the portfolio the diverse nature of the portfolio so the board and management are very comfortable with where our reserve stands today r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect i appreciate that color and then brendon just maybe i think since none of us has really gone through a credit cycle with sort of credit marks the way they are you got a million credit mark to what extent is that indeed available to absorb loss i think you touched on it in your prep remarks but just any additional color you could add would be great brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 yeah the accounting wont allow you to specifically offset a chargeoff but that but those credit marks are on the books and will increase through earnings and available to help fund provisions in the event we need it as we go forward and if a loan is resolved if a loan is charged off we will accrete that credit mark straight to earnings in that period although the geography will be different r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah got it all right perfect thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody brendon if i could start with you on the ppp program just looking for a couple of numbers and then a couple of outlook questions i think you said in your prepared remarks average fee whats the total fees that are yet to be realized aside from the brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp so its just shy of million left to be accreted taking about ph million of that million christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and the average balances of the ppp loans in the quarter do you have that brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp the average balances i dont have that oh average for the balance for the entire portfolio billion sorry i thought indiscernible christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so if i think of the roughly i think you said million in the quarter of total revenues from the ppp most of that would be the what do you i guess how do we think about the cadence of that million brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 yeah the million that we took in the quarter was roughly split between fees and coupon and wed love to get as much of this into as we can were jim sandgren has a process to be proactive with the borrowers i think theyre anxious to get this behind them as well but until the sba gives us a way to submit these were all a little uncertain obviously theres been extension to the time to allocate eligible expenses and so were not sure but our best thought is that this is more a fourth quarter and beyond income event christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then last question on the ppp the deposits that are associated with it can you just speak to the trajectory of the stickiness of those deposits do we need to assume as the loans run into kind of one for one or how are you viewing those the surge in deposits james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah chris this is jim its hard to say but i would assume certainly in the quarter that youll start to see some of those balances run down as theyre being used for the reason theyve been provided so hard to say one to one but i would think wed start seeing those balances reduce in the quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then my last one ill jump out brendon you talked about the margin just for long and being just the environment being not great for the group if i take the core core margin i think it was around basis points of compression do we assume a lesser degree of pressure because weve now felt the short end or is it are you messaging that we should see similar pressure in the back half of the year ph for quarter brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes i think in the near term next several next couple of quarters i think a similar trend downward is probably appropriate but then well begin to flatten from there but the longer this curve exits i think well continue to see some pressure for some time going forward and chris maybe just one other point to your prior question the buildup in deposits associated with ppp which is roughly half of the billion increase came from ppp christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thanks a lot brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp okay operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe start with a question on slide the vulnerable industries as you guys describe them changed from the first quarter to the second quarter a few kind of came out and a few new ones were put in like cre kind of senior housing could you just talk about over the last three months how youve looked at those loan portfolios and why you made the decision to say remove transportation and add senior housing daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah terry this is daryl the transportation segment we put that on because right out of the box there seemed to be a lot of talk about transportation as we went back and looked at our portfolio most of that transportation exposure is in hauling either shortterm hauling or low hauling within individual regions so we just didnt see much deterioration there as we pull that out we also looked at our senior housing portfolio which up before the covid crisis had shown just a little bit of weakness and so we thought if you think about that particular industry its difficult to bring new clients into the assisted living just because of the covid and theres been lots of different protocols they were struggling with finding employees before the crisis its just difficult increased costs associated with this industry so we thought you know what we just really need to be keeping our eyes on that and so we thought it was more appropriate to swap those two out just to give you a better picture of where our vulnerabilities might be going forward james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp terry i tell you the entire leadership team goes through these portfolios credit by credit looking at the current disposition any potential future downgrades and so were spending a awful lot of time focusing on it and feel good as we can today about those credits but we do spend an awful lot of time making sure that were managing this portfolio appropriately terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a follow up maybe i mean were seeing weakness in service charges interchange revenue just across the industry any way you could put some numbers behind maybe when and how much it bottomed out with the recovery through kind of the second quarter as it progressed and what your thoughts are now that theres been some kind of taking some steps back on the opening and some closures in some of your core markets and what that could mean to this fee line brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp hey terry this is brendon i can help you with the service charges so overdraft really drove most of our service charge decline and we have not seen any meaningful rebound its been down and has basically remained down and thats approximately million for that shortfall we felt in q1 to q2 dont expect that to change as far as interchange income its probably a million million worth of headwind in q2 but that has rebounded really back to fairly normal levels so i dont think that will be a concern going forward for us old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp i think the service charges obviously are being impacted by the stimulus programs and the extended benefits and to the extent that those continue on into the future you will probably still see that line item under pressure but to the extent that those start winding down i think youd probably see a return to normal terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks everyone james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning daryl maybe a question for you on slide you talked about the second round of deferral discussions just starting to occur give us an idea of what youre thinking in terms of what this slide might look like a quarter from now i know you said that the activity has slowed pretty dramatically but talk a little bit about what youre seeing in terms of the flow coming in for a second round daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah jon a great question if you kind of recall our last call we basically split about on deferrals greater than days and deferrals less than days weve got about half of the deferrals that are coming back in and it is a little slower than i had thought maybe on the front end although i dont know that i would extend kind of that thinking to the fact that maybe a lot of those days dont ask for extensions so its yet to be seen there i think new extension or new deferral requests if based upon the last or days i just dont think were going to see significantly higher requests so i dont know that youre going to see higher percentages of these portfolios than what we have now if that answers your question james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp jon i would also add as weve gone through these weve seen many of these early requests were planning for the worst case scenario the worst case in terms of rent collection whether itd be commercial or individual rents and we are if we go through these loans one by one were hearing pretty positive things about their ability so im hopeful that as we go through these renewals or as these mature that well go back to a normal cadence with our borrowers old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then another challenging question i guess as well but scott kind of alluded to it earlier in terms of the reserves and provision outlook are you saying that your reserves today reflect some of the individual stresses that youre seeing in the portfolio as well or is it just more of using the moodys overlay and making some modest adjustments to that so its more of a macro approach that makes sense is it macro or loan by loan brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp so certainly were using the moodys as the macroeconomic factor overlay but we use all of our individual asset quality ratings ltvs all the individual borrower characteristics which generally the migration patterns have been very strong even through this crisis so we are using granular loan portfolio data in our assumptions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so a chance the provision backs off a bit if a lot of those moodys numbers if we are in the ballpark brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp if the moodys scenario plays out i dont think well see a meaningful reduction in the reserve but it should prove up the reserve is adequate for the losses in our portfolio jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then i guess one more in a positive way the pipeline hanging in there curious on the dynamics and the drivers that were all obviously focused on credit but just curious on the new business pipeline as that one kind of piqued my james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yes yeah jon this is jim ill take that one really encouraged by the size of the pipeline but maybe more encouraged by the category so the accepted category which traditionally we get to of those loans across the finish line that stays stable quarteroverquarter where we did see some growth in the pipeline was in the proposal stage so anecdotal feedback from our borrowers through our commercial rms is that folks have a little bit more clarity theyre optimistic for the second half of the year our pull through rates were down a little bit in certainly in the second quarter so well see if projects continue but people are talking about acquisitions still talking about some growth so well see were very encouraged about what could happen in the third quarter but well have to just wait and see how things play out but pretty well split between commercial real estate and ci so james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp jon i also add all three segment leaders have been really focused in on what can they do to help our clients and what can we do to continue to grow each one of those businesses so while the second quarter early parts of the second quarter were probably distracted with ppp production and things like that were really focusing in on old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 kind of coming back and working hard making sure were serving our clients and looking for opportunities to grow each one of those segments jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thanks for taking my call as it relates to the ppp the duration of those loans are you amortizing the fees assuming you dont get forgiveness over two years or do you have some that are in the five year category brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp we are amortizing these all over the two years david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay a indiscernible david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it got it thank you and then the just the overall deposit trends if i can get a little bit more color there obviously the ppp may be a little bit of a headwind the public funds may be a little bit of a headwind here in the third quarter can you grow deposits in the third quarter maybe just talk about broader trends daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp i think the trends will be fairly stable with what youve seen in the past so we just saw increased savings rate across every category every product type business personal and public in the quarter and i think jim alluded these comments earlier as stimulus payments sort of draw down and ppp funds get kind of forgiven and redeployed well start to see that come down and then well probably return back to normal deposit trend growth old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2020 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator and there are no further questions at this time james c ryan iii chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp great well we appreciate you all joining us today we hope
