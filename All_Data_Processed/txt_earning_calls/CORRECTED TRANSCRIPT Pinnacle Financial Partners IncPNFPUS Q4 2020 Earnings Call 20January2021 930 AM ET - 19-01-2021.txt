other risks is contained in pinnacle financials annual report on s listen to our earnings calls and so forth and so in the class immediately following the assignment to listen to our earnings call he told me that he opened it with just an openend question to sort of get their overarching reaction to the call and he said that they had two overarching reactions he said one those guys sure sound optimistic and two they sure sound southern and so my guess is that following our call today you may have the same reaction fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter for us we had key success measures like asset quality core deposit growth fee income growth preprovision net revenue growth and tangible book value accretion all very strong during the quarter we began every quarterly call with this dashboard reflecting our key performance metrics on a pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 gaap basis but honestly theres so many adjustments required in order to focus on the variables that were truly managing here at pinnacle that i want to move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted nongaap measures as you can see here on the top row total revenues fully diluted eps and adjusted ppnr are all up meaningfully on a quarterly basis revenues are up roughly yearoveryear at a time when many have been predicting banks cannot earn in what they earned in we are very proud that our second half fully diluted eps exceeded 2019s by adjusted ppnr for is up nearly over while ppnr per share is up along the second row you can see that loans are up yearend compared to last year harold will review in greater detail shortly and talk about our expectations going forward but generally we continue to believe well produce loan growth primarily based on our ability to take market share due to our prolific hiring weve hired revenue producers over the last two years and thats more than of our total revenue producers that represents enormous market share movement potential which i expect differentiates our growth opportunity from many if not most of our peers core deposits continued to accelerate at a rapid pace during the quarter and for the entire year and in spite of the covid challenges we continue to have a track record for consistently growing tangible book value per share with nearly growth in tangible book value per share in across the bottom row you can see that asset quality held up really well in the fourth quarter with npas of just basis points classified assets actually down this quarter to the lowest level in the last five years and annualized net chargeoffs of just basis points in the quarter im going to turn it over to harold and tim to review the results in much greater detail as we go through the details i find that theres a lot to be encouraged about regarding our net interest margin fundamentals particularly the trajectory of our cost to deposits fee income was solid this quarter mortgage had a great year bhgs report card during this pandemic continues to outperform expectations our revenue per share for was thats up nearly from this time last year and significantly better than the median peer comparisons we talked about our transition to defense earlier in allocating a meaningful part of our human capital to reviewing our loan book borrowerbyborrower tims going to update you on the work that he and his team accomplished in q4 as well as give you insight on what were seeing and learning from our clients at least for me our asset quality performance inspired optimism though as we all know there are still unknowns relative to vaccine rollout and the full reopening of the economy so harold let me turn it over to you harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody many of our slides weve shown for quite some time and fourth quarter results were basically consistent with what weve anticipated from last time so i dont believe theres a ton of new information so ill hit the highlights pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 we did experience some wealth of loan growth for the fourth quarter excluding ppp we were up almost annualized between third quarter and fourth quarter we dont have a trend just yet but it was a positive signal we will lean on our new hires over the last few years to give us an advantage on loan growth as you know were in great markets we dont apologize for any market where we do business so we think that too will help us outperform when entrepreneurs begin to see the fog lift and we see loan growth reemerge in a more predictable way that said our market leaders believe that loan growth forecasts excluding ppp of high singledigit growth in is a reasonable number for our firm as to loan yields exppp loan yields were pretty flat keeping loan yields will be a fight in we will lean into our relationships even harder to maintain our yields granted the steepening curve should be helpful to us but theres a lot of liquidity out there so finding borrowers is more difficult plus youve got a lot of banks out there using pricing as leverage because i dont know a bank that doesnt have a considerable amount of own balance sheet liquidity the ppp program is back in the news and were excited about deploying the next round of funding and hopeful we can place a meaningful amount during the first half of although we dont expect to have similar level of ppp volumes in the second round as the first we do believe were ready to be just as successful in the second round as the first and also believe this will be incredibly beneficial to those small businesses in our market that continue to be impacted by the pandemic over the last few weeks for those clients that we that are interested in the second round we preloaded data files to expedite the process so weve surveyed these clients and are contacting them currently to explain the new program and gauge their interest as of close of business yesterday weve received approximately applications totaling almost million so were off to a pretty rapid start as to the first round forgiveness process it remains rigorous but our team is working through with our clients we expect net interest income lift we expected net interest income lift in the fourth quarter through the ppp forgiveness and expect more lift in the first half of now onto deposits we had another big deposit quarter weve experienced significant growth in noninterest bearing deposits ending at billion at quarter end up since last year the number of commercial checking accounts is up almost since yearend our average loans to average deposits was at its lowest level than i can ever remember at we expect to reverse that trend at some point in we were at basis points on average deposits at the yearend and at basis points for eop rates we are intentional about getting those numbers down to less than basis points very quickly were getting a few questions about deploying excess liquidity were beginning to get interested in various ways to leverage some of this cash flow given the steepening of the yield curve but well be very cautious in whatever new opportunities we see to deploy excess cash so we will have an opportunity to reduce our wholesale funding book over the next several quarters which we fully anticipate doing this reduction should help reduce funding costs across the board and help our nim similar to what some other banks announced during the quarter although our opportunity wasnt nearly as large as others we did redeem million of federal home loan bank borrowings prior to maturity and incurred a million prepayment penalty we also unwound a cash flow hedge set to start in january that weve been pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 carrying for a few years combined loss of around million between the two but should be paid back within two years we have other opportunities with federal home loan borrowings that we will evaluate prospectively but the payback period is too long currently for us to get excited about those right now as for the cash flow hedge due to liquidity swell we no longer have the need to carry the wholesale funding that was hedged by the swap therefore we recognize the previous unrealized loss once we cancel the funding by paying off the federal home loan bank advance early and unwinding the cash flow hedge we should stay close to million in interest expense in our liquidity build cost us approximately million a quarter we will shed this excess liquidity at some point likely more slower than wed like we believe that both ppp and our excess liquidity negatively impact our fourth quarter nim by basis points which is down from basis points in the third quarter we believe our nim after ppp and liquidity is approximately this compares to a similar calculation last quarter of so were up basis points from the previous quarter thus our adjusted nim is up two quarters in a row we call that a trend seriously this will be a big focus of our bank going into now to fee income ill be brief fees were more than million for the quarter for the year fee revenues grew in which we believe was remarkable everyone knows that was a power year for mortgage we dont expect to repeat in but then again mortgage doesnt get a pass either ill talk more about bhg in a few minutes but bhg continues to issue great report cards every quarter wealth management had a big year as their fees were up yearoveryear we expect they will have a great year in as they have made several key hires in the latter part of across our markets as to expenses as weve stated in the press release expenses were higher than anticipated due to a discretionary bonus award approved by our board last week as weve stated in the past our annual cash incentive is tied directly to results due to covid we failed to hit our eps targets this year due primarily to the required increased provision as a result of cecl adoption during the year and as i mentioned last quarter we modified our cash incentive plan to incorporate a ppnr component all in our plan would have calculated a target opportunity based on the modified structure of the plan our ppnr results will help us ramp into with a lot of momentum the board elected to increment their award for participating associates modestly to of target given the impact of covid to our results just so you know missing our target payout on incentives resulted in million in savings to our results coupled with a similar issue for equity incentive compensation that was another million in savings in that approximate per share that found its way to our bottom line and into tangible capital in speaking for the employees of our firm were hopeful those savings arent repeated in all of us obviously are pleased with the boards decision and what the additional means to some client participants that said we missed this year and the focus for will be to overachieve so our plan design will still target top quartile performance within our peer group and still incorporate both eps and ppnr targets pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 the leadership of our firm is determined to not let a trend develop on less than target payout to our associates thats a trend we will work hard to avoid and to do it we will look forward to meeting and exceeding our financial objectives in quickly some comments on capital our board has approved authorization of million buyback program the previous program expired at yearend we will begin to consider deployment of those funds soon but are not likely to see any material impact from the authorization in the first quarter of we also have a couple of sub debt issuance that are up for renewal this year so we will consider redemption andor refinance in due course the board increased the quarterly dividend yesterday so given all of our associates our shareholders we were grateful for that as well we are a firm that works on many things we are focused on growing earnings per share and ppnr in an outsized way and we are also intentional about growing tangible book value per share weve accomplished a lot of things this year ph than one thing we are particularly proud of is that since that time weve increased our tangible book value per share by we will continue our focus on tangible book value per share growth im not going through this slide in depth as we have covered most of this previously obviously we appear more optimistic than most that said we have a great confidence in our people our markets and our clients and renewed optimism around reopening of our local economies now to bhg this is a familiar slide to most and provides a snapshot of bhgs business flows over time and more importantly how theyre holding up during the pandemic the blue bars on the chart are originations that have ramped up with more loans being funded with records being set nearly every quarter for the past three years business flows are strong and their model is hitting on all cylinders the green bars represent loans in which gain on sale has been recorded as these loans are sold to downstream banks this is the traditional bhg model with gain on sale revenues being generated as you can see the green bars are fairly flat not necessarily because of the appetite for their loans has decreased but because of the building of balance sheet loans and diversifying their business model with interest income coupons have fluctuated over the last three years ending down at for the fourth quarter as to bank buy rate they also fell to in the fourth quarter the good news is that net spreads remain in the mid which over time has been up from previous years the bottomright chart details now over banks in bhgs network and almost individual banks acquired bhgs loans in this has to be one of the strongest funding platforms for our gainonsale model in the country there are firms out there trying to replicate this but theyve got to get real busy real fast to find a funding platform like bhg like i said last time its taken years but it belongs to bhg they own it they developed it and they capitalize on it the top left chart weve shown on several occasions the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily in the past and over the last few years but particularly in they continue to refine their scorecards and increase the quality of their borrowing base again the right chart and as ive said before maybe the most powerful chart i have to offer related to bhgs steadily improving credit quality looking at losses by vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination thus pointing toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans pandemicrelated events will likely cause these pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 losses to move upward but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and is much higher than the borrowers from just a few years ago weve updated bhg chargeoffs and reserve build chart these are for loans that bhg has sold to their network of community banks the green bar shows that currently they have more than billion in credit with banks who have acquired bhg loans the orange line details the annual loss rate while the blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks losses landed at basically consistent with the last few years and during a year where who knew how covid would impact loss rates the recourse obligation reserve is used to reserve for future losses for the loans sold to other banks with covid they increased the reserve in the first quarter and incremented it slightly one note that may be of important interest to some included in the is also prepayment losses related to early payoffs so good borrowers that pay off early bhg reimburses the bank for unpaid premium just so you know that makes up about of the yeartodate loss rates we dont anticipate any significant lift in recourse reserves in lastly we said it last quarter and well say it again its been a big year for bhg and we anticipate big things in during the third quarter of the credit markets improved which allowed bhg ph operating to execute on their first million securitization appreciate that that securitization went out with investment grade rating this allows bhg to continue to diversify its revenue stream not so much away from gain on sale but with incrementally more interest income as well as provide another competitivelypriced funding source to its business model were expecting another similar securitization at bhg in early the chart on the top right is a little new it shows the trends related to the more important line items on bhgs balance sheet as noted at yearend bhg held over million in cash and slightly over billion in loans funded by almost million in borrowings the red bar i found both interesting and comforting bhg has over million in reserves and capital its a healthy franchise its a sound franchise so wrapping up loan growth at pinnacle in will take work but we are optimistic loan pricing in the fourth quarter held deposit growth has been remarkable deposit pricing is headed down bhg had another great year and credit for both pinnacle and bhg is very much manageable to say im pleased with how this quarter and year ended up is again an understatement its difficult to relate a significant effort that my colleagues are putting forth every day working with clients and solving their problems through this weird time we all know its a difficult operating environment loan demand is sluggish at best and who knows where the yield curve is headed however the bright spots for pinnacle are ph met depositors continue to trust us and borrowers seem to have figured out how to manage their businesses through this cycle our operating leverage also remains top quartile we do have the best clients and discipline remains very important additionally and hopefully covid19 finds its way to our rear view mirror last quarter we had hoped for an effective vaccine this quarter we have a vaccine in fact we have many vaccines hope has transitioned to tangible optimism our recruiting platform is scoring all over the franchise we do like our franchise and where we do business and with whom we do business pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 migration patterns continue to favor tennessee the carolinas and georgia we like our competitive prospects we remain a force in tennessee as well as in several markets in the carolinas were winning in charlotte raleigh charleston and as ive said before we think we can score big in atlanta so with that ill turn it over to tim to talk about growth timothy h huestis chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you harold using the traditional credit metrics of net chargeoffs npas classified assets and past due loans pinnacles loan portfolio continues to hold up very well we acknowledged that for some of our clients the first half of may prove challenging but we remain optimistic given the combination of the new stimulus package additional ppp loans for our clients and the covid vaccines as in the prior two quarters our bankers and credit teams completed thorough client credit reviews by collecting monthly financial statements andor rent rolls to reevaluate our borrowers assigned risk grade particularly emphasis was placed on a nonpass credit and on the loans that we had rated a low pass risk grade due to covid the results for our fourth quarter work were encouraging our classified assets decreased million for criticized loan category we had a modest net increase of million this minor increase was in part attributing to three hotel construction loans that construction had just been completed during the fourth quarter we moved these hotel loans into a criticized rating to be consistent with our conservative hospitality grading methodology applied in prior quarters the balance was made up of small loans and an assortment of property types or industries similar to the second and third quarters during the last two weeks of december we conducted a fourquestion survey of ci clients with loan balances totaling million the survey was targeted at our lowpass grade clients in a wide variety of segments such as entertainment restaurants and consumer services three of the questions were asking to borrowers estimates of revenue for fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter first quarter revenue of to first quarter full year revenue for compared to full year and the last question was regarding months of liquidity on hand to cover operating expenses the responses remained guardedly optimistic said fourth quarter revenue would be between to of fourth quarter estimated first quarter revenue would be between to of first quarter estimated full year revenue for to be between to for yearend and reported seven months of liquidity or greater during the first and second quarters of when covids economic impact was largely unknown pinnacle proactively reached out to clients to offer loan payment deferrals our payment deferrals range from to days and were administered with minimal credit qualification given the obvious challenges at that time we did not attempt to reunderwrite and assign new borrower risk grade we approached the deferrals as a shortterm solution or a band aid to help clients in a period of uncertainty with very little incremental risk to us in our view pinnacles philosophy regarding loan modifications is much different our modifications were negotiated from the framework as a longerterm solution to help our client bridge to the other side of covid our philosophy was to improve the banks position and to simultaneously help our client pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 with each modification we collected very current borrower financial information in our efforts to accurately rerisk rate the borrower and to contemplate the terms of our modification a key distinction between our deferrals in modification is that the vast majority of our clients with the modification are paying interest monthly as illustrated in the table our hotel loans make up of our total modifications of our hotel loans have a modification while each individual hotel loan modification was negotiated to fit the borrowers specific circumstances our modifications generally consisted of changing the loan repayment terms to interest only for to months in consideration for borrower concessions such as pay the accrued interest that accumulated during the earlier deferral period establish an interest reserve on deposit with pinnacle and shorten the loan maturity as illustrated in our supplemental deck our hotel book is held up our hotel portfolio occupancy for november was compared to strs national occupancy average of we attribute this to our history of conservative hospitality underwriting and our books composition of limited service economy and extendedstay hotels this slide is to provide detail around the segments of our loan portfolio that we deemed covidhigh impacts as this slide exemplifies even within these segments the performance is held up we believe a few of the contributing factors for this performance include client selection we hire experienced bankers they bring their best clients with them pinnacles very successful ppp program for our clients and finally excellent early problem loan detection coupled with a very experienced special assets team pinnacles credit metrics have held up well we will continue our clientbyclient defensive work throughout as harold indicated we will be working with our clients in the next few weeks to again deliver an outsized ppp loan program to provide them the added security and now ill hand it back to terry to talk about moving forward in this pandemic m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay thanks tim as part of our first quarter earnings call last april i told you that my expectation was in the final analysis wouldnt be about 2020s earnings but more about how well we could position our firm to return to our previous earnings trajectory following the pandemic harold and tim have done a great job of highlighting the various moves to shore up liquidity and asset quality and losstaking capacity in the form of incremental capital and loan loss reserves our board was equally nimble to provide incentive for us to focus on building ppnr which as you can see is exactly what we did in the last half of and in addition to that even in this pandemic we hired revenue producers in more than any other year in our history which i believe has served us well as were beginning to transition back to a more offensive footing and position this firm to capitalize on what some believe will be a extraordinary market sharetaking opportunity following the pandemic as i mentioned in my introductory comments in my view fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter with npas at basis points classified asset down to and past due to basis points asset quality appears excellent adjusted eps was up over the same quarter last year adjusted ppnr was up over the same quarter last year and revenues were up over the same quarter last year pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 we believe that bhg has validated the power of their differentiated model as theyve continued to originate and sell record volumes of loans through their proprietary auction platform and have also successfully securitized loans in what was the first commercial or consumer loan transaction to be rated aa by kroll on its inaugural issuance another testament to the quality and value of the assets they generate all of this during a period some predicted might be disastrous and as weve already pointed out even with the dramatic eps and ppnr growth in we still figured out how to afford to hire revenue producers in and so as was our goal we find ourselves wellpositioned to move back to offense as the pandemic subsides and economy reopens happily my guidance as we move into first quarter is that you should expect us to continue focusing on the same items weve been focused on over the last several quarters operator ill stop there and well be glad to take questions question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions analysts will be given preference during the qa operator instructions our first question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning stephen harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co so terry i guess ill follow up on your last statement there that youre back kind of on the more aggressive side of things from a hiring perspective if im doing the math right it looks like you hired maybe new harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc steve weve got some kind of weird connection i really cant understand what the question is stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay ill hop back into queue harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc if you could repeat it stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i can just hop back in the queue let me make sure my technology is working sorry about that guys operator our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc operator were having a little technical challenge were going indiscernible change rooms operator ph that sounds great jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc harold can you hear me m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc give him two seconds jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc stephen this is terry im back and im at a new room where i can i think i can hear you now so would you repeat the question pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc i dont i think stephen may have hopped off this is jennifer m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay jennifer go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay good morning guys so two questions for you number one terry you said you want to be more aggressive now again with hiring but you also have a premium currency again im wondering what your interest is in ma now versus your interest in more hiring in and thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question so just as a reminder my view today as my view has always been is that we are primarily an organic grower and our principal mechanism or core capability to get that done is our ability to attract and hire great bankers in the markets and as you know were in some really attractive markets with relatively low share positions and so i think you ought to expect that were going to continue to push on our organic growth model our hiring which we believe will be good and so thatll be the principal thrust of our company jennifer its a great question theres no doubt i guess over time ive been asked the last few years about ma and so forth and my own view was that our stock was unfairly traded and i believe that it traded at a premium as people start investing in buying stocks based on book value causes my stocks compress more than others thats my view others may have a different one but anyway the net of all of that is it did cause me to say well i wouldnt be interested in trying to deploy my stock as a currency when it is so significantly disadvantaged i dont think i would characterize ma as my principal thrust as i see it my principal thrust will be to grow organically but i think it does open up additional possibilities that can be considered and looked at and evaluated and so forth trying to make sure were making whatever the next best smart play is but again i guess i dont want that to get overweighted in my commentary there the principal mechanism we intend to deploy is organic growth primarily through hiring people jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay second question if i could what changes in your strategy do you envision postpandemic whether it be less need for corporate real estate or branches or how you meet with clients and prospects and do business or travel can you just talk about how you think that could change the pinnacle strategy over the long run m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah im confident therell be changes but honestly jennifer for us i believe that theyll be modest so just to recap why i believe that as you know were principally a commercial bank so our branching strategy has been built around that of course bnc had a little different model a little heavier in terms of branch distribution in some pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 of their markets but in the great growth markets that we desire to win in like charlotte like raleigh and then of course atlanta where weve ph de novoed i mean were at a distribution disadvantage so were not like a lot of companies that have this legacy branch distribution network that needs to get shared or trimmed back or whatever were likely on the other end of that just to sort of put that in context for you jennifer i think since we did the bnc deal we announced that in i think weve closed about offices in our footprint theyre obviously concentrated in the bnc footprint so we think weve sort of rightsized or optimized the distribution that we have again i just want to make sure you get the picture our position is that were investing in charlotte were investing in raleigh were investing in charleston south carolina and were investing in atlanta and so we could use more distribution in those markets again i think you talked about on travel and some of those variables again our strategy is a geographic strategy so were generally calling in local markets theres no doubt that today feedback is a lot of clients indiscernible you call them on the phone and come see them but thats not a meaningful dip in our travel budget and my expectation is that from a strategic standpoint the investment that were trying to make in technology i would say is focused on two things the things that we consider are generally focused on trying to keep us as a fast follower in terms of commercial capabilities were focused on the pain points of our clients not just were not trying to have the indiscernible were just trying to focus on what is it in real terms that clients need and then i guess the additional aspect of that is were trying to put our fas our financial advisors our client facing people in a position to be more effective and more productive and all that means is were trying to gather more information get it to them in a way that they can use that in advising clients and so forth so thats really where the indiscernible will be over the next several years so i dont look for major changes in our strategy i think its pretty simple and pretty much indiscernible jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks terry operator the next question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hi guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi stephen ph welcome back stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co can you hear me this time around pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes we can thank you stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay good sorry about that so im curious i know you touched on this for jennifers question but just the pace of new hires in particular i mean netnet you ended up being pretty flat for both of the last two years but it looks like about new revenue producers here in fourth quarter so i mean do you think on a relative basis could be significantly more active than the last two years on a hiring basis standpoint m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think it will be more active i think the variable stephen as you know if the vaccine is much slower coming out those kinds of things that could slow the process because the sales the length of the sale cycle whether youre recruiting people or moving business is lengthened in a covid environment so that would weigh to the negative side but i think on the positive side our reputation is really strong in the markets that were trying to grow in and the vulnerability is really high at many of the large bank competitors with whom we compete lots of turnover going on in several of those organizations and to your point the hiring was actually really strong in the fourth quarter and my expectation is that if its one way or another it ought to be stronger in than in stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it and im curious on the loan growth side of things i know harold said kind of overall demand still looks sluggish obviously you guys have benefited more from the new hires and your continual kind of hiring plan that occurred over time but im wondering especially in fourth quarter what kind of changed to the upside it seems like growth was maybe better than even you all would have anticipated say on this at this time last quarter on the call and so just kind of curious what transpired in the quarter that came out better than you would have expected and what you see apart from the new hire growth as you look into harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah stephen this is harold i wish i could put my finger directly on it but i think in large part i believe there were some construction projects that began to fund up i think also we saw some yearend ci borrowings coming in all lines of credit and im hopeful i cant put my finger on it exactly but im hopeful theres some optimism with some borrowers so maybe that will continue in the first quarter we think first quarter loan growth is going to be fairly sluggish but im hopeful that people begin to see like some renewed optimism and willing to take some risks stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it got it that makes sense and then maybe just last thing for me following up maybe a little bit on jennys ma question would be just where would the size of a potential deal need to be at this point in your life cycle to really make sense for you guys to pursue it or move the needle i mean its a lot different from when you would pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 have done ma three four years ago so im just curious what your views are in terms of maybe asset size or where someone need to be for it to be relevant m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah id just say that we focus on it more from the eps accretion standpoint than we do anything else but you can sort of back into assets size that would yield that sort of earnings accretion but generally were looking for something thats going to produce doubledigit earnings accretion itd be hard for us to get interested in doing something that didnt do that and so that said i mean you probably got to get on out there to billion bank or north to begin to produce have the chance to producing that sort of earnings accretion stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it very helpful thank you guys and congrats on a very good quarter appreciate it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you steve operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc maybe to start for harold regarding the highsingledigit guidance for expenses for is that off the base of adjusted expenses the million or is that off total million harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think you should use the million steven based on what we think on hiring and the recruitment of that incentive accrual that will probably be the number that you should use steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 okay thats helpful and then on bhg so were seeing the bank industry right start to release reserves more so this quarter do you see it likely that bhg starts to release reserves here over the near term and maybe that in the highsingledigit guidance that youre giving in terms of earnings growth ph for now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no ill say it this way based on what ive seen regarding their plans for next year i dont theres no planned reserve release so but obviously they will be monitoring that and if it looks like there should be some they will probably consider that in next years results but were not thinking that in our singledigit number steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you but if we look at where their net chargeoffs came out for the year relative to where the reserve is now it would appear theyre fairly dramatically over reserved would you agree with that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i would agree with that i think theyve built a very healthy balance sheet like i said were comforted by that balance sheet and i would not be surprised to see some reserve release next year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and then finally so if i look at the fee income outlook obviously you guys like everybody else will have this mortgage fee headwind to work through and i think youre calling for strong fee income growth in could you help us think about im not sure what you mean by strong can you help with that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill try to talk around it some mortgage were not anticipating a repeat by any stretch most of the other business units we are anticipating or expecting might be a better word strong fee growth out of the other mortgage out of the nonmortgage units that said its probably going to be somewhere around midsingle digit kind of numbers were looking at currently hopefully we can get to that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats very helpful thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you steven operator our next question comes from brett rabatin with hovde group brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi brett harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group i wanted to first just go back to talking about core deposits youre looking for i think slower deposit growth going forward but you obviously had really strong core deposit growth in the fourth quarter can you maybe just talk about the and i think you had growth in deposit account so obviously really strong can you just talk about the pace of youre slowing from here whats driving the growth in fourth quarter versus the anticipation of a slower growth profile going forward m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think there are several things going on in there brett i think number one let me back up here and try to put it in a broader perspective going back over the last couple of years we have said about and ive used this term internally as we talk with our associates that were about changing the personality of our firm i think reputationally wed be viewed to be great asset generators weve probably not been viewed to be as strong in terms of core deposit generators some of thats tied into the commercial growth of the franchise those kinds of things but irrespective we have said about change personality of the firm and say okay so what does that mean what that means is we in we altered our incentive plans weve always focused on earnings primarily secondarily on revenue growth in we switched to provide instead of the revenue to focus on deposit growth both volume and cost and that was an important thing to help us beat the drum change the mindset and so forth i think that has ph many implications as to what people worked on their diligence and gathering deposits and so forth i think beyond that we also launched a number of different initiatives some which have some pretty long lead times but we had built a great platform for hsas as an example which we believe is a phenomenal market opportunity for us weve also built capability to bank property managers homeowners associations those sorts of organizations with sort of value added accounting support thats beginning to pay dividends paid dividends in for us weve focused on qualified settlement funds and various other products weve got a product that is focused on captive insurance for middlemarket businesses thats opportunities middle market businesses have and so were finding strong growth there so i dont mean to go on and just give you a feel but i want to put in perspective theres a lot of things going on that are structural in change in the personality of our firm to be a better deposit gathering theres some product capabilities that are beginning to pay dividends and i expect to pay dividends going forward now where we are as you know theres tons of liquidity on our balance sheet that has to do with nothing but ppp and in other words a bunch of money got put on our clients balance sheet as a result of that and then in pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 addition to that a lot of those business clients in this kind of environment build their own liquidity so whatever means of mechanisms they have beyond ppp and so all that stuff going on some of it is a function of whats going on right now tied into covid and some of its a function of the structural changes that were trying to make so ive rambled through all that to get down to this we ought to see a diminishment in this liquidity build our case is we think this economy would begin to reopen in the latter half of this year so you ought to have some diminishment in liquidity thats associated with ppp and other corporate liquidity that weighs on slows the growth it should diminish but we do also have these initiatives that we think are going to continue to pay dividends so again im just trying to give you the puts and takes there brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group yeah thats great color terry and then the other thing i was curious about was just the buyback do you anticipate being active with the buyback this year or is that more of a reup and your stocks obviously a lot higher than it was and if your growth is going to be there then maybe you dont get to use it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well right now the planning assumption is that well use probably of it this year or into the first quarter of next year well obviously use it to defend the stock when we need to and the impact to earnings is not nearly as significant as it would have been otherwise given where the share price is but i think well spend a significant portion of that money at some point during the year brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group okay great very helpful thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brett operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just looking at the second round of ppp you guys are so successful with it in the first round can you give us some help i guess just thinking about the potential size of the second round and then as you are going out and working with your customers on that are you how successful are you i guess targeting those maybe those unrated commercial customers that youre more concerned about earlier on and getting them a second round m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah let me just update you based on this morning were at about almost million in application flow on the second round now more than of that were borrowers that were involved in the first round of ppp last year so if you remember last year we did loans and billion billion in balances we dont anticipate nearly that kind of level were somewhere thinking based on the surveys we did over the last couple of weeks with the prior borrowers that were probably going to be somewhere around maybe almost billion if we can get to that number so thats kind of where were thinking were going to end up at with respect to the second program is that what you were looking for jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thats great and then when you look at where that billion is going and you overlay that with your the credits youre still more concerned about how much penetration do you think youre going to get with those covidsensitive industries or those borrowers that still are struggling a little bit more m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think a lot of those will go to hotels retail restaurants and entertainment for sure but i think this time there will be fewer big dollar kind of loans i think itll be largely to smaller businesses that are trying to get through these next few months jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color and then looking at those hires you did in the year are you seeing or do you anticipate a longer period of time for them to sort of breakeven or be able to ramp up and get their customers in based on covid and when should we think that that really starts contributing to the bottom line m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thats a great question i think generally what our just from feet jared what our plan assumption has always been on the revenue producers that were hiring generally were hiring people that have big books of business and so forth and so depending upon whether youre talking about a middlemarket banker a private banker a broker a mortgage originator and so forth there are some different dynamics in terms of how people get their books moved but generally we expect them to consolidate the vast majority of their book over a three to fouryear period of time call it four years our belief is it generally ought to work that way we generally believe that theyre going to get through breakeven in the first months pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 there may be some slowness in there but its not a lot in other words it does take us as i mentioned earlier it does take us a little longer to recruit somebody and get them in the boat than it did without covid it takes them a little longer to get their book moved than i think it did precovid but i dont mean it like stretched and elongated a year i think it elongated a month or two kind of thing so we dont have dramatically different planning assumptions about how quickly theyll cross breakeven or how quickly theyll consolidate their outlook jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning guys i wonder if we could just start with bhg i was curious about that reserve level have they did they adopt cecl or not yet m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc no they have not adopted cecl i think they are two years out from having to formally adopt cecl so they dont have theyre not ceclcompliant yet brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it so they might have more flex in managing that level okay and on the bank buy rate appreciate that disclosure i had thought that if there was potentially an issue with bhg you might see the bank pull away as soon as covid broke and obviously that didnt happen i was wondering if you had any color about the tick down in the bank buy rate here in the fourth quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think when i talk to the bhg folks and well give an update here in a couple of days the auction platform is very competitive theyve seen numbers where bank yields are getting down into the high because that paper is so attractive to them so yes its a very solid theyve kind of restricted the flow into the auction platform with the buildup of the balance sheet trying to get ready for this next securitization but right now theres a lot of banks after that paper brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay ill follow up more on that offline you mentioned sticking to credit a couple of construction loans were moved to criticized that had just been completed how whats the outlook for those are those just now considered stabilized financing or are you waiting for a thirdparty takeout there pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc not waiting for a thirdparty takeout we did have a few of our construction loans that were modified where we provided a longer interestonly period i would say we moved them into that risk grade category purely just to be consistent with prior quarters we felt like the hospitality industry was such where it was just prudent to move them into criticized brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc but for a loan that was formerly construction you had no theres no issue with it remaining on balance sheet it just remains there at probably reasonably attractive terms timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc correct correct i think there were a couple of those that we as a modification established an interest reserve that they would put on to deposit with pinnacle to kind of help them weather through covid until travel and hotel occupancy rates increased brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it all right thanks for the color m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brock operator our next question comes from michael rose with raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys most my questions have been answered but i want to get some clarification harold on the nii guidance is that inclusive of ppp i think you have like million in just trying to figure out what the base is and then does that include any of the round two that youre talking about if you can just kind of help us on the starting point harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thank you it does include forgiveness of i think ive got million in accretion coming from the ppp program and most of that will happen in but it does not include any kind of income from the second round michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay so it is inclusive of ppp okay thats helpful and then just as i think about the average loan and deposit growth targets that you laid out is that also the full year average for both of those because if i look at the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 average deposit growth i mean it would imply a pretty big reduction in deposits just yearonyear if im looking at the full year average harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc now normally on loan and deposit growth were talking about eop growth so let me know if you have any more issues around that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah okay yeah i can follow up offline okay thats all i had thanks operator the next question comes from the line of catherine mealor with kbw catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good afternoon catherine how are you catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc im good well youve given a lot of ppnr guidance which i think is helpful and i think its clearly showing some upside from where consensus is sitting today so that leaves the provision which i know is a big unknown for everybody and hard to predict but i want to see if you could just as you sit here today and youre thinking about how your borrowers are behaving and what youre seeing in your markets what would be your best guide as to the sense of timing of when well start to see losses flow in and perhaps also your expectation for when we may start to see more we had a little bit of reserve release this quarter but maybe more active reserve release and when those two things may come together thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc catherine ill speak to reserve release and what were kind of thinking about and then ill let tim talk about loss content yeah we think theres probably a high likelihood of reserve release this year and we did a little bit in the first quarter our planning assumption is that well have some this year not a lot but its also pretty i mean you can probably get to a more significant reserve release pretty quickly depending on the success of the rollout and what that does to unemployment by the end of the year so i guess what weve been talking about over the last couple of quarters has been youd see a reserve build we thought reserve would be fairly flat here in the fourth quarter it actually went down a little bit we thought we pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 could see kind of a flattish reserve for the first half of and then start seeing loss content emerge towards the end of the second quarter end of the third quarter and then looking at a bigger reserve release at the end of the year but it looks like on the reserve release side that may be happening a little quicker than we had originally thought that makes sense catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc it does and is unemployment the biggest piece thats driving that or how much of it is also being driven by your specific credits m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc as far as the ratio of allowance to loans not the absolute level of the allowance charge off experience which has been relatively benign so far as well as any kind of nonperforming past dues nonperformance chargeoffs all influence reserve but youre right the biggest influencer thats in basically every model every credit model that were using for cecl is the biggest macro influencer would be unemployment the forecast catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then ph just on timing of losses timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc catherine this is tim catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey tim timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc i would tell you that certainly the rollout of the vaccine and the fiscal stimulus will help i think to the extent that weve got a very successful ppp loan program again that will serve as a mitigant my intuition and anecdotal since the losses going into will be similar probably a little bit higher first and second quarter not a dramatic change but maybe a slight uptick catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator our next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery your line is now open pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian how you doing brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good hey harold just back to your question on the or the last question on the reserve i mean just can you kind of put a range around as you kind of get through and get more comfortable with credit continue to see that happen kind of where that postcovid reserve to loan i guess if thats youre looking at the reserve to loan ratio kind of might range to or maybe a range of where you think of that ends up harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well were not thinking anything around the terms of where it was precovid so we were down into that 60basispoint in that number i really dont know how deep it can go its very difficult to forecast these credit models into the future like to try to peg what our number might be at the end of this year given a certain unemployment forecast so theres a whole lot of guesswork going on it just seems like the trends are with respect to loss content nonperformance and the like that well see some decrease sidebar and will get you a cup of coffee at starbucks i think itll be an interesting conversation over the course of the year for not only us but all banks as we start seeing reserve releases and when the regulators show up regarding that so i dont think youll see us get us anywhere near what we had precovid but we should see some meaningful reductions in our reserves because we had significant build over the course of last year and we really dont think well see that loss content material brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thats helpful harold and just the can you just kind of comment a little bit on the pace of reduction in the wholesale fundings and kind of the size of the balance sheet as you go for a haircut timing of that and then maybe just kind of the influence on the margin and the kind of the core margin harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah weve got i think that theres a slide in the deck a chart in the deck thats talk about like billion in wholesale funding most of that is in broker deposits that we fully intend to redeem i think the average yield on those things is already on those things is somewhere around or basis points so that will have a positive influence on our margins or deposit pricing so on and so forth in the third and fourth quarter we dont have a whole lot of opportunities for wholesale reductions ill say that kind of optimistically by the time we get to that part of the year perhaps some prepayment penalties related to federal home loan bank borrowings that will come down and so we may reevaluate prepayments on federal home loan bank borrowings ive got about billion of that left on my balance sheet as i said earlier the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 prepayment penalties on that today is just a little bit rich for our appetite so but we may reevaluate that towards the end of the year brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then maybe just one for tim just tim i guess i know you said that criticized maybe went up a touch this quarter i guess would your anticipation be that were at a peak on the criticized levels now based on kind of the outlook for credit timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc i do i think there could be a little bit more migration but i do a lot of our criticized as you know with the hotel book and we pore over that every quarter and i describe that criticized level as very stable we think it will take some time to migrate back into past grade just given the depths of what happened in the hospitality industry but my own intuition or gut based on these indepth quarterly reviews i feel like thats about peaked brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thanks for taking the questions guys nice
