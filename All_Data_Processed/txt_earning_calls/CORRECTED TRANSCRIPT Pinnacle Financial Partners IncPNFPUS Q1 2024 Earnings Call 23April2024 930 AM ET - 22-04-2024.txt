director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you paul and thank all of you for joining us here this morning most of you have been during these calls and so were going to begin every one of these calls with the shareholder value dashboard these metrics are really our north star there are a lot of interesting things that can be talked about obviously harold will talk about more things in more detail here in just a few minutes but ultimately were here to produce shareholder value and this is how we think you do it overtime looking at the gaap measure first and then the adjusted numbers which really better reflect how we run the business at a glance you can see that we continue to grow revenue more rapidly and reliably than peers and we continue to grow our balance sheet volumes more rapidly and reliably with payers which is the view of our future revenue growth and then we relentlessly focus on compounding tangible book value and then across the bottom now the key asset quality metrics we focus on reflected both fraud loan formation and losses in general those metrics continue to be among the best in the peer group and as you can see compare favorably to our longerterm historical averages but that said during the quarter we increased our allowance for credit pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 losses on loans from to primarily as a result of a further deterioration in a previously disclosed problem borrower and to provide additional protection given a higher broader rate scenario so from feet this quarter weve got the reserve build on one side largely being offset by the recognition of a commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower expenses in the form of reduction in associate incentives nevertheless for me theres a lot to celebrate here particularly in terms of revenue growth with growth in both noninterest income and net interest income doubledigit core deposit growth and even net growth in noninterest bearing deposits so with that harold lets take a more indepth look at the quarter harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody another strong quarter of deposit growth we were also pleased with how our noninterestbearing deposits performed in the quarter giving us additional optimism about where those balances likely end for the year as to deposit growth still believe we can grow deposits than the previous range of highsingle to low doubledigits this year obviously the latest fomc meeting will impact our rate projections for the remainder of the year as a result weve taken more time looking at the back book on deposits two years ago of our nmas had rates less than today only of our rate is less than also today of our money markets are at rates greater than so we feel that our deposits are priced very competitively we have made some preemptive strikes here late in the quarter successfully reducing some of our more expensive accounts as well as a deep dive on our pool of reciprocal deposits this effort is helpful to our outlook as we enter the second quarter after new accounts added to our lenders in the first quarter the average onboarding rate was around as weve said we like our position as to deposit rates in our markets so for us deposit rates will likely be more like a slow creep from here not any sort of rapid increase ive listened to a few conference calls of late particularly the large cap so some believe theyve acknowledged outsized deposit spread and are letting people know that benefit may be going away in the near future that said we believe as we head into the second quarter deposit rates for us may increase a few basis points but it wont be a lot loan payments slightly less than we anticipated we did have some large payoffs late in the quarter which impacted our eop balances still feel like we will be outside of loan growers for the year call it to growth still believe that we are doing a good job on spreads particularly for prime and sofr price credit and fixed rate spreads continue to come along nicely one of the keys to our financial plan is repricing our fixed rate loans were expecting about billion in cash flows from our fixed rate loan book which are scheduled to come in over the remainder of with call it an average yield around as to renewals and new fixed rate loans originated in the first quarter we averaged around with a target of to i think our rms are doing a great job here and are looking forward to seeing what happens in the second quarter as it is the most important quarter as far as net interest income growth for is concerned given we have a lot of opportunity to influence the success of this initiative in the second quarter our loan growth pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 targets which we feel good about coupled with our efforts on fixed rate repricing will go a long way to hitting our net interest income outlook for the year we did see some contraction in the margin this quarter at after two quarters of we said last time that we were optimistic that we would see nim expansion in we feel confident that we will see margin expansion happen in the second quarter we modified our interest rate forecast from times to times and with the two not happening until later in the year one in september and one in november that said given the volatility of the data we could decide that no rate cuts will happen this year as the trends seem to point to fewer at this point we feel like the no rate cut scenario on the short end of the curve is likely neutral to our current outlook as we move through the year as you might expect we just would like to see the intermediate part of the curve continue to steepen so at march you might ask is pnfp assetsensitive or liabilitysensitive considering our tactical balance sheet modeling as well as how we think our rms and their clients typically respond to these sort of environments where net interest income initially higherforlonger is probably helpful but longerterm deposit rates will likely lull somewhat and potentially squeeze the margin over time as for credit were again presenting our traditional credit metrics we mentioned one nonperforming credit in the fourth quarter press release that weakened further during the first quarter as we noted above this credit contributed to the basis point increase in our allowance this quarter this loan started out in as a million loan to borrower that leases highly specialized healthcare facilities to operators in various states we did record a partial charge off of million relating to this credit in the first quarter the operators of the borrowers buildings were impacted by covid as operators were unable to collect sufficient and timely reimbursement which was mainly to recover the incremental cost of inflation for their clients and patients as a result the operators incurred revenue shortfalls skilled labor lab census went down et cetera our borrower is cooperative that is helping facilitate resolution which could take a few quarters this is one where the lesson learned is a hard film as well much reliance on the wisdom of the management team that we have made for many years the management team had executed a similar business model before and done it successfully and was experienced in the very specific corners of the healthcare industry we will work to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and minimize loss to our firm the buildings are in good markets or and are in attractive areas in those markets so given all the above were anticipating a net chargeoff rate of basis points to basis points for inclusive of the loan i mentioned previously currently we have no reason to believe that our allowance of capital increase from here so we are flattish on the reserve for the rest of more about commercial real estate and just so you know weve added some more information on the credit primarily for cre and construction in the supplemental deck our cre construction portfolio continues to perform very well as you might expect our credit officers continue to pay particular attention to our multifamily hospitality and office portfolios we continue to push for lower exposure in construction our target of of total riskbased capital we believe can be achieved before yearend our appetite is noted by the almost solid red table on the bottom right is largely unchanged and we dont anticipate any change as to appetite in even when we go below we continue to be somewhat interested in the high quality real estate primarily warehouse and some multifamily but let me stress any new pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 commitments to this space are limited to strategic client relationships only and no way should anyone perceive were on any sort of offense here as to the impact of higherforlonger lots of discussion around liquidity and takeout availability in the institutional cre space we would agree that liquidity is tight for say downtown multitenant office power center retail high end hospitality and other specific segments where covid and now inflation has been very impactful we just dont have much if any exposure to these segments for our segments we like other banks are seeing our institutional borrowers delay decisioning regarding any sort of exit from these projects whether it be marketing for sale or securing a permanent loan i know theres a lot of noise out there that lenders are panicked and borrowers are desperate to get out of these construction projects not so for the property type pnfp has long supported there remains ample liquidity which recently appears to be getting somewhat more attractive to our borrowers specifically take out from life insurance companies and the agency lenders fannie mae and freddie mac these capital sources are generally more favorably priced than our bank debt usually by to in most cases were seeing 10year terms from insurance firms and agencies in the range versus bank rates call it between and the cmbs market is also available however our borrowers are typically not big fans given the inherent inflexibility of the cmbs debt structure3 all in for now many borrowers are likely to remain with banks by executing the embedded extension options in our original construction loan contracts rightsizing the outstanding balance if necessary and thus waiting for a better rate environment to sell or refinance again some select information on cre credit and various asset quality measurements we have added some ltv information to this slide our ltvs we believe are solid and as the chart indicates with lots of room for valuation adjustments should the markets require we have also analyzed recent loan renewals for nonowner occupied commercial real estate with principal balances greater than million and have seen some modest declines in ltv for these credits the worst was a million office loan where the ltv went from in january that was before the start of covid and before work from home with the thing to now currently an reduction but still very comfortable at the best result was longer term an million hotel loan that moved from an ltv of to now both of these loans are performing and we have no reason to believe theres any issues with them we have experienced some increase in credit metrics and classified assets and npls from a year ago but these levels remain enviable in our humble opinion additionally as to our market data our occupancy levels remain strong and rental rates have experienced several years of increases which has served to strengthen our sponsors some of that information is also in the supplemental today now on to page and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding bhg and various other non recurring items fee revenues were up linkedquarter were pleased to report that our wealth management units had a strong first quarter and fully expect the efforts of our wealth management professionals will continue in the remainder of the boli work we did last quarter is performing as planned so expect to see incremental revenue from that work some in the second quarter but also into the third quarter asset mortgage servicing rights asset that terry mentioned earlier we elected to record it this quarter we have been serving freddie mac sbl loans since we merged with magna bank in memphis several years ago sbl is the small business lending program that freddie mac offers its really the standard for agencybacked small apartment financing with loan amounts of pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 million to million pnfp originates the loan for freddie who purchases the loan with pnfp retaining the servicing over the years and as we do each year we perform strategic assessments on various business lines to determine strategic fit growth potential cultural alignment so on and so forth as rates escalated the value of the servicing right increased especially over the last several quarters weve also increased the volume of loans being serviced in that unit in recent years in light of that we obtained a third party appraisal to determine the value at million which we will now need to revalue every quarter all in we are raising guidance for fee revenues this year primarily driven by the growth in our primary fee businesses a range of to seems reasonable given the performance of several of our primary business lines in the first quarter first quarter expenses came in slightly less than we anticipated after backing out the fdic special assessment we like everyone else recorded the fdic special assessment accrual of million in additional expense in the first quarter importantly weve lowered our incentive target from to payout for fiscal year to now here at the end of the first quarter obviously our goal is to bring it back to target this year but that cant happen unless we feel like were going to achieve our financial targets in the end the relationship we created since we started the firm between our financial performance and our incentive plan works is intentional and helps ensure that we dont sacrifice wanting to benefit the other we have elected to keep our expense outlook unchanged to million to million for the year you might ask why that lowered more we have some reasonably that we can fight our way back into this so we hope to give back to some give back some of the incentive we eliminated in the first quarter but we also have other ways to manage our cost and we will deploy those as consider necessary we believe our overall expense outlook for is largely intact so were going to keep it consistent for that now to the bhg as the slide indicates origination trends were down in the first quarter given the tighter credit box and the impact of the macro interest rate environment last quarter we had anticipated a flattish year as to production bhg believes that our production target is still in range but a higherforlonger rate environment could impact those assumptions as to placements it was again a very strong quarter for sales into the bank network and they also closed on their ninth securitization for million and as we mentioned in the press release last night with a net spread of greater than which we were all very excited to see also my understanding is that over firm participated in the issuance thus great demand for bhg paper also keep in mind the securitization added more than million in provision expense to the first quarter results bhg doesnt anticipate another abs issuance until probably the fourth quarter of this year as for spreads auction platform spreads it widened during the first quarter today totaling while the balance sheet spreads are fairly consistent with prior quarter all in bhg believes spreads are holding in this rate environment bhg believes when rate decreases start that will be a good thing for them not only from a volume perspective but also from a spread perspective on reserves and theres a lot of information on this slide bhg did increase reserves during the first quarter for both on and offbalance sheet loans modest uptick in the first quarter for credit losses for the offbalance sheet business going from to on balance sheet was a but the news is good as it pertains to bhgs credit experience we have been anticipating for at least a year or more that the first half of was critical to our assumptions around credit improving even though the chargeoff rates for all balance sheet increased during the first quarter the actual dollar value of chargeoffs for all balance sheet decreased along with average balances thats why the charge off rate increased because the average balances went down even though the charge off rate for both on and off balance sheet was up in the first quarter bhg believes that they may have pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 turned the corner on tackling the covid overhang of great inflation in and as the bottom left chart indicates ph flat delinquencies which are past dues greater than days for all of bhgs loans both on and off balance sheet appear to have topped off over the last few months and are bending down at the end of the first quarter especially in consumer credit also bhg believes based on information gathered from the rating agency their loss experience thus far postcovid will be better than that of other fintech competitors again as the past due chart indicates the consumer loan is very encouraging its too early to declare victory but bhg has worked tirelessly to get back to their precovid credit environment more progress to come over the next few quarters as to origination and earnings achieving the same level of originations as last year will take great effort that said bhg is not and i emphasis on not interested in adjusting their credit models to achieve volume goals suffice it to say as to placing bhg originated credit the appetite for bhgs credit is as strong as ever that in and of itself should help spreads going forward as to earnings bhg is holding to their midsingle digit earnings growth target for this year additionally bhg has tactics they can deploy to help their bottom line and increase potential earnings the important assumption for bhg this year is what happens with credit if improvement continues like we believe it will bhg will have an impressive year with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks harold in general it seems to me that the operating environment for banks is both difficult and volatile inflation appears to be more difficult to tame than predict it even as recently as several weeks ago by jerome powell it seems to me that rates are now more likely to stay higherforlonger resulting in an inverted yield curve for longer and with all the uncertainty and rapidly changing market conditions bank stock investors are obviously finding it challenging to forecast bank earnings and discern the dependable creators and so in my opinion in this environment a company to pnfp that over the longer term has been able to generate such reliable growth should be an attractive alternative weve built a truly differentiated model that attracts the industrys best talents like none of its competitors and great raving fans like none of its competitors which results in persistent growth of clients and therefore persistent growth in loans deposits and net interest income over the long haul its how we consistently grew our eps over the last decade without having to take on many of the risks that some of our some in our industry have taken which almost always come home to roost in times of volatility in fact we produce the highest total shareholder return among our peers over the last decade a decade that witnessed a great deal of volatility over the decade i watched bank management taking extraordinary risk and investor themes change with every swing in market conditions during the pandemic slow growth and no growth banks came in favor and we saw pes for banks with net negative balance sheet growth at least significantly higher than for the growth banks during the liquidity crisis we saw valuations pickup for the money center banks on one end and slow growth rural markets on the other versus high growth regions like pnfp during the fed tightening cycle we saw low deposit by the banks highly rewarded while high paying banks like pnfp were achieved but through all of that at pinnacle we simply focused on rapidly and reliably growing our earnings stream not values not margins or trending edges earnings our approach at pinnacle reminds me of the old john houseman commercials for smith barney where he said they make money in the oldfashioned way they earn it during the last decade our price the next months eps contracted meaningfully so then it becomes obvious that it was our ability to drive and grow earnings that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 accounted for our peer leading total shareholder return and not any pickup in the multiple that investors were signed in based on their most recent thesis and so let me be clear at pnfp our focus is primarily on sustainable longterm growth in earnings and tangible book value and im not saying that deposit cost bases are of no importance im not saying it is meritless to screen for nims or roas or efficiency ratios im just saying at pinnacle our principal objective is sustainably compounding earnings and compounded tangible book value so we could slow hiring reduce noninterest expense and improve our shortterm earnings we could concentrate on lowering our deposit base instead of funding a high growth balance sheet and forego the once in a generation opportunity we have to continue taking market share from all our competitors but instead our focus is on sustainable growth in earnings and compounding tangible book value and if we focus on sustainable earnings growth and compounded tangible book value there is no chance youre going to take a temporary influx of liquidity based on government stimulus and put it in securities due to short term earnings at the time when interest rates are near alltime lows and you cant accept the duration risk of lowering the balance sheet with unhedged longterm fixed rate mortgages when yields are at alltime lows you just accept the lower net interest margin in order to protect hard earned tangible book value thats your focus you protect loss absorbing capital there are banks that win best when rates are falling and there are banks that win best when rates are rising and there are banks that have really low average deposit balances all of which have garnered lofty multiples at one time or another over the last decade but in the banking business perhaps the only way to consistently and reliably produce total shareholder returns better than peers over the longhaul because they have a sustainable competitive advantage a differentiated model and thats what i believe we have at pinnacle this is the market tracking data from greenwich associates or coalition greenwich as they refer to themselves now the data for businesses with annual revenues from million to million in our market area which for these purposes is defined as tennessee north carolina south carolina washington dc and atlanta georgia it compares the top banks in the footprint more specifically in addition to pinnacle the top banks in that footprint include truist bank of america wells fargo 1st citizens bank trust pnc first horizon jpmorgan regions and southstate looking at client satisfaction on the left of the slide the crosshairs are set at the mean for the market penetration on the yaxis and the percentage of excellent client satisfaction ratings on the xaxis so the banks in the top left quadrant are the large share banks with the lowest level of client satisfaction as what we refer to as vulnerable competitors banks in the lower right quadrant are the bank providing the highest level of client satisfaction theoretically the market share takers and as you can see pnfp provides the single highest level of client satisfaction in our footprint that differentiation and a particularly wide differentiation when compared to the largest most vulnerable banks in the market and on the right side of the slide you can see that the banks at the top with the highest overall client satisfaction are generally the market share takers those are the banks with the improving market penetration over the last year as shown in the right most column and the banks at the bottom of the list are the lowest client satisfaction banks and their rd give it up market share penetration honestly more important than client satisfaction scores is the net promoter score satisfied clients are many times leave if they get a better offer while net promoters are substantially less likely to leave because theyre pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 emotionally engaged with the brand not surprisingly pnfp has the highest level of net promoters not by a little bit but by a lot and not only do we have far and away the highest percentage of promoters but the greenwich survey data found no detractors literally zero indiscernible study this comparison of the top banks in the southeastern footprint our sustainable competitive advantages begin to crystalize its no secret that for relationship management relationship managed banks like us the quality the relationship managers must be the principal differentiator greenwich has identified seven important metrics that are valued by business class you see them listed in the first column there in the right most column you see the peer comparison ratings for the same competitors in our footprint that i just walked through the blue bars represent the range of scores for that set of banks on that metric the white line is the median score and the white circle is the pinnacle score for that metric that being seen the pnfp is the market leader for every single relationship management metric think about that in terms of a sustainable competitive advantage not only are we widely viewed to be the most prolific hirer of relationship managers in our footprint but the quality of those weve attracted are literally the best in the market and as the slide progression i want to make this point when we provide our outlook for loan growth as an example which is substantially higher than peers some might fear that the risk profile is elevated as a result of the high growth in loans but hopefully as you think about the fact that were not only hiring the most relationship managers in our footprint which explains the high growth but were hiring the best relationship managers in our footprint which in my judgment should produce a lower risk profile not a higher risk much has been said and written about the advantages that the large money center banks have as a result of their technology budgets and there is no doubt that every money center takes them with substantially swamp hour but using the similar graphic for and regarding treasury management and the digital experience for the top banks in our footprint again you see that pinnacle actually have the single best perception among businesses surveyed by greenwich in our footprint both in terms of capability and delivery this is one of the clearest examples of how we combine the tech and touch to create this sustainable competitive advantage and ultimately there is no more powerful brand among businesses in our footprint in pinnacles greenwich has identified five pillars of brand perceptions among businesses and as you can see the range of scores for the top banks in our footprint is pretty wide but again pinnacle is the leader on every single pillar and so as you think about sustainable competitive advantage its highly unlikely that competitors can easily address their market perceptions for how easy they are to do business with how trustworthy they are or whether they value longterm relationships and so forth even if they recognize these substantial deficiencies and even if they have the will to change and even if theyre successful in addressing all the root causes of why theyre so hard to do business with and why theyre not trusted and why theyre viewed to not value longterm relationships those reputations in customers are more likely built over decades and so attempting to connect the dots for you on exactly why weve been able to gather clients faster than competitors why weve grown our interest earning assets faster than peers and therefore our net interest income faster than peers and therefore our eps faster than peers over the last decade is because of the very hard work weve done to build the kind of work environment that attracts not only the most but the best talent in the industry and to create a demonstrably differentiated level of service thats why substantially less clients can see any vulnerability in their relationship with us and substantially more clients and tend to reward us with more business over the next to months by far than for any of our competitors pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 thats the linkage from the work environment which was recently running by forbes magazine as the 11th best in all the united states to the recruiting effectiveness to the client experience to the volume clients indiscernible and all of this bears on our outlook for the remainder of and for the next decade for that matter so harold let me turn it over to you harold r carpenter executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry and now on the slide on our outlook for weve tightened our expectations in some cases and modified others in the end weve concluded that our overall outlook for is basically consistent with last quarter ive listened to a few conference calls this quarter theres a lot of chatter around world events inflation ma politics so on and so forth and how those events are impacting their outlooks for and for me i find myself thinking a lot about interest rates and credit i have a lot of confidence in where our balance sheet sits with respect to both ive mentioned to a few of my cfo friends over the last few years how i was a bit envious of their asset sensitivity our goal is and have been managing our balance sheet with an aim towards interest rate risk neutrality we may drift slightly to either asset or liability sensitivity from time to time but in the end our belief is that we let the client gathering engine to see what drives our earnings growth as to credit ive personally spent a lot of time with our credit team also spent a lot of time with indiscernible in recent quarters particularly our real estate lenders are likely will spend even more time with all of them for the rest of this year to try to better understand what happen to credit when rates go up or go down as i should and as you would expect for what its worth our folks are at the line of scrimmage actively working with our borrowers every day ensuring we deliver great service and protect the financial soundness of this firm because of that i feel good about where we are where were headed in and what we all hope will shape up to be even after you consider what we know today about world events inflation so on and so forth so with that paul the group i know is thankful that i am done and if you would lets open it up for qa pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions and the first question today is coming from casey haire from jefferies casey your line is live casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone quick question question on the i guess the nim outlook you guys mentioned that its you expect it up in the second quarter and costs are down relative to the first quarter but the some of the yields the loan yield spot yields are lower than where they were in the first quarter and then the muni bond yields were also lower just trying to get a sense of whats going on on the yield side harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well casey this is harold i think the muni bond yields theres a volume issue there but i think we should see some of that recover here in the second quarter the deposit rate forecast i think will be just a small increase whats really dependent on our nim forecast is how well we do on fixed rate loan repricing and whether our dda accounts hang in there like we think theyll hang in there so if those two things happen we think our nim forecast is solid obviously loan growth is an important element to all that and so we still feel pretty good about the to loan growth for the year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and then i guess just switching to the bhg outlook the guide implies a pretty steep ramp in the remaining quarters here harold you mentioned credit as a pretty significant wild card just wondering what does that how do you get bhg run rate up to that sort of mid million level to hit that guide is it credit or is it more originations just some color there harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we think originations are going to be probably a little better here for the rest of the year what impacted the first quarter a lot was the abs placement i dont think theyre going to spend as much time working on balance sheet kind of growth and theyll spend more time on the gain on sale part but youre right the credit is the issue were all optimistic to see those bars turns out and they feel pretty good about where they are right now casey haire q analyst jefferies llc very good thank you harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc sure pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 operator thank you the next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc harold maybe just start to go back to the question casey just asked when i look at the margin its pretty flat earning asset yields are pretty flat ph deposit growth are pretty flat this quarter its not really clear to me whats driving the expectation for nim expansion in the second quarter harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right well like i said weve got a lot more fixed rate loans to reprice this quarter we think also the work we did at the end of the quarter on some deposits preemptive strikes into the deposit book should also be helpful so those are that indiscernible balances hanging in there are the primary kind of tailwind to the margin uplift steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay so youre expecting earning asset yield to pick up a bit in and deposit cost to come down a bit is that what youre saying harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then on the expense side we know you guys took the incentive comp down to of target but kept the full year expense outlook intact can you just run through a little more detail whats expected to fill that bucket up ph why were still the same expense outlook harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right so what we elected to do is not take it down so were going to keep it the same we felt like as that played into our overall outlook for that was the fair thing to do if the incentive accrual gets reapplied so we add back the call it the million bucks into the incentive accrual for the year that will come out obviously with pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 revenue increases but we have other opportunities to manage our expense outlook to kind of keep that still within that million to million if that makes sense steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay yeah yeah that makes sense i guess the one wildcard with the new hiring was really solid sort of new hires what is embedded in the expense outlook or is this going to be a much stronger year than typical for hiring just given the pipeline harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think we put in the as far as the plan for this year basically the same hiring profile for as ill have to go back and look at my numbers but i think overall head count was up people or so last year something like that so steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc theyre similar harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc that includes revenue producers and everybody steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes yes harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc there was or something like that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes yes okay harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 indiscernible the revenue producer plan was basically the same this year as it was what we did last year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for all the color operator thank you the next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw catherine your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey catherin catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one more on the margin ph so good morning one more on the margin harold so you mentioned that even in a no rate cut scenario the neutral to your outlook on your nii guide how should we think about the risk the downside risk to growth if we dont see rate cut later on this year harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question catherine i think it will impact growth maybe to the low end of our number but at the same time a lot of our growth if you look theres a chart in the back that shows where our loan growth came in the first quarter and it all came from new markets new people and so thats what were leaning into as far as our basically our loan growth for the whole year were not expecting any significant growth call it it does not go overall we might be looking in the legacy markets for call it to so that chart in the back would show that we didnt have hardly any growth but we had negative growth in the legacy markets in the first quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then similarly on the margin in a scenario where we dont have cuts do you feel like theres enough momentum in dda balances holding in and youve got better fixed rate loan rate repricing for the back half of the year that the margin continues to expand throughout the rest of the year with cuts or even without cuts harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were keeping our fingers crossed on that for sure right now our average dda balances as far as individual accounts are pretty consistent with precovid there might be a little excess there that we need to worry about but so far so good with respect to that but thats a real important kind of component to the overall kind of net interest income plan for the year pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc for sure okay great thanks and perhaps one just really small question if you dont mind service charges were a lot higher this quarter any color on whats going on there is that a good run rate to grow from harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think theres anything specific that we can talk about maybe terry has got some ideas here but i think we did do some kind of like everybody looking at indiscernible looking at the fee waivers looking at things like that where weve over the years kind of just gotten into maybe some places with certain class where we need to kind of go readdress some of those charges but i dont think we did any kind of m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah there were no universal price changes there were some initiatives that were aimed at review in longterm waivers longterm special pricing those kinds of things that i think it made a difference catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great great thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from brandon king from truist securities brandon your line is live brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so just to run out the deposit cost ph question i think ive heard ph mixed things so are you expecting interestbearing deposit costs to incrementally creep a little higher from here is that correct harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think they will creep but it will be basis points to basis points i dont think it will be any more than that i think our group is doing a good job of holding the line on deposit cost so long as our core deposit kind of growth continues i think that will be accurate if for some reason core deposit growth doesnt happen ph the way the wholesale market that money is that money is really expensive and were hoping not to do that so so far so good pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then harold in your prepared remarks you mentioned that there could be other ways to manage costs besides the incentive accrual so do you care to go into more details about what could potentially be done on that front harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc oh yeah well we could always delay hiring for all practical purposes our hiring plan for support units is really restricted right now not to put a damper on the call but we can do that we can delay hiring weve indiscernible to start this year we could delay those theres several things that we can do in order to kind of bring the expense number back in line if we need to brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay and then just lastly on boli came in around million in the quarter i think you mentioned that you could see some incremental revenue from that so should we expect that kind of million figure to increase incrementally or should that normalize to a small amount harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think probably call it million is probably a fair number to think about going forward there were some death benefits in the first quarter but yeah i think somewhere call it millionish is probably a fair number for both brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brandon operator thank you the next question will be from stephen scouten from piper sandler stephen your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks good morning i guess one of my first question here was just curious around customer kind of appetite for the higher fixed rate loan yields today versus maybe last quarter or previous do you feel like customers are becoming more maybe acclimated with this rate environment and youre not getting as much pushback or kind of what are the dynamics there as you reprice these loans m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 i think it is fair that there is more acclimation on the clients part to higher fixed rate quote so thats a true statement but i wouldnt wont act like its easy i mean its a dogfight for sure but i think during the quarter our repricing was it the target is at to so were within striking distance and its way up from where it was so again i dont want to act like its easy its not easy but we are getting it done and i think its the combination of the clients acclimation to the rate i think some of the distinctive service levels and so forth the client loyalty is an important variable in there as well stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah that makes sense and i would think i mean the renewal spreads look like they continue to widen a bit and is that largely a function of just the kind of vintage originations being the lowest yielding fixed rate loans that remain on the books harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think stephen i dont know if i got all the question but theres a chart thats on the loan slide that first bar is the biggest as far as rates i think it came in like is what the kind of the is what the renewal rate is coming into the second quarter and the reason is that is probably at the tail end of where before rates started coming down back a few years ago so thats why that line on that chart is ph higher than and then it drops pretty meaningfully down into the down into the over the rest of this year does that make sense stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yes thats perfect thanks for pointing that out and then just last thing for me i know there were times in the past years when you guys have done a really good job of having floors in place before rates went down and taking them off with rates coming higher do you have any meaningful floors in the portfolio today or is that has that been a part of the pricing conversation at this point in time harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah weve got floors in place and weve got some balance sheet floors i think weve got billion to billion in covering some of the floating rate credit but largely weve encouraged floors at the line of scrimmage into individual loan contracts i dont have the number as to what that is today but ill dig it out and ill get it to you stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks for the time today appreciate it harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator thank you the next question will be from michael rose from raymond james michael your line is live pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions harold i know you guys have a pretty robust assumption for deposit betas on the way down is there been any change of that and what is the kind of swing factor there if we dont get any cuts this year as it relates to kind of the nii guide thanks harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think on the short end i dont think theres a whole lot of change in our nii guide today michael we still plan on and our relationship managers are well aware and theyve been informing their clients that when rates do come down we will be aggressive on the downside i think weve gone back and looked at what our beta was on the way up on our negotiated rates it was like or somewhere in that range so we intend to be aggressive on the way down i think the critical question is around what happens if rates dont move from here again i think on the short end and also for the near term we feel like its fairly neutral michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just on the deposit growth you guys have done a great job over a very long period of time growing deposits can you just talk about the complexion of the growth maybe how much will come from some of the more expansionary markets that might be higher cost than mature just given maybe some introductory or teaser rates as you build out those markets versus what youre expecting in the legacy markets and how that could from a yield or from a cost perspective how that could be a swing factor if we are higherforlonger thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah michael i think when we look at the deposit growth that really we generated for the better part of last year and our outlook for the biggest single component of that deposit growth is the deposit specialties that weve developed over the last several years and i wont go through or bore you with all those things but i think ph you maybe youve heard us talk about deposit products that we have for escrow accounting deposit products that we have for captive insurance businesses deposit products that we have for bankruptcy trustees i mean there are a variety of these specialties that weve focused on and built over the last several years really trying to make sure we add some value add for particularly large pools of money and so weve developed a mechanism where weve got market champions in every market for all those products and theres a lot of energy on targeted calling on clients that utilize those particular products and so in all honesty i think the biggest piece of the growth comes from what were able to produce ph with these deposit specialty there is no doubt were also benefited by what goes on in our market extensions as youre growing off a base of zero so all the numbers look pretty good there but as it relates to teaser rates and so forth id just like to keep in mind were not those strategies are not retail in any way shape or form so were not doing rate promotions or any of that kind of thing theres no doubt youre moving market share youre generally not going to convince client to move from where they are to here and pay them a lot less than what theyre getting paid so again i dont mean to act like theres no price pressure there certainly is but again its not a ph retail teaser rate kind of strategy but again id point you back to the deposit specialties pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc no i appreciate the context and maybe just last one for me i know you had two credits that have drove a little bit of an increase in npls obviously very low level you built the reserves can you just help us get comfortable i know theres been a lot written about multifamily supply coming online in some of your markets particularly nashville and down to atlanta is being some of the highest just as it relates to kind of your specific reserves against commercial real estate i think theyre sub for the last call record so can you just help us get comfortable that you guys are kind of well reserved and youll see migration but you arent overly worried about credit thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the what were leaning into is probably one of the well it is almost high performing segment in my loan portfolio is my commercial real estate side and thats been true for many many many years where we get choppy is in the ci book when things happen so i think it has to do with just looking at the macro environment where we are with these loan to values and our multifamily book we think is as strong as its ever been our rental rates are at loan to values in the range i think its by and large on the macro side is where we get it i think where else id get comfort is when i interview my real estate lenders and my credit officers theyre able to talk in very granular granular way about all these multifamily projects and sponsors so i believe were on them and i think we understand what the markets are i dont think we have any significant appetite at all for multifamily right now i think we believe that we like our book and we like our sponsors michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks for taking all my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks michael operator thank you the next question is coming from timur braziler from wells fargo timur your line is live timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc i wanted to follow up on expenses the incentive kind of accrual rate right now is that based on the guidance that youre giving like you said you have to you can work your way back to kind of hitting those numbers i guess what is the expectation for performance needed to hit that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah im not going to get into actual eps targets what it takes to get to kind of ph award you can look at the proxy and see how it works over time and the tearing and how the revenue component flows through it and all that but basically we have to reconcile where we think were going to be for the year to what were going to accrue in that incentive bucket every quarter and thats not only true for cash but also for equity so we have to go through a process to try to make sure we rightsize that accrual every quarter to where we think maturing is with the plan for the year i dont know if that gets at your question generally but maybe ill follow up maybe i can help you out timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah i guess its relative to the guidance if you hit your guidance does that equal on the incentive or is there upside to that number if the guidance is ph hit downside to that number if the guidance is hit i guess is that relative to your broader guidance m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah it is the outlook would give us a range of results for the year and thats kind of like where we believe its going to end up within that range timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then maybe on the loan book m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc im sorry go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no no go ahead finish your thought m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc no no im good please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess on the loan book just looking at linkedquarter construction loans that reduction there in your broader commentary around where you want to get that as a percentage of capital i guess what does the contractual funding look like in the construction book ph has lot of that already taken place from originations booked in prior years or is that comment on working that down on a relative basis to capital more so just the other segments growing faster than the construction bucket pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well we went effectively we went pencils down on construction about a year maybe ph years ago so new commitments we limited to already kind of a to developer sponsors that we had already previously committed so were still funding up on some of those commitments but as it turned out now the funding on these older projects is not keeping up with the projects that are getting their certificate of occupancy so once they get that certificate of occupancy they move out of construction and they either go to the private market they either get paid off or the project gets sold or we move it into commercial real estate so we anticipate that over the rest of the year that will still happen that our funding for new construction will not be as not be large enough to meet that we will still go down on that towards that based on actual fundings and then projects as they complete will move out of that construction bucket timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thanks for the questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc sure operator thank you the next question will come from brett rabatin from hovde group brett your line is live brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning i wanted to start with m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc i wanted to start with the hires and i know that you doubled the jacksonville team already im curious where what geographies youre more interested in growing from here and if anything thats going on with interest rates or higher rates for longer maybe that slows some of your projects are there any new markets on the table at this point m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc so brett i think in terms of hiring jacksonville obviously is a key area of hiring as are the other newer markets specifically dc atlanta and so forth so there is incremental hiring all over the footprint i would say its a pretty good time for us to be attracting talent universally but clearly theres a concentration in the newer markets which is where the hiring is currently occurring pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 and then i guess as it relates to new markets i know youve heard me say this before we love the southeastern markets all the large urban markets in the southeast the principal voids are in florida but the catalyst for when we go is when theres availability of a team that we feel like can build us a big bank and so that was the catalyst for why we went to jacksonville when we did we had a fabulous leadership team that i think is really extraordinary and were going to build something special there and we may find our way to other markets when that same phenomenon occurs but were not trying to get other markets were not working on how to get out of the markets and so forth so i hope im addressing what you asked brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc yeah thats helpful terry and then the other quick question was around slide where you have the customer penetration and the overall satisfaction levels and im curious if i get that the national banks are the higher customer penetration levels but is that an area of opportunity for you either clientbyclient or product set to grow the penetration on your clients m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc absolutely thats really the whole point to me brett is across that whole footprint we have markets we dominate like a national but across the whole footprint were in some really hands of markets where were a low share player and so as i look at that chart what id say is okay what i want to do is attack those banks that are in the top left because theyve got all the share and all the vulnerability and so thats exactly the play that we have been making thats where we produced our share growth over the last almost for a decade now and thats where i would expect the growth to continue to come brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc and any idea terry where your natural penetration would be versus the overall footprint m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc what our penetration across the united states would be brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc no the nashville msa penetration of m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc versus m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 yeah im sorry i got it in nashville i cant recite the number but it would be a sort of penetration brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great thats helpful thanks for all the color guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you the next question will be from matt olney from stephens matt your line is live matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning want to go back to the discussion around loan yields and i think the loan yields increased this quarter around bps and i think you mentioned the benefits of the fixed rate repricing tailwinds could build throughout the year so any color for us as far as how we can be modeling those loan yields over the next few quarters assuming no rate changes harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think if you can i think our loan growth will be fairly we should get into that to range so i dont think itll be theres any kind of meaningful seasonality there matt so as you plan out the loan growth do that and that i think youll have to back into what our margin expectations are the loan yield we believe will be accretive we think well do more accretion here in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter gosh im trying to give you some direction here i think billion if you ph wipe billion of new loans coming in at call it or that would be ph helpful matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay got it well look at that and then i guess kind of a similar question harold on the securities yields you had some nice repricing all through i think youve got one of the higher yielding securities books in the peer group any more benefits this year if we assume higherforlonger or are we kind of topping out here harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think were getting close to kind of the top but we ought to see some accretion in the call it the second quarter it wont be a lot but hopefully well see some especially on the cash side we had a kind of a larger mix of call it cash balances versus the fed account here in the first quarter than we typically carry so were likely to see more money at the fed earning the higher rate on the cash side matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks guys appreciate it pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you matt operator thank you the next question will be from samuel varga from ubs samuel your line is live samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning i just wanted to go back to the fixed rate loan yields for a moment the current originations are obviously a little bit below the target range of the to and so i wanted to get a sense of especially with the potential rate hike in september do you expect to hit the low end or the middle of that range for that target range or should we just sort of expect that this is going to stay below for harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc as far as new accounts go samuel were actually pretty pleased with theyre hitting we did have call it a handful of larger credits that booked in the first quarter at call it in the high that did dilute that target from down to am i getting to your question samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thats perfect thats very helpful thank you harold and then the other question was just on credit so you upped the indiscernible guide a little bit obviously gave some commentary around that ph mta and specific reserve just wanted to get a sense of like the move to the to basis points is that should we expect that to be a chunky sort of outcome or is this a more broadbased sort of expectation of moving indiscernible content harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah for our planning i think thats a great question i think it will end up being chunky but right now were seeing as a fairly consistent so we dont see a big rise in it in the second quarter versus the third quarter versus the fourth quarter i think what were planning is to be fairly consistent from here on out samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc understood thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right samuel operator thank you the next question will be from jared shaw from barclays jared your line is live jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 thanks hey guys maybe just looking at the going back to the penetration market penetration slide how should we be thinking about maybe longer term loan growth from here like looking out as youre able to take market share in these high growth markets m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc im not sure ask it again jared im sorry im not i didnt quite get it jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah yeah i mean just with all the hiring youve been doing with people who are the best in their markets and going into higher growth markets how should we be thinking about longer term loan growth if we look out maybe over and as you are able to successfully or hopefully successfully take market share in these markets m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah my expectation is that it will work like it has worked and when i say that i think the last few quarters weve had a slide up in the actual call presentation deck that sort of show what was coming from all the new hiring versus not from the new hiring and of course as you know its substantially from the new hiring i think that slide found its way to the back of the deck as in the additional slides in the ph back that you can see in the percentages coming from there and so my expectation is that phenomenon will continue out for and ph both because well continue to hire more people and theyll continue to move those books and so what i think i mean loan growth is a pretty good number at least based on what i expect other people are able to produce but it is that is being done with legacy markets that are have more tepid growth and so once you get to a better economic landscape and you get the growth out of those legacy markets as weve talked a lot jared the growth that come from the new hires is not dependent upon economic conditions but the growth in the legacy markets is and so anyway i dont mean to go on too much but i expect that phenomenon to continue well hire more people theyll move their clients it will produce outsized growth as it has for some time and so forth and then if you get a tailwind here when economic conditions improve youre ought to produce even more outsized growth jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then theres something for me on bhg i mean harold maybe where do you see reserves peaking there harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i cant really yeah what they told me jared is that they believe the reserves are will probably maybe tweak up some from here but basically flattish from here ph on out they feel like theyre in pretty good shape with respect to the absolute levels the percentage levels in relation to loans pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks operator thank you the next question will be from brian martin from janney montgomery brian your line is live brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys most of mine have been answered here just a couple minor things harold just on the loan repricing that occurs the basis points is helpful is there a significant amount or a similar amount of that repricing that goes in next year as well just kind of thinking further out on the fixed rate side harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think that chart would show brian something like i think the blue bars go down the like million or something ph a quarter in in some neighborhood like that one thing and i hope matts still on the phone that i remembered is that the mix of our new loan generation now has gone from a floating rate to a floating to fixed today its running probably around floating to fixed so those floating rate credits are coming on at a higher yield than the ph or the fixed rate so thats another kind of tailwind that weve had to loan yields that will happen again in the fourth in the second quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you so that margin should continue to ramp if that repricing occurs and the deposits are stabilizing so okay and then harold just housekeeping on the equity investment line and the other in the fee income line is there anything funky this quarter or is that a pretty clean pretty normal type of level on those equity investments harold r carpenter a executive vice president chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont recall anything going on we did have a solar gain again this quarter but we think thats going to be replicated throughout the year so i dont we didnt point out any kind of a unusual number for that line item brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay understood and then just the last one was just on the deposit the proactive preemptive strikes you talked about is that continuing in second quarter or i guess if you kind of backed off that or i guess is that do you expect that to kind of continue and also support your kind of your margin commentary m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc brian its a great question what we have done is conduct an initiative where we asked people to go through and review and gave lists and try to provide infrastructure and basis for decent rates and so forth so that initiative has been done but i mean my view of it in this environment is ph its a war pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 well continue to look for ways to provide emphasis and opportunities to drive our cost of funds lower i cant recite what they are right this minute but again well be continuing to push on it but i think the specific point we were trying to make has harold expressed some optimism about lower cost thats a function of an initiative that has been conducted brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect thank you for taking the questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank
