executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 thanks bryan and good morning everybody as youve seen this morning our results for the quarter were solid on a preprovision basis but the extraordinary changes in the economic backdrop occurring in march and the implications of the broadbased response to the covid19 breakout had a material impact on our provision for credit losses before we go into the financials over i want to acknowledge the current environment obviously this pandemic is having a profound impact on the global economy and on peoples lives and the challenges we face as a country are unprecedented pnc through this period is navigating these challenges from a position of strength we have nearly employees who are working incredibly hard to serve our customers we immediately mobilized to mitigate the risks to our frontline employees and implemented enhanced pay provisions for those in roles that cannot be performed remotely our technology in which weve invested heavily over time allowed us to quickly transition to a remote work model for more than of our employees including those from our call center who are managing a very high call volume from the safety of their homes our technology also allowed us to quickly prepare for and respond to the federal governments economic stimulus package which we are supporting through loans and other relief to consumer and business customers as an aside since launching our online paycheck protection program portal on april weve received over applications and we have thousands of people working tirelessly to process these loan requests in accordance with the sbas requirements including documentation and have registered at this point actually as of this morning something over billion worth of these loans also the convenience and security of our mobile and online banking tools are allowing us to continue to provide critical banking services with minimal disruption despite the current economic challenges we are confident in our ability to continue to withstand strong environmental headwinds we have solid liquidity and capital positions we grew loans by billion and deposits by billion compared to the end of the fourth quarter while this was largely driven by draws on commercial lines of credit as robs going to take you through we have provided new loans to support key industries in our country since the covid outbreak including over billion in new loans to hospitals and other healthcare entities and billion in new loans to municipalities as an aside over the last few weeks and into april weve seen the rate of loan draws normalize in addition weve seen a meaningful increase in deposits with the growth in dollars now equal to the loan growth since the outbreak of covid19 were processing thousands of forbearance and loan modification requests for consumers todate consumer modifications weve had processed sorry as of april importantly of the of these are ph bankowned with the remainder being for loans that we service for others this may be the greatest challenge that many in our country have ever experienced many of our clients are experiencingfinancial hardship and despite their uncertainties our commitment to them is as certain as it has ever been now our results for the first quarter are shown on slide and while preprovision earnings increased the provision for credit losses of million increased million reflecting the new cecl standard while we developed our economic scenarios to account for covid19 i want to say that the economy has worsened since we closed the books on these numbers now rob will provide insight on how our scenarios have been impacted by some developments and how we would fare if the situation was to become more severe in that instance we would still be wellcapitalized highly liquid and be able to maintain our dividend while complying with capital standards the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 robs going to take you through the income statement but one thing i wanted to point out inside of our noninterest income is our security gains which were higher than usual this quarter and we realized these gains by taking advantage of some of the disruption in the fixed income markets that occurred before the fed stepped in and we still managed to increase our book yield on securities quarteroverquarter so if you think about it normally you sell securities and you replace them and your book yield goes down in this instance we actually increased our book yield and securities now before i turn it over to rob i want to recognize and thank our employees who are going above and beyond every day to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing additionally our regional presidents together with the pnc foundation are playing a critical role and upholding our commitment to the communities we serve by allocating critical funds to coronavirus relief efforts across our markets and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our first quarter results and then well be happy to take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc great thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on a spot basis while we typically cover our average balance sheet were going to focus on our spot balances this quarter due to the substantial increased activity late in the quarter related to the economic impact of covid19 on the asset side loan balances of billion at march were up billion or compared to december this growth reflected an increase in commercial loan balances of approximately billion primarily driven by higher utilization of loan commitments investment securities of billion increased billion or linked quarter also our cash balances at the federal reserve as of march were billion down billion from yearend in part due to the benefits from the regulatory tailoring rules on our liquidity effective january on the liability side deposit balances of billion at march were up billion or compared to december the high proportion of the commercial loan draws were placed back with us in the form of deposits and as a result noninterestbearing deposits grew billion or linked quarter total borrowed funds increased billion due to higher fhlb borrowings and increased debt issuance activity during the quarter as of march our basel iii common equity tier ratio was estimated to be which reflected the impact of the tailoring rules including our decision to opt out of aoci as well as our election to phase in cecls impact on our estimated regulatory capital while our capital ratios remained strong on march we announced the temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the federal reserves effort to support the us economy during this time it did not impact pncs dividend policy our tangible book value was per common share as of march an increase of compared to a year ago our loantodeposit ratio was at march and importantly our liquidity coverage ratio exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement as you can see on slide commercial loan unfunded commitments declined by approximately billion as customers drew down lines to bolster their liquidity or replace alternative funding channels as a result our the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 utilization rate increased from to the drawdowns weve experienced are diversified across industries and more than twothirds of the increased utilization is from investmentgrade borrowers while drawdowns were well above normal in midmarch we saw activity begin to slow at the end of the quarter and thats remained the case so far during the second quarter that said we do expect loan balances to be elevated for some time importantly pnc is wellpositioned with strong capital and liquidity and were committed to putting our resources to work to support our customers and the broader financial system at this critical time as you can see on the slide as of march we had approximately billion of readily available liquidity from diverse sources these sources along with substantially more availability from the fed discount window should it be necessary provide ample funding to meet the potential needs of our customers turning to slide were working to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through a variety of solutions during this time on the commercial side were offering relief for small and mediumsized business loans including those being provided through the federally enacted cares act we have received thousands of applications through the paycheck protection program and have begun to fund those loans successfully as bill just mentioned additionally were granting loan modifications to commercial clients primarily in the form of principal andor interest deferrals were analyzing and making decisions on these modifications based on each individual borrower situation with our consumer customers were also granting loan modifications through extensions deferrals and forbearance as of april we had completed over consumer loan modifications primarily related to covid19 and in addition were offering relief in the form of extended grace periods and halting all foreclosures while waiving certain fees and charges as you can see on slide first quarter total revenue was billion down million linked quarter or net interest income of billion was up million or compared to the fourth quarter as lower funding costs as well as higher loan and securities balances were partially offset by lower loan yields and one less day in the quarter our net interest margin increased to up basis points linked quarter in large part due to lower rates paid on deposits noninterest income declined million or linked quarter reflecting stable fee revenue that was offset by lower other noninterest income noninterest expense declined million or compared to the fourth quarter with all categories essentially flat to down our efficiency ratio was in the first quarter improving from in the previous quarter provision for credit losses in the first quarter was million reflecting the adoption of the cecl methodology including the economic effects of covid19 and loan growth and our effective tax rate in the first quarter was in light of the current economic circumstances related to covid19 naturally were evaluating and monitoring our entire loan portfolio however we believe the industry sectors likely to be most impacted are on slide our outstanding loan balances as of march to these industries are billion and represents of our total loan portfolio corporate loan balances in these industries totaled billion within this group were most focused on our exposures to retail restaurants and certain parts of leisure travel in retail total loans outstanding are billion of which are assetbased restaurant loan outstandings are billion and cruise lines and commercial airlines together total less than million the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 in our commercial real estate portfolio we have billion in outstandings in areas most likely to be impacted by covid19 this includes cre properties of billion of which are stabilized and under construction all with a portfolio ltv of the remaining billion of exposure is to reits approximately twothirds of which are investmentgrade turning to slide this is an update on our oil and gas portfolio given the continued pressures on the energy industry at the end of the first quarter we had total outstandings of billion in oil and gas loans or just less than of our total outstanding loans we last updated you on this portfolio in the fourth quarter of while we were relatively pleased with the performance of this portfolio through the last oil and gas downturn of ph especially with respect to reservebased lending structures accordingly the growth in our portfolio since ph has been primarily in the upstream segments which carry these structures as well as the midstream segme nts which tend to perform relatively well under stress nearly all of our losses from the ph downturn occurred in our services book which has declined as a percentage of total loans from the fourth quarter of ph and notably approximately million or of the billion of this sector is assetbased we will continue to monitor market conditions and actively manage our energy portfolio our credit quality metrics are presented on slide net chargeoffs for loans and leases were stable with the fourth quarter increasing slightly by million annualized net chargeoffs to total loans was also stable with the fourth quarter at basis points nonperforming loans increased million or compared to december and total delinquencies declined million linked quarter or the ratios for both nonperforming loans to total loans and delinquencies to total loans decreased in the quarter as you can see our provision for first quarter increased substantially to million reflecting the adoption of the cecl methodology including the economic effects of covid19 and loan growth since the adoption of cecl on january weve increased our reserves by approximately billion as a result at march our allowance for credit losses including unfunded balances to total loans was and our allowance to nonperforming loans was slide shows the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses and ultimately our provision under cecl our attribution shows the increase in reserves for the cecl day one transition adjustment of million as well as portfolio changes and economic factors portfolio changes represent the impact of shifts in loan balances age and mix as well as credit quality and net chargeoff activity these factors accounted for million of the change in our reserves for the first quarter of economic factors represent our evaluation and determination of an economic forecast applied to our loan portfolios to accomplish this we use a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period and a weighted average of four different economic scenarios at quarterend importantly each of these scenarios were designed to address at that time the emerging covid19 crises this approach provided a blended scenario as of march which when compared to the scenarios used for our transition calculation resulted in an increase in reserves of million for the first quarter for this blended approach we used a number of economic variables with the largest driver being gdp in this scenario annualized gdp contracts in the second quarter of and finishes the year down with recovery of the prerecession peak levels occurring by the fourth quarter of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 since the end of the first quarter when we finalized our cecl estimate the macroeconomic backdrop has worsened suggesting a deeper decline in gdp and other economic factors than what our march scenario contemplated should these macroeconomic factors persist well adjust our blended scenario accordingly which would likely result in a material build to our reserves during the second quarter additionally for our own stress informational purposes we considered our most extreme adverse scenario in isolation to determine a hypothetical yearend capital and liquidity impact this scenario is even more severe than the ccar severely adverse scenario it assumes a annualized contraction in gdp in the second quarter of followed by another annualized contraction in the third quarter leading to a peak to trough decline of this compares to the ccar severely adverse scenario peak to trough decline of to be clear this scenario is not our expectation nor does this exercise attempt to capture all the potential unknown variables that would likely arise but simply provides an approximation of outcome under these circumstances this results in an approximately cet1 ratio at yearend and we believe would allow us to continue to support our current dividend in summary looking at the remainder of the year we expect a challenging environment as a result of the covid pandemic we expect a significant contraction in gdp and we expect the fed funds rate to remain in its current range of to basis points throughout clearly the biggest variables impacting the economy will be the length of the crisis and the efficacy of the massive us government support and stimulus programs while were hopeful the duration will be short and the government programs prove highly effective at this time we naturally have no way of knowing these outcomes accordingly our visibility is low however based on what we think now we can provide a second quarter guidance and some directional thoughts for the full year for the second quarter of compared to the first quarter of we expect growth in average loans to be in the high singledigit range as a result of the increased spot level at quarterend as well as additional anticipated funding needs of our commercial and consumer customers we expect nii to be stable we expect total noninterest income to be down approximately to mostly reflecting the elevated msrs and securities gains that we generated amidst the volatility during the first quarter we also expect some general softening in fee categories as well particularly service charges on deposits while we continue to waive fees for our customers during this crisis we expect total noninterest expense to be flat to down and in regard to net chargeoffs we expect second quarter levels to be between million and million up quarteroverquarter as we begin to experience the economic effects of the crisis for the full year and for the reasons previously stated our visibility is substantially limited but with that in mind we now expect both full year revenue and noninterest expense to each be down between and and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch very much appreciate the comments on the extremely adverse scenario as we think about the dividend im wondering as you think about your companyrun test in a severely adverse scenario i think last year over nine quarters you estimated losses of and im wondering you ph clearly say thats the difference in unemployment rate whats different from a negative obviously from that scenario of this economic outlook that were staring down at versus the severely adverse and whats better and how ph do the cumulative losses compare to that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well just on cumulative losses the scenario we ran and jump in here where you want rob basically had us coming up with losses of billion in whereas the severely adverse in ccar had roughly billion over the nine quarters so its much worse maybe thats a simple soundbite to it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika thats exactly right so its more severe in the sense that we frontend those losses into the next nine months whereas ccar and dfast contemplated that over nine quarters william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and the peak to trough what did we do on gdp robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc about william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah versus on the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc adverse robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right so much sharper and faster william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just to clarify the question im wondering what you think your cume losses could actually be so theres that extremely adverse scenario with that billion shock in and then we have that other data point of severely adverse so wondering based on what you know now cumulative losses could look like william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats an unanswerable question so what we tried to do was barbell it for you we would tell you and i had this in my script that since we closed the books we saw claims be higher than we had assumed we changed from thinking that a vshaped recovery was going to happen fast into more of a ushaped recovery so thats why we kind of put comments out there that were going to have a reserve build likely into the second quarter if we had perfect foresight here the reserve trueup we would have taken in the first quarter would have effectively marked our book to current economy and future provision would simply be based on growth so it would go way down in practice given were seeing the economy worsen from our assumptions again sort of dragging out further unemployment a little bit higher well see reserve build into the second quarter that doesnt mean its going to be necessarily higher than the first quarter it doesnt mean that its going to be lower than the first quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right no comment on the magnitude but the fluidity of where we are william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so trying to give you some precise science with all of these unknowns out there i dont think is a useful exercise what i did think was useful is simply make it as ugly as we can make it and show that we are still highly liquid and at that point basis points over the regulatory minimum so we can operate in this environment the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and thats the primary point erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch understood and the followup question is probably equally unanswerable but this is our first recession obviously in a cecl construct and many management teams have noted that cecl is procyclical by nature and im wondering if again we could have some sort of guardrails in terms of where reserve to loans could build to and i guess the big investor question is is that given the amount of ppnr strengths and capital levels banks have there seems to be an opportunity to anticipate the future provisions ahead of when chargeoffs are recognized so is there something in cecl that would allow you to recognize those ahead of chargeoffs and perhaps when the chargeoffs actually hit the draw on your provision costs wont be as painful indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so thats a cecl question i mean basically cecl itself in its perfect form if our economic predictions were correct today our reserve would cover the entire portfolio as it runs down including chargeoffs and any change in provision would come from the rundown of the portfolio upgrades and downgrades of the portfolio and then additions to the portfolio so cecl by its very nature is ahead of the chargeoffs robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph like the loans william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah it has those embedded in that so again if our assumptions were correct in the first quarter and we think that they werent conservative enough but if they were and we just quit lending were covered thats what cecl is designed to do and in theory if that were correct our provision would decline through here from the print in the first quarter through the rest of the year in practice were saying we think the economy is worse and therefore the provision will be elevated beyond what we would provide for simple loan growth and beyond that we cant get any more exact robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right thats right erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful i appreciate it thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning john william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi so back to your point around that you cant rule out an incremental material addition to the reserve in i know you just said its tough to size it up i guess im trying to figure out how we could think about the magnitude like how much would the potential addition in the second quarter how much would that have differed under your base scenario that you embedded in the first quarter provision versus that more severe scenario can you give us a little bit of color that way william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well versus the severely adverse we talked about by billion but thats not the one we expect versus whats happened in the economy put it into context from what ive seen other people do just against chargeoffs go back to kind of basics i think we provided for times or something like that our chargeoffs in the quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats the ratio indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats pretty similar to what everybodys done jp was a little bit higher than that i think but people are kind of right around that number should it have been times yeah maybe but in context against what we know if we were light its not orders of magnitude light were supposed to have we should have been a couple hundred million more and again im making up a number here and by the way a week from now i can give you a different number robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph and thats the final point the fluidity of the situation john as you know is moving so fast so on any given day the scenarios can change we felt good about our estimate at march its deteriorated from then the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 for the second quarter it could move around a lot over the next couple of months and when we go to do our cecl estimates for the second quarter well factor all that in william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and not withstand i actually notwithstanding all the magic that goes into the cecl models i did gain some amount of comfort from the fact that at least for the big banks that have reported todate that the numbers are kind of similar as a function of multiples of chargeoffs robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and reserves are increasing substantially william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay all right and then in terms of your loan modifications i appreciate the color you gave us on the consumer modifications but are you starting to see restructurings or modifications on the commercial side and if you are what amount or balances have you restructured on the commercial end robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats been slower and as i mentioned in my comments john we handle that on an individual basis with customers so theres been some of it but nowhere near the volume on the consumer side william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think whats happening think about it occurring with smaller commercial small business clients a lot of it real estate related not surprised where were kind of deferring interest for days or something when we do it as an aside isnt actually changing the rating of the credit so they were good credits theyve got a cash flow crunch were waiving interest or payment or something and it doesnt necessarily trigger an outright downgrade so its kind of case by case its building and ultimately its going to result in losses and thats what were reserved for robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and its something weve got our eye on for the second quarter but its nowhere near the volume of that consumer john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you appreciate it the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah i was hoping to ask another question on the modification so specifically in the billion of consumer mods you guys have done how does that break down between im guessing its mostly mortgages but among the various consumer categories where are you seeing and i guess whats your sense for where that ultimately could go robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah right now it is investor versus bankowned and the vast majority of that being mortgage the other significant category is auto but mortgage is the largest r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and the other im just looking at some numbers here the other thing on auto is for example we have about million in auto where weve had mods but if memory serves we on any given day have half of that in the normal course so some of these totals were close to billion a big chunk of that is kind of in the ordinary course of what you see in consumer and to be honest with you we struggled a little bit to break out how much of this is really covidrelated versus how much of this is basic churn in the consumer book robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but the majority is mortgage and the majority is investorowned r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you and then one i guess a little more ph ticky tack just in your other fees i mean a lot of private equity marks presumably those arent the kind of things that will persist do you guys have a sense for where that other line ends up going as we look forward robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well thats why for the second quarter at least i combined other with the fee income and we have the total fee down to so thats about as precise as i can get the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hopefully we wont see the private equity valuation marks that we saw in the first quarter but who knows r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah exactly okay sounds perfect thank you guys very much robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with nomura please go ahead bill carcache q analyst nomura securities intl america hi good morning bill and rob i had a clarification question on your cecl methodology comments it sounds like youre basing the allowance on economic forecasts available through and to the extent there was deterioration in the outlook as we got into early april with expectations for unemployment and gdp growth further deteriorating you would not be factoring in that incremental deterioration into your allowance even though that deterioration arguably existed at the balance sheet date because you didnt find out about it until april is that right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no because the thing that changed the most right was the shock that the market had on unemployment claims the two weeks in a row where they kind of went million a week and that was close to close so thats the biggest change we saw the other thing thats impacting how we think of this the gdp decline is probably right the unemployment decline we need to think through how to model correctly because of the amount of government dollars that are going into unemployed pockets so the normal impact youd see from the spike in unemployment that would drive gdp further down doesnt feel right and i guess thats more than you want to know but thats what we have to sort of model ph and think about robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and thats a challenge for us in the second quarter for sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah as we get into the second quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 bill carcache q analyst nomura securities intl america yeah i guess i was just trying to see if theres any implication that as long as the delta and expectations were to continue to deteriorate post balance sheet dates as we go forward from here whether we can expect there to be incremental reserve building continuing even though cecl in theory should already be capturing lifetime losses setting aside of course any growth that you have to reserve for william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but the basic notion is that that reserve gets marked to your best expectations of economic outcome when you close the books robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which is what we do william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc which is what we did and what we will do robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc okay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and what were saying all were saying today is all else equal what i know now a couple of weeks post is the economy is a little bit worse than what we assume we close the books and well capture that in the second quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah were mindful of that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and if we get it right in the second quarter then there wouldnt be any more build in the third quarter and its as simple as that were not trying to dont confuse that with orders of magnitude to my point i mean things could get horrific and weve shown you the horrific number robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah and the only thing that i would add to that is and you know it bill is just the fluidity of all this it moves fast daily and well continue to monitor it and build it into our scenarios the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 bill carcache q analyst nomura securities intl america got it thanks rob thats helpful robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst nomura securities intl america and bill if i may just one last followup on the i guess the fee income growth opportunity in the period leading up to the great recession you guys stood out for slowing loan growth and stepping on the gas to grow fee income the fee income side of the business as we look back to this recession several years from now what do you think will stand out about the way that pnc handled itself both in the period leading up to and during the recession william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well i think without question our loan book is going to stand out weve said this forever we havent changed our credit box were going to have losses but they are going to be losses that you would otherwise expect for the way we talk about our credit and i think in an environment like this i always say the cost of goods sold actually becomes known to people robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so i think that stands out i think our willingness to extend capital intelligently to clients is going to stand out as it did in the crisis we have an opportunity to grow good clients and support existing clients with our liquidity and capital and we are going to do that we do have as you know some very stable fee streams in particular our treasury management business which is doing fantastically well and is very stable and will support us through this we have for the quarter and probably for the next quarter or so our capital markets activity has been very strong so i think were in a really good position and we sit as a management team here working tirelessly to support our clients and with mixed emotions in the sense that this is the environment we run our company for right our company is built around being able to support people and grow when everybody else falters bill carcache q analyst nomura securities intl america thats super helpful thanks bill thanks bill and rob thats super helpful robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thanks bill the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 operator there are no further questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc okay william stanton
