assessment excluding this onetime charge we delivered earnings per share of this quarter was highlighted by an increase in net interest income continued fee income growth prudent expense management credit quality stabilization and strong capital accretion notably our return on tangible common equity increased to on an adjusted basis turning to slide revenue growth for the quarter was supported by improved spread income as well as continued growth across many of our feebased businesses on both a linkedquarter and yearoveryear basis noninterest expense as adjusted was down benefiting from crosssynergies with union bank prudent expense management and multiyear investments across the business that have resulted in greater efficiencies and enhanced operating effectiveness as i mentioned earlier credit quality results were in line with our expectations as we saw stabilization in delinquency rates and a modest increase in npas average total deposits increased and we continued to see growth in consumer deposits despite industry and liquidity headwinds us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 as of june our tangible book value per share increased to or better than last quarter and higher than last year our cet1 capital ratio increased basis points from the prior quarter and basis points from last year to end the quarter at john will discuss some key takeaways from this years stress test in his opening remarks slide provides key performance metrics excluding notable items our return on average assets increased to and return on average common equity improved to our efficiency ratio also improved from the first quarter to on an adjusted basis turning to slide fee income represents just over of total net revenue and benefited this quarter from high seasonal revenues across each of our payment businesses strong core growth in trust and investment management fees as well as improved treasury management revenue overall diversified fee income businesses continue to operate at scale and provide earnings consistency through the cycle and most importantly we are encouraged by the progress were making to deepen our most profitable client relationships expand our product set and enhance our distribution channels these efforts are positioning us well for continued growth and strategic differentiation let me now turn the call over to john who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forwardlooking guidance john c stern senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet summary followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings friends total average deposits increased billion or on a linkedquarter basis to billion driven by stable institutional deposit balances and continued consumer balance growth average noninterest bearing deposits decreased billion or on a linkedquarter basis as we continue to emphasize stickier relationshipbased deposit generation the pace of decline in noninterestbearing balances continued to slow this quarter as the chart in the upper left shows we are prudently managing our pricing as we remained focused on retaining and growing core operational relationships across the franchise average total loans were billion an increase of billion or linked quarter the increase was driven by higher credit card loans from higher spend volumes and increased commercial loans from growth in corporate banking loan growth this quarter was partially offset by lower commercial real estate and total other retail loans with elevated deposit levels we opportunistically increased the size of our investment securities portfolio with shortdated highquality securities to better optimize cash levels as a result the ending balance on our investment portfolio was billion as of june actions taken on the investment portfolio this quarter together with approximately billion of securities runoff resulted in an average yield increase to a basispoint increase from the prior quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 going forward we would expect the balance on the investment portfolio to remain relatively flat to the current level and for the reinvestment benefit from quarterly securities runoff to be approximately basis points to basis points on average based on current rates slide highlights our credit quality performance asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with expectations and we remain appropriately reserved for potential adverse economic conditions in the second quarter delinquencies were flat sequentially nonperforming assets increased approximately linked quarter reflecting a slower pace of change the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was basis points at june compared with basis points at march and basis points a year ago our second quarter net chargeoff ratio of basis points increased basis points from the first quarter in line with our expectations and we continue to expect our net chargeoff ratio to approach basis points in the second half of this year our allowance for credit losses as of june totaled billion or of periodend loans slide provides a more detailed earnings summary in the second quarter we reported per diluted share which included per share or a million charge for an increase in the fdic special assessment following last years bank failures turning to slide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately billion an increase of on a linkedquarter basis the increase in net interest income this quarter was driven by a combination of deposit volume growth pricing stabilization and slower migration as well as fixed asset repricing improved loan mix and other actions taken on the investment portfolio to optimize cash balances elevated deposit levels and higher onbalance sheet liquidity drove a 3basispoint decline in net interest margin this quarter to slide highlights trends in noninterest income fee income increased million or on a linkedquarter basis driven by seasonally higher payments revenue and stronger mortgage banking fees which included an approximate million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights this increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in commercial product revenue due to lower corporate bond fees and losses on the investment securities sales of million noninterest income through the first six months of the year increased on a yearoveryear basis as we continue to benefit from deepening client relationships across our fee businesses turning to slide noninterest expense as adjusted decreased million or on a linkedquarter basis the decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and employee benefit expense which was partially offset by higher net occupancy and equipment as well as marketing and business development costs yearover year noninterest expense as adjusted decreased million or as we prudently managed expenses identified operational efficiencies across the business and realized synergies from the union bank acquisition turning to slide our common equity tier ratio of as of june was reflective of a 30basispoint increase from the first quarter and a 120basispoint improvement compared to last year on june the federal reserve released its stress test results consistent with the industry the feds modeled results were largely reflective of an assumption taken to significantly lower fee income and increase provision expense in stress which resulted in a 60basispoint increase to our preliminary stress capital buffer of we remain well capitalized and prepared to manage any potential industry stress that might result from a severe macroeconomic downturn us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 i will now provide forwardlooking guidance on slide which is consistent with our previous guidance we expect net interest income for the third quarter on an fte basis to be relatively stable to the second quarter full year net interest income on an fte basis is expected to be in the range of billion to billion for the full year we expect to achieve midsingledigit growth in noninterest income as adjusted we continue to expect fullyear noninterest expense as adjusted of billion or lower let me now turn it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john ill finish up on slide second quarter results highlighted the resiliency of a business model that features a highly diversified revenue mix strong risk management discipline and a robust earnings and capital generation profile we remain focused on our core competencies and are aggressively building upon our key differentiators the investments were making across the businesses are showing through in the form of enhanced customer acquisition improved client experiences and deeper relationships that are further propelling our growth story expense management is a key priority for us and we remained focused on our target of positive operating leverage in the second half of this year and beyond looking ahead we are well positioned to continue to build upon our solid foundation and already established interconnectedness across the business with the scale reach and product capabilities thatll allow us to deliver industryleading returns well into the future let me close by thanking our employees for everything they do to make us the destination of choice for many clients communities and shareholders we serve well now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co john hey john i was hoping you could please sort of discuss the puts and takes within the nii trajectory from here looks like we would hopefully get a bump in the fourth quarter after a stable third quarter if wed sort of assume the midpoint of the fullyear range i guess maybe just a thought or two on factors that would cause you to come in either toward the high end or the low end of the fullyear range please john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure scott good morning were first of all were pleased to see our net interest income grow and we like the actions that weve taken to position ourselves for the future deposit rotation and rates paid have stabilized loan mix has improved our fixed assets earning asset repricing continues to march on and weve been opportunistically working with the investment portfolio to deploy excess liquidity so if you think about some of these things going forward the higher and lower end of the range id cite a couple different things first of all i would just say as i mentioned we expect stable third quarter net interest income and then from there we do expect growth we would anticipate that the pluses and minuses is going to be depending upon deposit rotation and beta we do expect some level of rotation out of deposits going forward but its going to be relatively modest and as you can tell slowed in terms of rate paid thats going to be dependent on the market but as you can tell that has slowed as well and we feel good about our positioning for rate cuts as we move forward should they occur our earning assets we know are going to be formulaic and continue to reprice whether thats the investment portfolio or the mortgage book we expect kind of in that basis point to basis point range on average given current levels and then loan growth we assume to be very modest in our forecast kind of going forward just kind of given the loan dynamics that were seeing and then finally i would just say although its not as going to be meaningful for is just the actions of the fed and what they do whether they cut or not so those are the puts and takes as we think about the next couple quarters us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you john and then maybe if i could ask you to delve a little more deeply into one portion of that just you noted modest loan growth here going forward what are you all seeing in terms of commercial loan demand i guess i sort of ask within the backdrop of modest outlook but your average commercial loan growth this quarter looked a little more favorable than what weve seen from peers so just curious as to sort of the inside baseline on that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so i think on loan growth we did see pockets of loan growth occur in the corporate loan book but i think our overall thesis really hasnt changed over the last several quarters the loan growth environment remains tepid it remains theres caution in the clients but theres a lot of interest rate movement and im sure that could spark some things but overall its still a very tepid market and we just happened to find good some pockets of growth on the corporate loan book this quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just wondering john just following up on the nii my math like your fourth quarter could be as high as billion so appreciate the puts and takes you provided earlier as we think about the nii trajectory from here in a rate cut scenario just remind us in terms of the positioning of the balance sheet what four to six rate cuts would imply and flex on the deposit side given sort of your sort of corporate institutional makeup john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 sure thanks ebrahim so the way i think about potential rate cut shift and change in market there is that we are well positioned given the mix of our deposit base so approximately of our balances are retailbased and about of our balances are institutional or corporate type balances and in a cut environment those institutional corporate balances the beta if you will of those are going to go down as quickly as they came up so we feel very good about the repositioning of that on the retail side i would just say that there will always be some arc to the retail so there will be probably some repricing that occurs at the sofr higher levels but over time those balances will come down and so overall it gives us an advantage as the curve in theory should start to steepen and you have a lower shortterm rate and a higher longer term rate that allows for continued earning asset favorability on the repricing side of things ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just separately when you think about the outlook for the back half on fee revenue growth the midsingle digits where do you think fee revenue growth is going to be driven what categories are going to drive that growth where do you expect some more moderation relative to what weve seen in the first half of the year thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure i think on the fee side of things we had a solid quarter but we continue to expect momentum in the various categories and its going to be a combination of all the main ones its going to be payments its going to be our trust and investment management fees and its going to be in the capital market space is probably the three areas that i would point you to on the payment side of things we continue to see strong core competencies whether in merchant processing youre talking about our techled areas if youre talking about our corporate payments side of things youre looking at us starting to lap some of the things in freight and fleet and in credit credit card we continue to see strong spend levels so those are all going to be positive things for us as we move forward the trust and investment management fees as well as the capital markets continue to see very strong market backdrop and we have been doing very well in terms of investment in those businesses and as well as just utilizing our client base and deepening relationships there in a number of different facets and then those are going to be kind of the tailwinds that we see that position us well for continuing our guidance here in terms of midsingle digit growth for fees ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp hi good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i know we already talked a little bit about the loan growth piece but going through the slide deck you highlighted that theres utilization rate increase so i guess im just wondering and its important right because at least youre the first institution ive seen this quarter thats had a utilization increase do you think thats a function of the types of industries where youre seeing utilization increase or is that more your new geographies where perhaps more focused attention on new clients is driving that would just like ph clarity on that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure thanks betsy so in terms of utilization it did tick up i would say its pretty modest and i would say its pretty much in line with where weve seen in the past i wouldnt point to it as some new trend that were going to see continued utilization investment or increase i think its really more of a function of the loan mix that we saw this quarter some of the loans that were brought on came at a high utilization level versus some of the things that rolled off so i just think its more of a mix shift rather than a change in trend betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then just on the credit outlook here i got a sense that maybe there was a little bit more credit coming through towards the back half of the year is that right or did i get that wrong john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well i dont think our well first of all our guidance really hasnt changed from a credit standpoint it continues to be its stabilizing its as expected from a net chargeoff perspective we came in at basis points we would anticipate approaching basis points here in the back half of the year is kind of how were thinking about the chargeoff but things like delinquencies and nonperforming those metrics have come in have stabilized and have come in very nicely giving us confidence in our credit outlook betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and are you already reserved for those ncos or just wondering if theres a reserve release behind that as well john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 yeah we feel very much appropriately reserved for the book that we have we saw a little bit of increase in our reserve build this quarter just simply because of growth particularly in cards and things of the like so thats kind of what has been the driver on the reserve side betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay super thanks so much john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please go ahead your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question morning first question is for you andy i think what was really striking about this quarter is that the balance sheet growth was impressive on both sides of the sheet and really outperforming peers at the same time i think we were all surprised by the stress test results especially given we thought that the ppnr dynamics with mufg fully baked in would be a little bit cleaner and so if im calculating this right your adjusted cet1 would be this quarter versus and im wondering as we think about balancing those dynamics how are you thinking about managing growth relative to this sort of changing unpredictable element of the scb plus obviously you havent done a great job at managing risk weighted assets last year and obviously theres a burnoff rate to the aoci at the same time rates are staying a little bit higher for longer and theres a huge debate on whats going to happen to the belly of the curve even as everyone scribes to fed cuts so im wondering how we should think about balance sheet management from here especially in light of the good growth that you experienced this quarter andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp sure thanks erika and let me start on the ccar results so as you think about mufg the component that we were focused on there that did happen was the expense component that came down so that was as expected the component that went up versus the fed last year was the fee income component and we dont have a lot of clarity or transparency into why that happened it happened for a number of banks and it happened in spite of the fact that our fee growth is actually even positive so that was the part that was the driver of the increased scb for us and for a number of other banks us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 let me take a step back and let me talk about capital and the balance sheet overall as weve talked about in the past erika our priorities from a capital distribution standpoint havent changed first is investing in the business second is dividends and third is buybacks and so as a part of this years stress test as weve talked about our planned capital distribution assumed an increase to the quarterly dividend of about starting in the fourth quarter and as you saw and as you referenced our cet1 ratio was this quarter so we continue to have strong capital accretion each quarter we expect to be well above our fully loaded cat ii capital targets well before we will cross that threshold so from a capital standpoint were comfortable with our levels and our ability to accrete basis points to basis points a quarter so the one open item as you all know is the final basel iii endgame rules and while we prefer to have those clarified before revising our capital and distribution targets we will assess whatever information we have available and update on our capital distribution our targets as well as our return targets at investor day on september erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so andy just as my followup based on what youve just told us it doesnt seem as if as we think about the rest of and the ccar years of october till september of next year it doesnt sound like we should expect a similar active balance sheet management in terms of growth as we saw in andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp so as weve talked about i think most of the capital accretion going forward erika will be through normal earnings accretion and as we talked about we expect that to be basis points to basis points we had a little bit of a benefit this quarter from additional rwa optimization but going forward i would think about that basis points to basis points a quarter erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay perfect thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning i just wanted to ask you to dig in a little bit on the payments business obviously the sequential math worked as normal but the yearoveryear growth looked like it slowed from in the first quarter to in the second i know we have some easier comps coming up in the second half but can you just kind of us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 help us understand just the absolute trajectory within the three business areas and how do you expect that kind of growth rate to go aside from just comps thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so thanks ken and i do agree i think we do expect momentum part of that is comps but were not obviously relying on that if i kind of think about the different businesses here maybe ill just start with merchant processing we have seen very good core growth in our techled initiative thats about a third of our sales now and has been growing at a very strong rate the margins on that business have we are seeing nice expansion there and a lot of our nontravel categories are really seeing very good growth so those are kind of the tailwinds we have seen some headwinds this quarter particularly on travel volumes in europe but that is something that we hope that will reverse and things of that nature but otherwise we feel like were positioned well on the merchant side of things on the retail card side credit card spend is strong and constructive i would say the union bank client acquisition were continuing to increase the penetration rate there but we did see a little bit of a decrease as well just because of risk mitigation around prepaid card which may pressure this quarter but may linger into a couple quarters as we move forward but still we think that the strong growth on the retail side of things is going to continue to be very helpful and then on the corporate side of things we are starting to get into that inflection point of lapping freight and fleet and all those sorts of things as well as our bank card is really performing quite well and so i think those are really some of the things i think especially on corporate payments by lapping that fleet kind of in the third quarter or so is going to allow for very strong rates as we think about the fourth quarter so at a high level we just think that theres momentum on the side of things that will allow us to grow and grow nicely ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you one more followup on nii you had a really good second quarter result but the outlook for the third quarter is stable and thats with an extra day and im just wondering can you just work us through like whats the holdback in terms of nii not just growing from here was there either some things that helped in the second that dont recur looked like your securities yields were a lot higher as one example but im not sure if that would have been it so like why dont we just see the growth straight up from that to zone we just saw on the second quarter thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure well i think it just comes down to the question earlier that is really around the range of outcomes that whats going to drive it and its really going to be around the deposit behavior and thing now we saw very good trends in terms of rotation out of dda that pace has certainly slowed we continue to expect it to slow moving forward but it doesnt mean its over right and so theres that component on the rate paid side of things were just monitoring just how the competitiveness of the deposit rates will go and quite frankly we dont expect a lot of deposit growth in the next quarter just simply because qt is still around and is still putting pressure on industry liquidity for us and for the market and so thats the primary driver is just kind of us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 the watch of that and then on top of that we just dont know if the fed will cut or not i know the market has priced that in but thats another factor in this sort of thing so those would be the factors i would call out andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp and john in our projections weve assumed two more rate cuts john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp we have andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp for september and december john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thats right weve assumed september and december for rate cuts thats right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it great thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i just think my math is wrong here you can help me out with that again even assuming the four items you just mentioned for nii not going higher in the third quarter if you could just highlight your fixed asset repricing a little bit more heres my math and its clearly wrong because one you said securities should reprice up basis points to basis points per quarter if i heard that correctly so if you take basis points on billion of security that would be like million extra next quarter if you take your mortgage book of billion and you take basis points on that i wasnt sure if you meant basis points on that but then you get us to almost million more for nii on a base of billion that would be growth next quarter growth the quarter after that et cetera et cetera and thats not your guidance so first if you can just fix my math as far as the fixed asset repricing on the securities and mortgages what im doing wrong and then confirm or not those four items that you mentioned to offset all of that thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure mike good to have you too so i think in terms of the math or in terms of mortgage thats going to continue given thats very much a fixed rate book on the investment portfolio given current rates we would expect basis point to basis point increase however we assume in our projections that we just mentioned that there will be a cut in september and about half of our book is floating rate or swap to floating and that sort of thing and so that will impact the investment portfolio that way and the deposits of course on the other side of that will start to shift of course the institutional side would start to move right away but the retail side will have an arc to it and so the movement of the cut within the quarter which is sort of a part of why we anticipate a relatively stable third quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just for clarification you did intend the mortgage book should reprice upward by basis points in the quarter also same as the securities john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah thats right mortgage book is kind of in that basis point to basis point range mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one more followup and ill requeue your noninterest bearing deposits you mentioned that as one of the risk factors you said its slowing can you remind us what it did between the second and first quarter and whats your alltime low for that ratio john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp on the mix of dda to total deposits is i think or so is where we came in this quarter it was a quarter ago it was or so the quarter before that so that pace is changing and slowing and in terms of where it goes its going to be just how clients behave and all that sort of thing but it is an alltime low for us for sure as we look back at our data andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp and mike on slide theres a chart upper left that shows the migration out that has slowed it was in the fourth quarter down in the first quarter and then slowed to down in the second quarter of mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp sure us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi andy hi john andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp morning gerald gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john you talked about the deposits and how you would approach them as the fed starts to cut rates i thought it was interesting in your supplement on the average balance sheet that your largest deposit category if im seeing it correctly money market savings the yield was down from the prior quarter at versus in the march quarter can you share with us what kind of strategies you used or what took that down when many of the other rates like time deposits obviously went up in the quarter john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure gerard no problem so if you look at that category its as you mentioned our largest category for deposits so its a mix of wholesale as well as retail and small business and all that sort of thing and i think what we have done is in light of loan growth obviously it grew a little bit but its not again its not growing tremendously and so we had the opportunity to look at our relationships across the bank and price things in an appropriate manner that makes sense for us to do and so weve taken some opportunities to exit some high cost deposits and weve really utilized our distribution network whether thats on the retail side the branch network our app capabilities really taking advantage and our partnerships really taking advantage of our national bank reach and really growing in deposits in areas that have a lower cost and so thats kind of the positive rotation that youre seeing in that specific category gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i got it i dont want to put words in your mouth but when the fed starts to cut rates from this line item at least you guys could potentially benefit from lower rates and the balances continue to grow which obviously would be beneficial andy just a more bigger macro question john touched a little bit a moment ago about the utilization rate on the ci loans can you share with us when you guys go out and talk to clients commercial clients that is what are they thinking about capex spending which would enable them to draw down lines and then second are you seeing any increased competition from alternative lenders whether its private credit or other that may be affecting the ci loan growth us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah gerard i think our clients are probably a little bit more focused on defense than offense right now we just did a ceo survey and we talk to clients they are focused on productivity efficiency expense management and in the investments that theyre making to the extent that theyre utilizing lending activity is to really amplify some of that efficiency opportunity that theyre focused on so a little bit more on defense but as john mentioned utilization rates were up modestly in pockets across the board and i would expect that to continue as we go forward so nothing significantly different from what we saw in prior quarters the competition is strong so both bank and nonbank competition thats driving pricing a little bit were continuing to seek full relationships with appropriate returns and that will drive the volumes as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and just as a quick followup on the competition are you guys seeing more aggressive underwriting for banks that want to grow that balance sheet how are you seeing that from the underwriting standpoint andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah not sure that the underwriting is changing significantly as opposed to pricing gerard thats how i would focus on it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you andy andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc wanted to circle back on payments a lot of good detail kind of by segment but was wondering if you could update your thoughts on the growth you expect for full year this year and then just still it might be a little bit lower than what you were thinking before and then just the mediumterm outlook if thats still the same us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah ill answer your second question first the medium term outlook has not changed in terms of growth rate trajectory for the payment businesses so we think of highsingledigit growth in terms of the merchant and corporate payments system categories and we think of midsingledigit growth as we get into the credit card debit card kind of area as i mentioned we had or so and then growth this quarter and the last two quarters on a yearoveryear basis we would expect momentum as we move forward and getting and approaching those sort of medium term levels and some of the puts and takes id mentioned earlier are going to be kind of the drivers of that and of course whether or not were on the higher end or the lower end is going to depend upon spend levels and where that kind of ultimately comes through but we feel confident in terms of where the markets going and how that is so we feel like were well positioned in that space matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then whats the prepaid card risk mitigation that you referred to maybe i missed if youve mentioned that in the past but could you just remind us what that is and how long it might be a ph drag for thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure yeah its just more fraud and things of that variety that has picked up and so we just theres just some areas there that we want to mitigate against and so that weve chosen to just step away from some of those sorts of things matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then how much of a drag is that and how long will it continue thats my last one thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well i think its and we saw the card growth rate was about or so versus our sales area of about to so i think theres going to be some of that pressure in the third quarter or so matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc couple of just followups one on payments so trying to understand i know you said merchant you expect to get to highsingledigit whats happening with the when i look at the volumes merchant was only up year on year and thats the slowest volume growth weve seen in six quarters so why has despite all the techled initiatives which are great and the other areas that youre trying to indiscernible why has volume growth slowed so much and then what would cause that to turn around john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so i can talk to that vivek so on the merchant processing side you mentioned that the sales component was about or so in terms of where we saw some volume decreases has really had to do with travel particularly on the european side of things volumes were just lower for our clients in that particular area so thats really the focal point i think if you think about as we start to lap some of that sort of thing and samestore sales come in and that sort of thing thats where we expect the momentum in the second half of the year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay shifting gears youre talking about chargeoffs going to basis points in the second half delinquencies are down so that should help but your ci losses are running high despite the losses npls are running still up first a twopart question there where in ci are you seeing these losses which industry sectors and your overall chargeoff rate of basis points which categories do you expect would tick that up from where you are currently given the outlook for delinquencies coming down john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so on your twoparter ill take the ci question first first of all the increase there in chargeoff was really attributed to one unique or idiosyncratic loan that went through and that was an npa that we saw couple quarters ago that worked its way through we dont anticipate anything really in the ci book outside of that so that is something that were not concerned about on the rest of the chargeoffs if i think about just at a big picture on credit card as an example we did see a little bit of an increase in chargeoffs this quarter but given the delinquency as you just mentioned we would expect our chargeoffs in the first or the third and fourth quarter to look more like the first quarter and i think the balance of it will be more kind of in the commercial real estate office side of things so thats kind of the puts and takes to the chargeoff guide us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so you had one large loan written off but then what refilled that bucket john given that the npls actually ticked up not down in ci john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well yeah i mean i think its very its just very modest its more idiosyncratic type loans its not something that were holistically concerned about at any reach andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp vivek as you mentioned and as john mentioned the delinquency levels are stable and so that drives stabilization on credit card the idiosyncratic loan that john mentioned it was in the second quarter and as we think about the future of that i think the lumpiness will come out of cre office and thats the one thats going to go up and down a little bit weve talked about that weve mentioned that in prior calls certainly manageable but that will just cause a little bit up and down vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp hey john john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning andy i appreciate the color you gave on capital and as you look at it i know it sounds like youre still on the sidelines on buybacks as you walk through your priorities and the expectation for capital here but i guess what changes that is it continued pulltopar on the aoci side is it basel iii clarity is it clarity on rates what gets you to the point where you get confidence in buyback outlook or how youre thinking about your internal cet1 target if you could just walk us through your thought process there us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah so lets start john by saying that im very confident in our capital levels and our ability to accrete capital its consistent with what weve talked about that basis points to basis points and weve made great improvements as you saw from the number basis points up over the last year so let me start there second as we talked about before we are seeking clarity on two components number one is ccar which we now have and number two is basel iii endgame which were getting closer to and my expectation john is that we will one way or the other well have more clarity if not the perfect answer we will update on both our capital targets and distribution objectives as we think about it at investor day on september so ill give you a full update at that point john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks appreciate that and then separately on operating leverage i know you reiterated your confidence in achieving positive operating leverage in the second half of this year i mean can you help us i know youre not giving formal expectations but im trying to think about what that positive operating leverage youre generating in the back half for that expectation what that could mean as we look into the quarters through i mean it looks like incentives is ballparking around basis points positive operating leverage when you look at fullyear expectations you were above basis points in but in the years prior you were well below that whats a good way to think about it medium term in terms of where usb should be operating from that standpoint andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp let me do it in components so first of all as you saw this quarter our expenses were relatively flat and we focused on the billion or lower for the fullyear so we are past the point of investment in the curve on increasing expenses and now realizing the benefits from those expenses so i would expect us to be moderate from an expense growth standpoint going forward and managing that well we talked about the momentum in fee growth and i would expect that to continue given the unique businesses we have i think the biggest difference is the headwind that was net interest income turned into a tailwind this quarter and as we talked about stabilization in the third quarter i think as we get into that becomes more of a tailwind and those things all drive positive operating leverage into john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of chris kotowski with oppenheimer please go ahead your line is open us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning its andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp hey chris chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc hi its a small item but a curiosity to me i mean i noticed that your automobile loan portfolio is down by more than yearoveryear and im just curious how did that category suddenly become a like nofly zone because youd think that shortduration assets youd think it would be attractive given the john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure sure chris so in terms of the drop obviously we havent been as active in the auto loan market just simply because the spreads and the returns on those sorts of loans have not been at our standard and the competitors that were facing arent banks and they have a different return profile in this particular environment that doesnt mean weve exited or anything like that in fact weve been very strong in terms of some of the leasing and some of the other areas and we continue to monitor that market very closely and if the spreads and returns are appropriate we will be very active in that space just as we have been in the past chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay all right thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with hsbc please go ahead your line is open saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good morning guys john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning saul saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 just a followup on the cards growth year on year credit up i guess john is that entirely due to the exiting or the reducing of exposure to prepaid or are you seeing any weakness in debit as well because that would be somewhat unusual typically debit in an environment where there is an economic slowdown tends to outperform so just any additional color there and just wanted to reaffirm that this is sort of a transitory thing and you should lap this and i suspect in the fourth quarter did i get that right john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i think to answer your question there very simply the difference between the fee growth versus the sales is really all prepaid on that side of things we see strong trends in terms of credit card spend and all the union penetration all the things that i mentioned those are the things and all the different partnerships that we have those are all still very good its just that its all on the prepaid side saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay go got it and then just a followup on deposit dynamics youve talked a few times about a slowing in the rotation but if i look at periodend noninterestbearing it did fall close to sequentially much different much worse than or much larger sequential decline than you see on average just anything there that you want to call out what drove that and is it something thats somewhat transitory or not andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp i want to thats thanks for asking that question because i want to point something out we have a lot of volatility in the daytoday nib deposit levels principally due to our corporate trust business that has payments coming in and out on a daily basis and depending upon where the quarter ends the holidays the end of the week the end of the month you could have volatility so we are very focused on the average balances and i would encourage you to do the same because day to day could be very volatile and it does not indicate any trends saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc got it all right thanks very much andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator and our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi during the last quarter theres been a few management changes people leaving people getting repositioned and i think as we get ready for the september investor day we might look at the presenters and say wow these are a lot different than the presenters at your last investor day so im just trying to figure out what the tea leaves are saying and maybe you can just tell us directly andy in terms of what is your time horizon for us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 remaining ceo i only ask that given some of these recent changes so and who are the contenders to be the next ceo of us bancorp and would you consider looking outside of us bancorp for your successor just little more color on all these moves that have taken place thanks andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike so as it relates to investor day youre going to see some new faces for sure but youre going to see some familiar faces as well so well have a good mix of both people that youre very familiar with as far as and some new one of the things that we made a change with was putting gunjan in the presidents role and about a yearand ahalf ago we combined what was then called wsib which is the or we combined the institutional wealth group together with the corporate and commercial group and the synergies and the activity and the customer focus that evolved from that was just terrific so gunjan has that same objective to do that with the entire bank with the payments organization with the consumer and business banking organization and pulling together the leadership the businesses under one leader with the customer in the center and really taking advantage of all the diverse set of businesses that we have to really grow the business thats the objective and shes done a terrific job with that already shes already started very fast to do it with the entire bank and im looking forward to sharing that story on september mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and the departures anything related to that is that yeah andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp no yeah mike i would just say thats natural activity weve had a very stable senior leadership group for years and years and sometimes change happens but theres no messaging in that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so the theme not to frontrun your conference too much is its one usb so youve done more one usb with wealth and commercial and now youre looking to be one usb deliver the whole firm to the client that sort of simple statement thats easy to say tough to execute andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp exactly mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 thanks mike operator and your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys i just had a followup on the securities book just can you help us understand the meaningful increase that happened this quarter in the yields and then also you mentioned of the bond book is floating is that the total bond book and then can you help us understand how much of that book is swapped and what you do with that going forward given the rate outlook thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so on the securities book in terms of the quarter the basis point increase a majority of that was related to opportunistically taking some of the excess liquidity that we had and putting into the securities book and so you can think of that as short data treasuries or treasury swap to floating that sort of thing which is the equivalent from an interest rate risk perspective versus cash is just a kind of a simple way to think about it in terms of the book itself i would say that i made that comment because about in terms of the afs risk and all that sort of thing we have hedged approximately or so of the risk component and then that coupled with just natural floating rate securities that we have within the book that are already floating that gets you to about that are either floating or synthetically floating through swaps so thats kind of the details of it now on the other side of that we have put on hedges to put receipt fixed swaps on our corporate book so that if rates do fall were protected on that end as well so those are kind of the balances all in it gets us to where we want to be from an interest rate risk standpoint which is neutral to shocks which is where we are today ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc so just when youre saying that that gets you to around half of the total book afs and htm john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yes thats correct ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay cool and sorry just one last one under billion for cost after the second quarter result can you just remind us what that means for the trajectory from here and thanks again for followups john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah billion or less thats our fee or excuse me thats our expense outlook where we have been over the last couple quarters is very consistent with where were at as andy talked about we hit that point on the investment curve we continue to feel like were in a very good spot in terms of managing expense going forward us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks ken john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator and we have no further questions in our queue at this time mr andersen i turn the call back over to you george andersen directorinvestor relations
