dorothy good morning everyone old national announced several strategic actions today including a new strategic plan the consolidation of or of our branches across our footprint and two capital actions including raising our dividend and authorizing a new share repurchase program as ive mentioned on prior calls we spent the last year internally focused and ive challenged our executive team to think about ways we can better serve our clients our team members our communities and importantly our old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 shareholders this new strategic plan is called the onb way ill share more details later in my remarks but some of the initial charges related to implementation are included in our fourth quarter earnings starting with slide our fourth quarter net income was million including million in charges from the onb way as well as merger charges adjusted net income was higher at million as you review our results youll see that our core margin was stable despite the fed fund rate cut in september and october and a challenging yield curve credit quality remained strong we recorded million of provision on net chargeoffs of million the higher net chargeoffs were primarily a result of a single credit that was previously reserved for prior quarters nonaccrual loans declined nicely in the quarter and yearoveryear as i have said in prior quarters while our credit quality is strong were not immune from losses were still watching a small number of credits but im not losing sleep over credit today we saw record commercial production for the quarter and strong core deposit growth importantly we also effectively managed our costs of total deposits lower by basis points to basis points and we posted strong yearoveryear operating leverage and efficiency ratio improvements next on slide fullyear net income was million including million in charges for the onb way and merger charges adjusted net income was almost higher yearoveryear like the quarter we saw record commercial production for the year and our pipeline was a record setting billion at yearend we also produced a record billion in mortgage loans of which approximately was sold in the secondary market we posted strong yearoveryear adjusted operating leverage improvements of basis points and adjusted efficiency ratio improvements of basis points adjusted return on average assets was and adjusted return on tangible common equity was on the capital front we repurchased million shares during the year at an average price of moving to slide despite the repurchases tangible book value per share grew by yearoveryear and tangible common equity to assets stood at a strong at yearend as i said in the beginning of the call we announced two capital actions including a increase in our quarterly dividend to per share which represents an approximately dividend yield we also announced a new share repurchase program of million shares which we expect to be opportunistic about over the next year a quick update on ma our strategy hasnt changed we remain an active looker and a selective buyer we are patient and continue to wait for the perfect pitch while remaining focused on execution given the importance of the onb way the hurdle will be even higher as we work on achieving our milestones and completing our initiatives next brendon is going to walk through this quarters details brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you jim turning to the quarter on slide our gaap earnings per share was and our adjusted earnings per share was adjusted earnings per share excludes million in onb way related charges in merger related charges as well as in debt securities gains moving to slide our quarterly adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue was higher yearoveryear and up a notable for the full year this result was driven by increased scale from our recent minnesota partnership our strong lowcost deposit base and a continued focus on expense management we also improved operating leverage by a strong basis points yearoveryear old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 slide shows the trend in outstanding loans as jim referenced our commercial loan production of million was the largest in our companys history we ended the quarter with a record billion pipeline and good momentum heading into persistently high levels of prepayments has held commercial outstandings flat despite our third consecutive quarter of record production as expected september and october rate cuts drove loan portfolio yields excluding accretion down basis points in the fourth quarter production yields in the fourth quarter were which reflects the lower longterm rate environment that we expect will continue to put pressure on asset yields moving to slide both periodend and average deposits increased during the quarter our total cost of deposits declined basis points quarteroverquarter to a very low basis points we are pleased with the results of our deposit pricing strategy that has resulted in a meaningful reduction in deposit costs while simultaneously growing our core deposit base with a little over billion in deposits indexed to fed funds and proactive management of our exception price book we are confident our ability to manage deposit costs lower in response to any future fed action slide shows our fourth quarter earning asset mix and quarteroverquarter change in loan mix although our efforts have been impacted somewhat by prepayments we remain focused on remixing the loan portfolio towards more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans and out of indirect and other loans the investment portfolio yield was down basis points quarteroverquarter to which was equal to the fourth quarter yield on new purchases next on slide youll see the detailed changes in our fourth quarter net interest income and corresponding margin we are pleased with the performance of our margin given the challenges of the interest rate environment net interest margin excluding accretion was better than expected at compared to last quarter the anticipated decline in earning asset yields which were down basis points was nearly offset by reductions in our funding costs active repricing of our deposit book and strong noninterest bearing deposit growth help mitigate the negative impact on asset yields that resulted from the recent fed rate cuts our ongoing work to reposition the balance sheet to a more neutral interest rate risk position along with continued thoughtful and disciplined approach to deposit pricing should allow us to defend our margin well against the stubbornly flat yield curve slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income our fourth quarter noninterest income decreased million following a strong third quarter performance that included record capital markets revenue and million in annual vendor incentives the quarteroverquarter change was a result of a seasonal decline in mortgage banking revenue and a return to trend line of our capital markets revenue also included on the slide is a summary of our mortgage activity for the quarter which included a record million in production low interest rates continue to support strong refi activity which accounted for of our production next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which reflects our ongoing focus on expense management we did experience an uptick in adjusted expenses in q4 driven by additional incentive compensation accruals related to record loan production and our full year earnings performance our adjusted efficiency ratio for the full year is a record low of and represents a basis point improvement over expense discipline is an important part of our culture and despite the revenue headwinds impacting the industry we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage slide has our credit metrics credit conditions remain benign as we experienced positive migration during the quarter and both nonperforming and underperforming loans fell to new cycle lows we recorded million in old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 provision expense during the fourth quarter while posting net chargeoffs of million the increase in net chargeoffs was driven by a single credit that had been fully reserved for in prior quarters our higher level of non performing loans relative to peers reflects our practice of identifying credit challenges early we believe early recognition of underperforming credits and active engagement with borrowers ultimately leads to lower credit losses as demonstrated by our below average chargeoffs slide demonstrates our strong reserve coverage and lowrisk balance sheet with basis points of reserves against organic loans and basis points in loan market against the acquired loans we believe that we have adequate reserve coverage before we turn away from credit we want to provide you with an update on our transition to cecl our estimated increased reallowance remained unchanged at million to million a large portion of the increase is related to the establishment of an allowance for billion of acquired loans with relatively modest increases in reserves on the remaining legacy book the relatively wide range reflects the uncertainty of future macroeconomic forecasts but assuming economic conditions remain stable we would expect to be in the bottom half of this range slide provides some key takeaways from our fourth quarter performance we are pleased with our results driven by good execution against our strategic objectives we successfully defended our core margin which showed only a basis point decline for prior quarter commercial loan activity remained strong with three consecutive quarters of record production and a record pipeline heading into the basis point yearover year improvement in adjusted operating leverage and the basis point improvement in our adjusted efficiency ratio demonstrates the benefits of our increased scale and continued focus on expense management slide includes thoughts on fourth quarter starting points and our outlook for we expect commercial loan production to remain strong based on both the size and quality of our pipeline we expect core net interest margin to be under some pressure from the shape of the yield curve as the slide suggests fees and expenses should follow normal seasonal patterns and we remain very focused on continuing to drive positive operating leverage our full year tax rate is expected to be approximately on an fte basis and on a gaap basis the effective tax rate includes an estimated million in tax credits primarily related to historic tax credit projects expected to be completed this year these projects are anticipated to generate an estimated million in tax credit amortization which will flow through the operating expenses please include the million in operating expenses in your model along with a reduced effective tax rate the after tax benefit of these projects is estimated to be approximate million in as a reminder the tax credit amortization is recognized through expenses in the quarter that corresponds with the place and service date while the tax benefit is spread over the full year through the tax line i will now turn the call back over to jim ryan to share some additional details on our onb way strategic plan james c ryan iii chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks brendon turning to slide i want to share some details on the onb way in may we started with a performance improvement diagnostic to define our goforward strategy and identify revenue and efficiency opportunities across the bank in august of we set out to build a bankable plan that was to deliver three key objectives first transform old national to a leading commercially oriented regional bank with a distinctive client centric value proposition delivered through a client segment focused organization old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 secondly lay the foundation to be a top performing independent bank by streamlining our operating model and strengthening our risk and credit processes to provide a seamless client experience thirdly improve our operating leverage invest in our operational it infrastructure to meet our clients where they are and ensure that were keeping pace with technology and client digital expectation through a balanced portfolio of revenue and cost initiatives to help us deliver top quartile performance we have now entered the implementation phase to capture the value identified in the design phase we have over milestones with total initiatives we anticipate the execution lasting one to two years weve communicated the impacts for the onb way changes to our team members last week including the branch consolidations we plan to also hold an investor day on may in indianapolis to provide more details and share updates on our progress moving to slide let me share our vision for the onb way well be a leading commerciallyoriented regional bank with a distinctive clientcentric value proposition based on strong relationships a streamlined operating model an exceptional work environment that empowers our team members to deliver their best moving to slide let me share some key organizational structure changes for the onb way historically old national has been organized by geography that model served us well for years but as weve grown through partnerships and our clients have become more diverse we saw the need to move from a generalist to more specialist relationship management approach to better serve our client needs as a result were moving to three main client segmentations the first is the commercial segment which includes segments based on clients revenue size and approved treasury and management offering and some dedicated units for specialized lending in select industry verticals this segment is being led by one of our most successful commercial leaders dennis heishman who started our louisville kentucky office more than years ago dennis will lead this segment from louisville a key new hire reporting to dennis is malinda anthony who recently joined us from wells fargo to lead our treasury management team she leads the tm team from indianapolis the second segment is community banking that will provide products and services tailored to each market serving personal small business clients through a full range of distribution channels to meet clients where they are this segment is being led by todd clark who was the president of united bank trust and was most recently our cio todd will lead this segment from michigan were creating a new wealth group for the third segment that combines our existing wealth management trust businesses our investment group and our private banking teams for a simplified private bankerled approach with an emphasis on financial planning this new wealth segment will be led by chady alahmar who will join old national later this month from us bank he will be leading this segment from minneapolis i also want to note that daryl moore will continue to lead our credit risk functions and continue to partner with our new segment leaders our main support areas including risk management operations finance and it functions will align with these client segments this approach will align complexity with the amount of risk taken in each of our segments leading to an overall better client experience improved cycle times and enhanced efficiencies we also announced today the hiring of paul kilroy to be our new cio joining us from huntington bank huntington national bank and scott fecteau to lead our operations who most recently worked at accenture please refer to our press release for more information about these key hires old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 on slide we provided some insights into the major initiatives of the onb way the expense savings will generate nearterm benefits but im more excited about the potential for the longer term revenue enhancements it will take most of to implement the revenue initiatives so we will not see any benefits this year we have initiatives in all three client segments we expect required investments in technology and talent to generate the anticipated revenue enhancements and well provide more details as the initiatives more fully materialize moving to slide we outline the timing of the real estate severance and professional onetime charges related to the expense savings initiatives the expense savings represent the net of any ongoing investments required to implement we expect total charges of million which weve already taken million in mostly related to professional fees the remaining million we expect to take this year with the bulk coming in the first quarter not including any benefits from the revenue initiatives the charges are earned back in approximately one and a half years by the end of we should be at a run rate of million annually but we expect the impact to be millionplus as we implement additional longer term opportunities in that are dependent on technology deployments thank you for allowing us extra time this quarter to provide the onb way strategy update and the whole team is available to take some questions thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning mr siefers r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hows everything going james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp fantastic r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good good just want to make sure i understand the expense opportunities on slide and jim i think you said this but i just want to make sure im crystal clear all the if we look at the walk the million million million throughout and then the million in full year benefits those are all expenses which are net of revenue opportunities right so thats all in other words anticipated to drop to the bottom line is that the right way of looking at it old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yes theyre all expense savings opportunities which include any required investment to achieve those expense saving opportunities we havent included any revenue synergies this year primarily because theyll be de minimis this year but we expect the impact to really start achieving that in r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect so all right thats good news and then maybe just a separate question on sort of run rate stuff so the margin on a core basis came in better than i would have thought this quarter i know you mentioned in your prepared remarks or brendon did the shape of the yield curve being the fact that it would cause further compression but i guess im just thinking given that the compression wasnt as bad as appeared in the fourth quarter what the main puts and takes would really be as you look out going forward james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah ill maybe give you a high level overview and let brendon comment where i dont get it exactly right i mean given the shape of the yield curve loan yields are continuing to be under a little bit of pressure here we will continue to look for ways to offset that through deposit side but as our deposit costs have come so low its going to be hard to keep up with the changes in the yield curve those are really the puts and takes its just how much the yield curve continues to change and evolve and how much pressure that puts on continuing loan yields r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp hey jim i mean scott the only thing i might add to that just a reminder we still have a number of cds that will be maturing over the next year almost of our cds mature in oneyear about a third of those mature in q1 so theres some levers there we still have an exception a fixed exception price book that we can push on so we have some levers on the funding side that will continue to go after but its really around new production yields relative to our portfolio yields that will continue to put pressure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question jim i want to go back to the efficiency program just to make sure i understand it i think in your remarks you multiple times talked about operating leverage and you talked about the efficiency improvement the banks made over the last couple of years if im thinking kind of in terms of efficiency ratio youve been in the high somewhere to assuming the fed doesnt move and if kind of rates kind of are the equalizer here how do we think about this program in the context of efficiency is this a program to try to maintain efficiency at these levels or drive the efficiency ratio lower james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i think its all about the context right in which how much revenue pressure we have from lower margins from additional fed rate actions right i mean regardless of what the economic environment or interest rate environment was going to be this year we were going to accomplish this program for so many reasons right its the right program to do its the right evolution of our company this time on top of that it just happens to be a more challenging interest rate environment for the industry and so for us i hope ultimately will lead to operating improvement and efficiency ratio improvements but i really cant predict whats going to happen with interest rates this year and the shape of the yield curve continues to be frustrating all those things i think will help offset any impacts from a challenging rate environment but longterm the whole idea is to drive further operating improvements and efficiency ratio improvements christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp im sorry thats before the revenue impacts again i am more excited about what those potential revenue impacts look like for us starting in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great if i could just add one more jim james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc you guys have historically kept expense growth ator below inflation just trying to tack it from a different angle the million that youre talking about for is im just trying to help as a kind of ballpark for a run rate of old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 dollars because i think its a big wildcard is the expectation that your core expenses would be down in relative to as you kind of hit full steam or is this a way to combat some of the inflationary technology investments and stuff like that im just trying to get a ballpark of where the expense growth rate will be james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i mean weve done a pretty good job of like say keep expenses below inflation well continue to do that obviously well benefit in versus in terms of additional expense saving dollars we dont think you guys have the expenses too far off in the model when you adjust for the onb way you adjust for the tax credit amortization that brendon talked about ph feel like the expenses you guys have at consensus makes sense to us but again i would also point out and well provide further updates in may but these revenue initiatives do require new people some additional technology and so therell be some expenses related to that but on a net basis it should all improve the bottom line and improve the operating leverage of the company christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and so that expense that youre referring to in consensus so if i look at consensus expenses youre saying with this announcement you feel good about that or with this announcement you should do better than the consensus number james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp im saying in the expense number seems to be on the right trajectory of where we think minus those adjustments we just talked about christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp and our goal is to again further drive improved operating leverage and so well continue to watch expenses and yearoveryear from to sic to our expenses should be better christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful thanks operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning sorry to have to start with a cecl question but im going to as you transition the billion of acquired loans from call it a pci world to a pcd world there should be an impact to net interest income and im just not sure if youve yet quantified what that impact would be and if so kind of discuss maybe your high level thoughts on cecl and thanks for the reserve disclosure but more so on the nii impact brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah terry its brendon we dont have a lot of accretion impact related to that movement its a relatively small bucket the marks on those shouldnt have a huge material impact to our going run rate around accretion we calculate that and its relatively small i think other institutions might have a slightly larger impact than us around that number terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then the reserves on acquired loans that percentage im guessing is higher than the core portfolio so my question is as we move forward and the acquired loans continue to come down should the reserve ratio to total loan should that come down as well brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp so if you take the billion which youre right terry does have a higher mix of commercial so the general impact for cecl might be a slightly higher reserve but that is embedded in that million to million range that we provided so if you take that and add it to our current reserve that should give you a pretty good idea of what the reserve level will be going forward and then itll all depend provisioning will all depend on sort of the mix of our production ph having in theory production will be a little higher mortgage will be a little lower terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then a question for jim if i think about what bob did at old national moved from a community bank to a super community bank today we are talking about moving from that super community bank to a regional bank i guess what were some of the risks that you discussed internally as it relates to what this could mean to the commercial bank and the community bank as well given that their very strong deposit base that comes through the community bank james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah let me first start with at our heart we are a community bank we continue to be involved in our communities we think were better at it than most banks are in terms of how we continue to support our communities and how we continue to serve our clients so that really doesnt change regardless of the onb way having said that as we get bigger and our clients are more diverse and were more spread farther apart we recognize the need that our platform maybe wasnt as scalable as it was under that more geographycentric structure it was hard for jim to tack on another region with another ceo so more presence on top of that that old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 became more challenging for us so we think this new structure weve broken the company up into three primary segments to face off with clients and then support that with our operations and it and finance functions all makes a lot of sense to us and we think this is pretty typical of banks our size when they get to this point where they have to think about the evolution of its structure im also really excited about some of the talent were able to bring to the organization when were out telling our story whether its to individual relationship managers in markets or whether its to senior leaders in our company people are pretty excited about the story here at old national and they see this as a place for them being successful and i think this organizational structure helps us support that and then were also obviously able to generate a savings that were reinvesting back in ourselves in better technology to make the organization more efficient but also improve our client offering so i think this is just a natural evolution for where old nationals been over its years but i also think that makes the platform more scalable for us going forward terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great thanks everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good question terry operator we have a followup question from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp mr siefers r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks for taking the followup just want to drill down into the expense base in the fourth quarter of for a bit came in a little higher than i had anticipated and you guys called out the incentive comp for example how much of that ends up indeed being transitory in other words comes kind of immediately back down and how much is this sort of a if at all is the higher sort of structural level indiscernible james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp sure brendon will walk you through the changes brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes yes scott most of that million would walk right back down in the first quarter what youll see though is then well be adding in payroll taxes and then merit in the second quarter as jim mentioned earlier we feel pretty good around the consensus estimate excluding the onb way initiatives that are out there for the fullyear of old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 if you back off the million we expect in related to onb way and then adjust for the million in tax credit amortization that gets you to a pretty good view of how were looking at expenses next year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then just on the tax credit amortization i could be mistaken but i thought we were sort of stepping back from that business and the next year will be much bigger what are sort of the dynamics around that brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah were not stepping back in that business but there is a certain type of federal historic tax credit thats a one year deal that creates this kind of volatility that were talking about today we have a handful of credits that were originated some time ago that will be running through this year this is the last of these tax credits theyre no longer available to be done going forward so this is the last of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp scott these are projects that were working on for theres a long runway for these projects and these projects were the last of those projects and quite frankly the last of the one year that were even eligible to be done so we hope through this fund structure as we talked about before will create less volatility that fund continues to get bigger but these are the last of those kind of one year deals that unfortunately we just have to push through with this accounting r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay that makes sense thank you and then just in terms of how the impacts will flow through throughout is that going to be kind of evenly through the year or will there be lumpiness james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good question a bulk of that actually comes in the first half of the year but again these are historic deals so you have to get certificates of occupancy and things like that and so those things could there could be some timing push from to but think of bulk of that stuff to happen in the first half of the year but again the tax rate effect is a full year tax effect r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 but a bulk of the expenses actually come through when they get ph displaced into service and we think thats going to be in the first half of the year with a little bit tailing in the third quarter and fourth quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good question scott thanks operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of kevin swanson with hovde group james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp hi kevin kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc hi guys james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc good morning i appreciate the comments on ma but i was just curious on your thoughts around some of the larger community bank and regionals teaming up through moes and kind of the transactions being generally more accepted brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i think theres a little bit of a mixed track record here on some of those transactions and we continue to look at all forms of ma as you would expect us to do and for us plan a is continue to do the types of deals weve done which is to continue to expand our footprint build scale in existing footprint try and drive efficiencies out of that scale that would be plan a but as you would imagine our board looks at all types of transactions and well continue to look at those opportunities as they evolve but as i said earlier i mean those any transaction has a higher hurdle today given our focus on needing to achieve the initiatives and milestones embedded within the onb way kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc most of my other questions are answered but maybe just one more it looked like endofperiod basis indirect increased a little bit this quarter was that just a timing issue or is there a change in the thought on that portfolio old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah no change in thought that portfolio ebbs and flows and sometimes you have more rundown than others it just happened to be a little bit higher production on a net basis kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc okay great thanks guys james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah thanks operator we have a followup question from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yes sir christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks jim just to make sure im clear on the expenses slide where you give the onetime charges for and also the recurring benefit brendon was your comment that youre comfortable with consensus i think you said excluding the indiscernible and the implementation charges or is it including the what it looks like million a little over million of benefit just trying to get a sense of brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp were comfortable with the consensus kind of on a standalone basis and then you can add in the impact on slide plus the tax credit amortization is that clear christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so comfortable with consensus but then if you hit the million million million million per quarter we would need to reduce expenses by that amount is that what youre saying brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes you take that expense line and then you can subtract the consensus estimates and then you can subtract the full year million benefit from onb way christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so youre comfortable with where it was prior to the announcement old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah exactly christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc announcement help us out brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp exactly christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great all right thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national
