chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 thanks jen and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call after terry and i finish our prepared remarks terry jodi mark and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the first quarter we reported earnings per share of our performance this quarter was adversely impacted by the covid19 in the us and global economies the stay at home orders across the country while necessary and temporary are significantly restricting economic activity consumers and businesses are dealing with the fallout which is affecting sentiment and business activity and resulting in financial distress for many these dynamics are affecting the banking industry in a number of ways and our first quarter results were reflective of these developing economic conditions we saw strong loan growth and related deposit growth particularly in the last few weeks of the quarter as we supported our customers liquidity needs during this timeframe the company funded approximately billion of loans for our customers while continuing to strengthen our cash position our fee businesses were affected to varying degrees our payments businesses were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in both consumer and commercial spend activity in line with the drop in global economic activity in march demonstrating the importance of having a welldiversified business mix mortgage revenue growth was strong this quarter as the decline in interest rates allowed many more consumers to refinance their mortgage at more attractive terms we also saw strong growth in our commercial products revenue reflecting robust capital markets activity nonperforming assets started to trend higher in the first quarter reflecting the increased economic stress we increased our allowance for loan losses in response to the current economic conditions and as you can see in the lower right quadrant of this slide we remain wellcapitalized book value per share grew compared with a year ago slide provides key performance metrics we delivered a return on tangible common equity in the first quarter impacted by lower earnings due to the current economic environment slide shows our continually improving digital uptake trends the significant investments weve made in our digital capabilities over the last several years are helping our customers continue to do banking as social distancing has become more widespread because of our agile development activities weve made a number of updates in recent weeks to digital tools and processes to help customers who choose to bank at home weve added the ability to accept treasury checks via mobile check deposit which will help customers more quickly and seamlessly get access to funds being distributed through the government stimulus efforts our teams worked quickly to design and deploy a new digital forbearance tool within a week of this feature being launched more than of all customers requesting forbearance were doing so in a digital way digital is a core part of our strategy and well continue to look for innovative ways to help our customers bank from home and to meet financial goals through this social distancing period and beyond now ill turn the call over to terry wholl provide more color on the quarter terry terrance r dolan vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends average loans grew on a linked quarter basis and increased yearoveryear linked quarter growth was primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and mortgage loans business customers drew us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 down lines to support business activity toward the end of the quarter to support future liquidity requirements strong residential mortgage loan growth reflected the low interest rate environment on a period end basis loans increased billion or linkedquarter and yearoveryear turning to slide average deposits increased on a linked quarter basis and grew yearoveryear average savings deposits increased yearoveryear driven by growth in wealth management and investment services corporate and commercial banking and consumer and business banking on a period end basis deposits increased billion or linked quarter and yearoveryear turning to slide while the net chargeoff ratio was relatively stable on both a linked quarter and yearoveryear basis nonperforming assets increased sequentially reflecting recent economic stress we have taken a proactive approach to evaluating risk ratings across the entire commercial loan portfolio and considered the risk rating changes in the evaluation of our allowance for credit losses our credit loss provision was million in the first quarter reflective of million of net chargeoffs and a reserve build of million the increase in the reserve was related to changes in risk ratings and deterioration in economic conditions driven by the impact of covid19 on the us and global economies and our expectation that credit losses and nonperforming assets will increase from current levels the increase in the allowance for credit losses has considered our best estimate of the impact of significantly slower economic growth and higher unemployment partially offset by the benefits of government stimulus programs as of march slide highlights our key underwriting metrics and exposures to certain atrisk segments given the current environment we have a strong relationshipbased credit culture at us bank supported by cash flowbased lending that considers sensitivity to stress proactive management and portfolio diversification which allows us to support growth through the economic cycle and produce consistent results however while actual credit quality results will depend on the duration of the covid19 situation the impact of shelter in place orders on consumer and business activity as well as the extent of the benefit of government stimulus programs it is likely that changes in risk ratings and net chargeoffs will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as credit conditions change slide provides an earnings summary in the first quarter of we reported per share turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by yearoveryear in line with our expectations as the impact of declining rates and a flatter yield curve was partially offset by deposit and funding mix loan growth and one additional day the net interest margin declined by basis point versus the fourth quarter the lower margin reflected lower interest rates and a flatter yield curve as well as approximately basis points of drag due to intentionally higher cash balances being maintained for liquidity to accommodate customer demand these factors were mostly offset by beneficial shifts in loan and deposit mix we expect to see more pressure on our net interest margin in the second quarter primarily due to the timing and extent of changes in interest rates late in the first quarter the significant buildup in liquidity to support the significant loan growth or loan demand being experienced changes in loan mix and the impact of floors on deposit pricing slide highlights trends in noninterest income which came in higher than we expected primarily due to better than expected mortgage banking results and strong fixed income capital markets activities compared with the first quarter a year ago higher mortgage production and stronger gain on sale margins were partially offset by changes in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activity us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 slide provides information about our payment services business lines including exposures to impacted industries in the first quarter payment services revenue declined on a yearoveryear basis reflecting lower corporate payment products revenue and lower merchant acquiring revenue driven by significantly lower sales volume in march as shelter in place orders impacted many of our customers within the merchant acquiring business sales volumes declined between and on a yearoveryear basis in the second half of march compared with an increase in the mid to high single digits in the first two months of the quarter within our corporate payments business commercial sales volumes declined between and in late march due to the worldwide impact of the economic slowdown on business spend activity government sales volumes declined between to in late march the government business accounts for about of the total corporate payments revenue commercial products revenue benefited from higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue partly offset by credit valuation losses related to the customer derivative portfolio the valuation losses reflect hedging effectiveness given the significant volatility in the markets during the first quarter and changes to credit risk ratings of customers it is likely that mortgage production will continue to be relatively strong in the nearterm but may begin to slow later in the year in line with the trend in the refinancing activity payments revenue is likely to be adversely affected through the remainder of the year reflecting significant declines in consumer and business spend activity trust and investment revenue will likely decline from first quarter levels due to recent trends in the equity markets turning to slide sic slide noninterest expense increased yearoveryear reflecting business investment including digital capabilities as well as higher revenuerelated expenses of approximately million related to mortgage production and capital markets activities additionally we incurred incremental covid19 related costs of approximately million principally related to increasing liabilities for potential future delivery claims related to the airline industry and other merchants but also including expenses related to premium pay for frontline workers and expenses tied to providing a safe working environment for our employees slide sic slide highlights our capital position at march our common equity tier capital ratio reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit loss accounting methodology was our common equity tier capital ratio calculated in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the current expected credit loss methodology implementation at march was ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry the banking industry is operating in a challenging environment and we are not immune from the economic stress brought on by the covid19 pandemic however im confident that well manage through this difficult period just as we managed through difficult periods in the past our balance sheet is strong our businesses are diverse and our culture has proven to be a differentiating factor over time and perhaps especially during adverse situations the interest rate environment is not ideal but we view it as manageable and we will continue to benefit from our strong core deposit base our reputation as a flight to quality bank and our bestin class debt rating on a global basis an economic downturn will mean higher credit costs for the entire industry but we have a strong track record and its at times like this when portfolio diversity and disciplined and consistent underwriting really pay off us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 its unclear at this point how the situation will develop or how long it will be until the economy opens up and when well start to rebound however our strong capital position and ample liquidity give us the ability to weather even a severe downturn we recently suspended our share buyback program to give us more flexibility we are continually evaluating potential scenarios and we believe that even if an economic downturn persisted through most of the year we would be able to maintain our dividend in its current level i believe we will emerge from this stronger on the other side but in the meantime we are intently focused on doing what we can for our customers communities and employees as they deal with their unique situations we stand ready with the necessary liquidity to support the significant loan demand we expect to see in the coming weeks as the government continues to rollout facilities to support businesses such as the small business administration paycheck protection program and the main street lending program we made adjustments to certain consumer and small business lending products and services to make them more affordable and accessible to existing customers who may be experiencing financial stress we also raised mobile check deposit limits for many customers using our mobile app recognizing the precarious situation many of our communities are in we announced a number of initiatives including a million new and redirected investments million of which are to local nonprofits across the country to continue to support individuals and families with financial education affordable housing and work assistance weve taken a number of steps to support and protect our employees within a short period of time we have transitioned of our employees to be able to work from the safety of their home we announced a premium pay program to provide officecritical frontline employees a hourly wage increase during the shelter in place conditions we also expanded our flexible leave policies and were keeping our employees safe with personal protection equipment at our customerfacing sites i want to end this call by saying thank you to all our employees those working from home and those on the frontlines im proud of the way youve come together and the work you are doing to partner with and support all of our constituents in this very difficult time well now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thanks for your comments on credit and were wondering as we think about the companyrun dfast results so cumulative losses over nine quarters could you talk about how you think this recession would look like relative to that stress whats different for the better for the positive and whats worse for the negative clearly the unemployment rate is was capped at in the dfast result and also with the reserve at youve told us before that cecl is very procyclical and from here im wondering how much more reserve build we could potentially see terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah erika thank you very much so let me try to address maybe the dfast questions first and when we end up thinking about the allowance maybe at current state relative to the losses that were experiencing we think that the coverage ratio associated with that is relatively strong that is over kind of a ninequarter period of time we have a lot of capacity with respect to our preprovision net revenue capability in terms of being able to produce that so we have the opportunity to be able to absorb a pretty substantial amount of losses if need to especially when you kind of think about where our capital level is and where it would need to progress before it becomes problematic so when we think about the coverage ratio sic when we think about the reserve from here on out i think that things will continue to progress and evolve and change how this recession i think is different clearly the rapid development of the situation in terms of the healthcare crisis the impacts obviously to people from an employment perspective and having to either work from home or being unemployed peaks pretty quickly as we think about it and certainly as we were thinking about the reserving process we took into consideration tried to take into consideration the rapid increase that would take place and then the impact that it would have on unemployment over a more sustained period of time before it starts to come down its hard to judge particularly right now because theres just a lot of moving parts i think the other thing that comes into play which is kind of difficult to get your arms around is the whole stimulus package i think the government put a lot of programs into place both to stabilize the markets quickly as well as to be able to bridge customers and businesses between now and when they are able to get back to employment and thats one of the things that will continue to play out over time but we do expect that the credit quality statistics related to nonperforming and delinquencies and things like that will continue to progress upward and well have to watch and manage it us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay got it the second question is i know this is another impossible question but given what happened to paymentsrelated revenues down yearoveryear but clearly a tale of two different points in the quarter what how should we expect this to progress and should we expect down double digits through at least the second quarter and what are increased liabilities driven by future delivery exposure that you noted were related to merchant and airline processing terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so one of the things we tried to do on slide is to give you a good sense in terms of both the percentage of revenue that our payments businesses represent as a percentage of the total revenue of the company as well as industries the mix of the industries that are more severely impacted so let me kind of break it down but i do believe at a high level when we think about and how were kind of stresstesting the next several quarters we do believe that second third and possibly through the end of the fourth quarter that consumer spend and business spend is going to be at relatively low levels so as were modeling and were thinking that for example merchant is going to continue to be down at to on a yearoveryear basis that cps is going to continue to be down in that to sort of range and that rps is probably going to continue to migrate downward its kind of in that to range today but i do think that it starts to migrate closer to that as well and as we are stresstesting and thinking about the future quarters thats how were thinking about it and its a function of the mix of the businesses so if you think about the merchant acquiring business we have about of the revenue from that business is directly tied to travel and hospitality and another is directly tied to retail and both of those businesses are pretty significantly impacted i mean airlines as an example being to down depending upon the week so its as we think about second third and even into the fourth quarter were stressing it down quite a bit erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and just a followup question on the terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah future delivery im sorry yeah future delivery so future delivery if you think about the airline industry we process transactions for the airline industry as well as some other merchants where customers are paying upfront for their ticket for a future travel or flight and the merchant kind of stands in between the merchant acquirer stands in between the customer that is buying that ticket and the airline that will provide that future service to that customer so to the extent that that airline is unable to provide it then the customer has the right to go back against the merchant acquirer now what ends up happening over time is and what has been happening is that exposure gets starts to dissipate and it dissipates when the airline either refunds the customer or the customer decides not to fly the flight or the airline provides future credit to that particular customer and so that future delivery risk to us continues to dissipate over time but we wanted to make sure and were required from an accounting standpoint to recognize the potential risk associated with that future delivery exposure and well continue to manage it us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and erika im just going to add a little bit im just going to add a little bit to terrys comments on the merchant card and corporate payments spend so if you think about the first quarter three months we really saw the stress in the last half of the last month so we sort of had a onesixth impact on the quarter on those payments businesses and what terry is telling you is that what we saw in those last two months of march in merchant and corporate and retail was a spend particularly in merchant down in that 50plus percent range now no one knows exactly when thats going to come back and what terry has indicated is were stresstesting it understanding that thats the impact we wanted to provide you detail but when it comes back is uncertain for sure but thats the impact and the exposure we would have terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and thats just to clarify thats spend not revenues terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp well its spend and revenues pretty closely tied to the same sort of trends and again as andy said it really is a function of when does the when do businesses relaunch when do people get back to work and what is the duration of this situation that is really hard to get your arms around but were stresstesting it based upon what i talked about erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache of nomura bill carcache q analyst instinet llc thank you good morning first terry i wanted to ask you a question followingup on your response to erikas question about expecting certain credit metrics like delinquencies to head higher from here if we think about cecl in theory its supposed to capture lifetime losses and so shouldnt that upward trajectory in delinquencies and losses already be contemplated into your allowance at and so just i guess wondering if you could help us understand what it will take to drive incremental reserve building versus from here versus whats already baked into that allowance us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so great question bill and so if you if we had perfect insight into exactly what was going to happen and we knew exactly how bad gdp and unemployment and everything else was going to get the cecl process would take that into consideration but as you know nobody has perfect insight in fact the expectations around unemployment and gdp and when people get back to work and all sorts of things are constantly changing so at any particular point in time we have to make our best estimate of what that forecast looks like knowing that its likely to continue to progress based upon how conditions change so if you end up when we go through that process we end up looking at things like moodys analytics and morgan stanley and goldman sachs just a whole variety of different and even over the course of the last seven days or so those projections with respect to how the economy is going to change and what the potential impacts might be has been pretty significant so were going to have to take all those things into consideration as part of that process and then of course the models are never perfect theres a lot of things that we have to take into consideration from a judgmental standpoint think about the impact of the stimulus package its really hard at this particular point in time to know exactly what the benefits are that are going to come into play etcetera so theres just a lot of different factors that we have to try to consider so we believe that its going to continue to evolve really over the next several quarters and thats going to impact the reserve build over time bill carcache q analyst instinet llc thats super helpful terry but i guess as we think about where you guys were in terms of like the economic forecast that you were using through lets say the end of march and the first quarter and then to the extent that new information became available early april before earnings that suggested that the rate of deterioration in unemployment and real gdp would be greater than what was thought at march is that information that it was still i guess it existed at the balance sheet date but you didnt find out about it until after would that be something that you contemplate in your allowance or is the allowance literally just based on information through 331or is there room for judgment there just trying to get a little bit of i guess sense of how that works terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well obviously we do try to take into consideration what we know and apply judgment with respect to what we think the trends are going to be but eventually you have to kind of snap the chalk line and say this is what were going to base our assessment on and we really have to do that right around the end of the quarter so as things change well have to take that into consideration the other thing in terms of the whole reserving process just maybe to kind of put some context around it so theres obviously a lot of judgment that kind of comes into play and you have to kind of come up with what your economic forecast is but as we think about it and the reserve at the end of the first quarter when we end up looking at the coverage ratios that we have in terms of chargeoffs and in terms of the overall loan book etcetera we feel like those coverage ratios are at least reasonable at this particular point in time also kind of keep in mind that at on day one we had to make certain judgments and assessments with respect to the amount of cecl adjustment at that particular point in time and to kind of give you some insight when we made that assessment of the economic forecast a little over of it we have shown would either be a slower growth environment a moderate recession or a severe recession us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 so there were lots of different views with respect to where the economy was going to go so we have taken some of that into consideration as part of kind of our day one and then its also very important to take into consideration where youre starting from and if you think about our portfolios in terms of determining the allowance our portfolios on the consumer side are principally prime or superprime sort of customers with very high fico scores and good coverage in terms of loantovalue ratios on the secured side of the equation and our commercial book of business tends to be high investment grade where we stress cash flows its based on cash flow ph and lending and the ability to be able to withstand so we start from good credit underwriting a good risk profile strong coverage ratios and all those things are taken into consideration in terms of our estimate of the allowance bill carcache q analyst instinet llc thats very helpful if i could squeeze one more in for andy andy you mentioned in the press release you commented on how usb is going to emerge stronger in the other side of the pandemic and proving a reliable partner to your customers in the i guess period when we think about the great recession there was you guys really used that as an opportunity to win relationships with new partners in part because you were in a stronger position versus many other banks as we think about where you guys stand today do you see opportunities for usb to differentiate itself in this environment or is it more difficult because the banks i guess generally speaking are coming into this downturn in a stronger position relative to the great recession andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think generally speaking all banks are in a good position right now which is why were all able to help our customers while protecting employees which is exactly what were focused on one of the other things i said is we have been stressing across all the dynamics margin fees all the things weve talked about as well as credit losses and importantly based on what i know today even if the economic downturn persisted through the most of the year we still believe we can maintain the dividend which is also an important factor for shareholders bill carcache q analyst instinet llc got it thank you for taking my questions operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of mike mayo of wells fargo q hi this is ph chris on behalf of mike this is just related to the questions you had previously how have i mean what is your view of the economy since the end of the third quarter and how has that changed just again i know you kind of addressed that to a degree but were just a little more specifics on what you think the economy has done over the last few weeks given what you saw at the end of march terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah again i think since the end of march i think there are a number of forecasts that have come out with respect to gdp declining dramatically particularly in the second quarter i think there are other forecasts that try to us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 take into consideration not only what i would call a vshaped sort of recovery but more of maybe a ushaped sort of recovery so the duration has changed a fair amount and then where unemployment either peaks or at least what level its sustained at over a period of time i think whether you look at moodys analytics or you look at reports that have come out from goldman sachs or jpmorgan since the end of the quarter most of those have started to at least incorporate downside risk related to the environment q okay and then on reserving just a couple of questions on the reserves for unused commitments and then also can you relate your reserve level today and the coverage ratio today versus what you might have seen during the global financial crisis because its much lower today and even with all the adjustments youve made and builds youve made since the gfc so just how has your portfolio changed that give you so much more confidence today in the coverage ratio versus what you might have had say eight or nine or years ago terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so i mean i think that and ill have maybe mark pipe in here a little bit but if you think about how our portfolios have changed since or certainly if you end up looking at on the consumer side of the equation i think across the industry and including ourselves the underwriting standards are tighter than they were back then certainly on the mortgage side if you think about the mortgage product it is underwritten to take into consideration a customers ability to manage cash flows even in different rate scenarios and rate environments et cetera on the commercial side of the equation i think the exposures related to leveraged lending and some of those sorts of things is different but mark could you kind of address that mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah i would just say in addition to what terry has mentioned like i said on the retail side or the consumer side the portfolio continues to be very strong i think were better positioned at this point of the economic cycle than we were going into the last downturn the quality of the portfolio in terms of the average borrower profile from a credit perspective is stronger the loantovalues are lower especially on the real estate portfolios that would be true as well with our auto portfolio both loan and lease is stronger today as well as our credit card portfolio so we feel good with the quality of the portfolio as terry said is very much prime on the commercial side it continues to be pretty much investment grade or equivalent as you know we capitalized during the last downturn to really what i would say is or move towards a large corporate strategy and with that weve got higher quality borrowers today than we had going into the last downturn which has provided some of the funding of that billion and some of the draws that we talked about earlier and then the commercial real estate weve been in that business a long time and thats really relationshipbased and i would say weve really gone upmarket focused in on stronger sponsors today compared to where we were out of the last downturn i think from a credit quality perspective the portfolio is very strong as we enter into this changing economic environment terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah and then ph chris maybe one of the last things on the commercial real estate side of the equation for the last two years we have really been tightening the underwriting and bringing down our exposure with respect to construction lending and i think thats a pretty significant difference and we have been doing that us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 in contemplation that ultimately we had some form of a downturn and weve been relatively conservative associated with that if you end up looking at the peak one of the questions you had is really kind of in the last cycle kind of what sort of peaks did we see ultimately i think the reserve at that time ended up building to about of loans and the chargeoff rates ended up kind of increasing to about kind of overall so theres thats why i say i think when you end up looking at chargeoffs and some of these other statistics theyre going to continue to migrate but we have good strong if you end up looking at even the allowance today and while i said i think that in the future quarters its going to continue to build if you look at the allowance today in terms of coverage ratios relative to net chargeoffs nonperforming assets etcetera our coverage ratios are very strong q thank you but just a quick followup on that then so the slight decline in the allowance for commitments terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i think part of that is what commitments have now funded but what we try to do is to take into consideration from a reserving perspective what unfunded commitments exist out there and probabilities that they will become funded and then the loss rates that you have to apply to it but mark can you mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah and i would just say the unfunded commitments we also look at the credit quality of those borrowers and so what remains is some of the stronger quality borrowers on the balance sheet as well q thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja of jpmorgan terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry multiple calls a quick question just a question that i have for you is what and you may have already mentioned this with multiple calls so pardon me what reserves are you putting aside against credit card loans in your reserve build terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 so what your question is what are we reserving or taking into consideration with respect to credit cards themselves mark why dont you answer that mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah our reserve rate was at the end of q1 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks thats im presuming youve already given some detail which i have missed thanks so ill followup with ir about whether youve given any metrics on unemployment where youre expecting that to pan out next year where do you expect it to settle out did you already give that terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah we didnt talk about that in the modeling process as of the end of march we talked about the fact that this will continue to evolve and change as estimates change but in the modeling process we tried to take we considered a number of different forecasts ultimately in the high single digits between and and that it being sustained at a certain level for a period of time and then ultimately dissipating as we get into vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and i noticed you took a little bit of reserve for the merchant processing library is that your best estimate as to what you have to take or do you think that if this continues for a while thats more likely than the million you took terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah at this particular point in time we feel like thats a pretty good estimate of what we think the exposure is and again its a liability for what the exposure might be related to that future delivery in this particular area that exposure tends to dissipate again for a whole variety of different reasons including airlines making refunds them using their government stimulus programs in order to be able to do that customers choosing not to fly the flights or being given future credit by the airlines so that will dissipate it quite a bit and then the other thing you guys have to kind of keep in mind is for these airlines to relaunch they need a merchant acquirer and so from a prioritization perspective they want to make sure that their merchant acquirer is onboard and ready to go and so they tend to prioritize the resolution of those future delivery exposures to make sure that the merchant acquirer is helpful vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thank you terry terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yes us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey john rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc hi this is rahul patil here for john i just want to revisit the whole discussion around reserve level and cumulative loss so per your dfast result so you had billion of losses per the feds projections over nine quarters and i believe it was billion losses for your own model your reserve right now stands at around billion i just want to get a sense for what portion of that cumulative losses are you assuming right now when youre sizing up the current reserve level andor potential incremental reserve build in the coming quarters terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so i think youre trying to get at what do we think about dfast and how our reserve would kind of compare to dfast results and again that billion is pretty close to that estimate both by the fed as well as ourselves and that is really what sort of losses you would experience over a ninequarter period with pretty severe unemployment taking place and being sustained over a substantial amount of that time our allowance today represents just shy of of that and we certainly have the capacity both from a capital perspective as well as from an earnings perspective to be able to manage any losses that might be above that reserve level we dont necessarily as we think about it necessarily come up with a percentage of losses relative to dfast but i think the coverage is pretty strong at this particular point in time and again it will progress as the quarters go on rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc got it all right and then you said its billion of loans that youve modified is that mainly consumer loans or have you begun restructuring commercial loans as well mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp that would be both portfolios weve helped out a number of customers what i would say is those are programs or modifications that weve done kind of in the past on a forwardlooking view on the consumer portfolio over the last few weeks we have granted forbearance and extensions of about customers which is about of on and offbalance sheet exposure in addition weve helped business customers or about billion of total exposure as well so those would not be included in those restructured numbers that youre looking at rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc got it all right and then just one last question so im looking at your lcr disclosures as of year end where it seems like you assumed around billion of line drawdowns that compares to the billion that you cited today so just twopart question so what sort of stress scenario is baked into that lcr disclosure over a 30day period and how does that compare with the environment today and then secondly was there some impact to the us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 line drawdowns you saw in march due to window dressing by companies or do you expect another wave of drawdowns in the coming weeks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp the drawdowns were high in the third and fourth week of march and started to level out in early april so i think we saw the peak already occurring you broke up a little bit on your first question what was the question around december rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc yeah so basically i was just looking at your lcr disclosures where it seems like you were assuming billion to billion of drawdowns over a 30day stress period and im just wondering like what sort of stress scenario were you assuming in your lcr disclosures and how does that compare with the scenario that youre seeing today terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so theres actually two different tests theres lcr and theres kind of a liquidity stress test and with respect to the liquidity stress test the coverage ratios which arent disclosed are much higher than the lcr itself so under a stress scenario we have the liquidity and the ability to be able to manage that very effectively in terms of liquidity today right now we have about billion of cash that were maintaining thats kind of what were targeting and we have substantial kind of offbalance sheet liquidity whether that is through a variety of different lines and sources and then within the investment portfolio theres probably realistically about another billion that we could draw down if we had to so from a liquidity perspective even under pretty significant stress we feel pretty comfortable rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald of autonomous q hi there this is ph david smith filling in for john the figures you mentioned that youre modeling for payments merchant down to for the next few quarters and big drops in cps and rps also were those stress cases or are those your base case for now that youre modeling terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 well i think its probably base case for purposes of the second quarter so the nearterm and then when i talk about stresstesting its really trying to understand if the covid situation continues on into the third and fourth quarter what that would look like so i think nearterm thats kind of what we would expect until businesses start to recover and consumers kind of get back to full employment so to speak q thank you terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yes jennifer ann thompson a executive vice president directorinvestor
