the overwhelming outreach from individuals and organizations throughout the country your outpouring of love and care has helped strengthen us and we are so grateful turning to the quarter we reported strong first quarter earnings despite a rapid shift in the operating environment for all banks for old national it was business as usual even throughout march and the strength of our franchise remains evident in the results outlined on slide four adjusted eps was per common share with adjusted roa and roatce of and respectively our adjusted efficiency ratio remained under obviously deposits liquidity and credit are in focus today as you can see deposit balances were stable during the quarter despite the normal first quarter seasonal patterns and public fund balances our total cost of deposits at basis points is well below peers and we maintained our deposit pricing discipline with a low total deposit beta cycle todate granularity is one of the keys to success here and brendon will share some additional details on the competitive advantage our funding base provides later in the deck with respect to liquidity as youd expect we took steps to increase our cash on hand and our available liquidity over the course of march and april our liquidity coverage in excess of our uninsured deposits is including unencumbered assets likewise our credit remains strong with basis points of nonpcdrelated chargeoffs and stable asset quality we remain watchful like other banks and are focused on potential pockets of softness like our deposit portfolio our loan portfolio is granular which should continue to serve us well we remain confident in our client selection and underwriting and as you know old national has taken an active approach to credit management this approach has served us well in various economic cycles as evidenced this quarter we worked aggressively to address some pcd credit from the merger on the client side engagement remained high in the quarter and we continue to expect disciplined loan growth in albeit not at 2022s pace in other areas more the same the low peer deposit costs should drive a funding advantage more organic growth of our wealth management client base and a continued focus on disciplined expense management thank you i will now turn the call over to brendon to cover the quarter results in more detail brendon b falconer chief financial officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to the quarters results on slide we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings include million in pretax mergerrelated charges million in pretax property optimization charges as well as million in debt securities losses excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was slide provides our quarterend balance sheet total asset growth of billion in the quarter was driven by disciplined loan growth and higher cash balances funded through stable deposits and higher borrowings moving to slide total deposits were stable quarteroverquarter despite public fund outflows q1 is typically our seasonal low point for public funds and we anticipate net inflows in q2 our trend in average deposits reflect mix old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 shift away from noninterestbearing accounts into money market and cds which is typical for this point in the rate cycle market conditions continue to put upward pressure on deposit rates with total deposit costs up basis points quarteroverquarter to a still very low basis points which equates to a total deposit cost beta of interest bearing deposit costs increased basis points to resulting in an interestbearing deposit beta of although the terminal beta is difficult to estimate we have a strong track record of managing deposit costs and are confident we can maintain our funding advantage throughout the remainder of the rate cycle we are actively defending deposit balances through competitive rack rates and limited pricing exceptions in addition to playing offense through various deposit specials we are pleased with the execution of this strategy to date as we have been able to generate new deposits sufficient to maintain stable overall balances slide provides additional details and granularity of our deposit base our average core deposit account balances are meaningfully lower than peers we have deep and longstanding relationships with our deposit customers of which have been with the bank for more than five years and nearly a third have been with us for more than years the concentration of our largest customers is also exceptionally low our top deposit clients represent less than of our total deposits if you exclude collateralized deposits our top represents only of our total deposits slide provides details of our funding and liquidity we have ample liquidity with approximately coverage of our uninsured deposits including billion in immediately available funds from cash equivalents federal home loan bank fed discount window and the btfp we also have billion in capacity from highquality unencumbered collateral available for pledging beyond the coverage we have significant other sources of liquidity through broker deposits and unsecured credit lines as well as insured cash sweep product capacity slide shows trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields total loans grew consistent with our expectations and q4 pipeline consumer loans were stable quarteroverquarter and loan portfolio yields increased basis points to the investment portfolio was stable quarteroverquarter as portfolio cash flows were offset by an improvement in fair values duration improved to and we expect approximately billion in total investment cash flows over the next months nearly of our portfolio consists of highquality treasury and agency investments with an additional held in highly rated municipals the remaining portfolio consists of highly rated corporate securities and other investments slide details our q1 commercial production the billion of production was wellbalanced across all product lines and major markets we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to underwriting while taking advantage of market dislocation to grow attractive new relationships that said we have tightened our pricing standards enhanced credit structure and have reinforced with our relationship managers the importance of acquiring a full banking relationship for new loan requests turning briefly to pricing new money yields on commercial loans increased basis points to for the quarter with march production yields of moving to slide you will see further details of our loan portfolio we have a welldiversified commercial loan portfolio that represents approximately of total loans and carries an average loan balance of approximately million our nonowneroccupied cre is welldiversified by asset class and geography as it relates specifically old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 to nonowneroccupied office the bulk of the portfolio is made up of suburban or medical office with a meaningful amount of credit tenant leases less than of total loans are located within central business districts which are geographically diverse in midwestern cities with only five deals totaling less than million in chicago and minneapolissaint paul slide shows our credit trends credit conditions are stable and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well delinquencies and npls are showing positive trends and net chargeoffs were stable at a modest basis points excluding the 16basis point impact from pcd loans our special asset team is continuing to work through the fnbacquired pcd loan book and expect chargeoffs from this portfolio to be elevated in the nearterm the provision expense impact on the workout effort should be minimal as we carry million or approximately reserve against this book on slide you will see details of our first quarter allowance including reserve for unfunded commitments which stands at million consistent with q4 reserves reflect loan growth with relatively small increases due to portfolio mix more than offset by improvement in economic forecast and chargeoffs of pcd loans that dont require reserve replenishment the financial health of our clients remains strong and while credit metrics are stable we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated reserves given the uncertainty in our economic outlook our current reserves reflect a weighted moodys s3 scenario with negative gdp of and unemployment of unless the economic outlook deteriorates materially provision expense should continue to be limited to portfolio performance and loan growth in addition to the million in reserves we also carry million in acquired loan discount marks next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin both metrics were generally in line with our expectations net interest margin contracted basis points quarteroverquarter to while core margin excluding accretion decreased basis points to core margin was just shy of the low end of our margin guidance due to holding more cash on hand following market disruption in march we continue to proactively manage the balance sheet towards a neutral rate risk position while layering in protection for a sudden reversal in fed rate policy slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter again this was generally in line with our expectations with improvement in capital markets and wealth revenues offsetting macrodriven weakness in mortgage and a full quarter impact of our service charge enhancement put in place in december the linked quarter increase in our other category was driven by fair market value adjustments on equity securities and higher boli income next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusted noninterest expense was million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low expenses were wellcontrolled and consistent with the prior quarter the increase in the other expense category was largely due to higher fdic assessment and marketing expenses slide provides details on our capital position at quarterend capital ratios were stable and reflect strong earnings offset by loan growth and share repurchases in the quarter our tce ratio increased basis points to largely due to a reduction in unrealized losses in other comprehensive income total availableforsale unrealized losses is impacting our tce ratio by basis points our aftertax htm unrealized losses stood at approximately million at quarterend old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 we continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels while we did repurchase million shares of common stock earlier in the quarter we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares in the near term as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we had a strong start to with results in line with our expectations we posted strong return metrics with adjusted return on average assets of and adjusted return on tangible common equity of our deposit franchise continues to perform exceptionally well in this environment as we have maintained stability in our deposit balances while delivering a topquartile total deposit beta of we have ample liquidity with uninsured deposit coverage ratio of approximately including unencumbered eligible collateral credit remains strong and we continue to manage expenses in a disciplined manner as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of for the quarter slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we believe our current pipeline should continue to support nearterm loan growth in the midsingledigit range while we expect to have meaningful year overyear nii growth in in the range of to margin will continue to be under pressure from higher deposit costs more detailed nii and margin guidance is difficult to provide given the uncertainty of future fed rate actions and the uncertainty of market dynamics that will ultimately determine terminal deposit betas that said we remain confident in our ability to manage deposit costs better than most contractual accretion is expected be approximately million for the remainder of full year we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds with mortgage following industry patterns we should continue to see revenue momentum in wealth from the strategic hires weve made over the last two years capital markets revenues will largely follow loan demand and should perform consistent with q1 levels this quarters bank fees fully reflect the hsa sale and service charge enhancements implemented in december and should represent a good baseline our expense outlook is consistent with our prior guidance with full year total expense of approximately million excluding mergerrelated charges and property optimizationrelated expenses provision expense should continue to be limited to loan growth portfolio changes and nonpcd chargeoffs as we believe we have adequate reserve against the pcd book and we are already weighted towards the moodys s3 scenario turning to taxes we expect approximately million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis with those comments id like to open the call for your questions and we do have the full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions the first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler you may now proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everyone thank you for taking the questions and my condolences regarding the events of the last couple of weeks james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i was hoping we could start maybe on the sort of thoughts on deposit mix what would be your best guess as to where noninterest bearing levels go as a percent of total deposits maybe a little historical perspective and why whatever numbers you think might be the best one where you sort of think things will settle brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah scott this is brendon yeah we look back i think the kind of precovid level is probably a decent indiscernible in terms of where indiscernible how long it takes to get there at this pace im not sure but thats probably a good place to think about where it might settle r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then when you made some comments about having worked aggressively on some pcd stuff from the merger and it sounds like well continue to see some chargeoffs there albeit not ones that will require provisioning since you already have that pcd reserve but maybe just some thoughts on what kind of stuff you are working through how long it might take to work through the remainder of whered you see issues et cetera mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah so we still have hey scott its mark r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey mark mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 we still have million of pcd reserves on our books and so i think thatll work through over the next to months we would say and i dont think itll be a linear type of thing so therell be some lumpiness in there but as you indicated and as brendon said we think were fully reserved on all those loans r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right wonderful thank you very much i appreciate it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you mr siefers the next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group you may now proceed benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc i just want to take a moment you guys did a fantastic job as both management team and as a franchise to support the community the last thing i know is the last thing you guys want to do is make it about yourself but i think its ph a plotted tragedy so you guys did a great job stepping up being a community bank and supporting community far beyond loans and deposits james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thank you we appreciate your support benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc so in terms of kind of just yeah absolutely in terms of just kind of growth going forward i think it makes sense that its a little bit softer i mean obviously the economic outlook isnt great but when you guys think of kind of new loans any sort of subcategories within lending or within the loan portfolio that you guys are kind of targeting as like this an area that we could still see some growth or positive riskadjusted returns in any sort of geographies that might entail mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 i wouldnt specify any geographies ben but ci remains relatively strong i would say weve seen a lot of ci clients over the last quarter and they remain positive slightly more muted than a few quarters ago given rates and noise relative to recession but still positive outlook overall in ci generally speaking strong operating performance and theyre still looking to invest so i think the ci space still looks solid albeit at a lower level than we saw in in cre certainly volumes are down but you still have a couple of sectors multifamily and industrial which is where we do the vast majority of our new business these days which are holding up well were not seeing major rent increases but theyre still seeing modest rent increases off of really strong bases so you still have pockets of strength out there benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc thats great to hear and then i know you guys have done a pretty sizable rebranding and adjustment and frankly highlighting wealth management do you still think that theres a lot of additional hires is that kind of embedded or are we still kind of refining somewhat of a run rate i mean obviously market dependent helps assets under management im just trying to think from a fee income perspective it seems like you guys are growing faster than peers but youre clearly investing there too so just trying to see the dynamics within that subcategory brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp maybe i can start ben and mark can chime in but first the new hires are embedded in our outlook on the expense guide so a lot of that would include additional wealth hires and i know were still seeing a lot of talent and having a lot of indiscernible continue to invest indiscernible and i do think the momentum youve seen over the last couple of quarters in this space were hopeful that can continue absent market dynamics that may be a bit of a headwind there mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp i think the story here is similar to what we said relative to the total growth right i think we still see opportunities at a lower level of new hires in than we saw in but well still hire we hired eight revenue producers across wealth and commercial in q1 again i think youll continue theres still markets wed like to build out further and we still we invest for the long haul and so were a franchise that people want to join and we still are think they are a nice we think people who are high performers pay for themselves quickly we never tire of saying that to people and i think were going to youll continue to see a steady stream albeit at a lower level of new hires in benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you appreciate the color great quarter guys james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks ben old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 operator thank you mr gerlinger the next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens you may now proceed terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning and first off jim i also want to share my ongoing support for you and the old national team james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry it means an awful lot terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just a couple of questions here brendon i recognize and appreciate the predicting and forecasting deposit betas tough to really estimate but when you look at your nii guide of to is there a deposit beta range or some underlying assumptions that youre willing to share within the outlook for full year nii brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp sure as you said this is a tough environment but we did want to at least put some guardrails out there so what we did is we modeled both the forward curve which implies kind of cuts in the back half of the year and then something more consistent with the fed dot plot which is more and flat and then we looked at a range of betas from to cumulative by the end of the year and thats kind of where the range of possibilities came out as we looked at that and tried to probability weight it we have a bias towards the higher end of that range but its just difficult to pinpoint with any more precision than that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then maybe as a followup any comments with regards to deposit trends in metro versus community markets and how theyve differed over the last several quarters at all brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp there really hasnt been a big difference we have one market in particular one state that has typically had a higher beta than others but generally fairly fairly consistent across the footprint mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp and we have slightly different pricing parameters across markets and so to reflect some of those regional differences but yeah the performance has been stable across the entire footprint terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then one last quick one the debt security loss was that an investment in one of the banks that failed last quarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp it was terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for taking my questions james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry operator thank you mr mcevoy the next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw you may now proceed christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning like everyone else i extend our condolences to the onb family jim the or maybe a question for brendon the billion thats going to come off the bond book over the next year would effectively map to one for one on your loan growth so i guess is that the way youre thinking kind of flat at earning assets from here brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then the second part would be great and the second part would be given the steps youve been doing to protect downside risk and margin how do we think just bigger picture the trajectory of the nim the core margin if the futures curve does give us some cuts maybe into next year brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah id point you back to the kind of yearoveryear guide that we just we talked about clearly therell be pressure on the margin embedded in the yearoveryear increase and just its really difficult to again say where that thing is going to land but in terms of the down rate protection we continue to be really active on that spot and continue to put pressure i mean put additional protection there and obviously as deposit costs continue to increase we get closer and closer to a neutral risk rate position which is what were trying to move towards over the next couple of quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 and in terms of just broader balance sheet management is there anything that might be on the table given the environments gotten a little bit more challenging and also can you remind us where youd be comfortable letting the loan to deposit adrift brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so obviously were this is a its a dynamic environment all tools are on the table both offbalance sheet and onbalance sheet opportunities to preserve margin and protect capital so well continue to look at all opportunities but we dont see anything big or major restructurings in the future and we think we have room to grow on the loan deposit ratio we have ample liquidity and we still have we have levers to continue to let some of the noncore consumer books shrink to support higher and better quality commercial growth christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then jim maybe one for you you noted the buyback i assume that happened before march 9th james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i guess what would it take to either turn it back on or perhaps consider something external with your capital typically you guys have been pretty disciplined and when you see things but theres a lot of volatility and there likely could be some opportunities james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah obviously more stability for a longer period of time i think is whats going to require for us to get more comfortable in looking at capital differently getting more clarity as the year plays out with respect to the economy i think is also going to be critical were in no hurry to do much different with our capital were just going to continue to watch how the year plays out and if it plays out where its a little bit better than everybody anticipates i think we could be thinking about capital in the future but until then we just got to sit on the sidelines and watch things play christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thank you chris for your support really appreciate it operator thank you mr mcgratty the next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs you may now proceed old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone again like everybody else just want to say im terribly sorry about what happened thats very tragic james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thank you brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah as to some of the noninterestbearing deposits just wanted to ask if theres any geographic concentration as to where that runoff occurred within your footprint and any thoughts you can offer on expectations from here i think scott asked something about it earlier but i might have missed it brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yes sure i can tell no geographic concentration clearly it was its mostly on the commercial side indiscernible higher percentages of noninterestbearing deposits in total and we had talked about precovid we were at a low point about on interestbearing deposits and that might be a good way to think about a potential floor brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay understood and then i did want to just circle back on the assumptions in the allowance that the unemployment is that like a number like just give me a timeframe on that brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i cant remember specifically the quarter that that peaks but that is the peak unemployment in the moodys s3 scenario brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp we can get we follow back up with you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thatd be great could you just i want to circle back on the data commentary i think you responded to terrys question maybe on nii you said a to beta is what you ran through when you did the different scenarios im assuming the is maybe in the flat scenario using the dot plots and the is maybe closer if old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 we get fed cuts is that a good way to think about it and could you help us understand what the interestbearing beta is or if that was the interestbearing beta that you were talking about brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp that is the interestbearing beta we ran all of those beta assumptions through both curves but to your point obviously wed expect probably a lower beta in the forward curve where theres cuts higher beta if its higher for longer which is where were indiscernible leaning towards probably the higher end or are biased towards the higher end of that range as we look through it its probably unlikely we have the highest beta in a down or a ratecutting environment brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it could you remind me could you remind us what percentage of the loan portfolio is floating rate and then give us a sense for what the fixed rate loans that you need to reprice over the rest of the year look like brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yes we are sitting at floating today and the duration of our loan book is roughly five years so youll see about of our fixed rate loans reprice meaningfully higher brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and we are we done with the hedging or is there additional hedging that is going to take place on the loan side brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no well continue to look for opportunities like i said both onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet to continue layer in downward protection and protect margin and were not taking our eye off the ball of oci and capital so well there are some opportunities to do there to protect that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then last one for me was just if you happen to have the assets under management at quarterend brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah it was billion brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay so relatively flattish quarteroverquarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yes brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks brody operator thank you mr preston we have a followup question from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler you may now proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey everyone thank you for taking the question just sort of a ph tickytacky one within the to nii guidance growth nii guidance does that assume the contractual accretion or is there a different number baked into there brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp its slightly higher than the contractual accretion number its kind of in that typical range r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect that was actually it so thank you very much james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you mr siefers the next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets you may now proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc like the others just deepest condolences to everyone impacted i wanted to get to a couple of followups here but you used the term limited pricing exceptions in terms of your deposit management how much more frequent is that today than say it was prior to midmarch brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp i dont know that its picked up materially its been pretty steady since december and i think if you look at the average interestbearing cost and sort of the spot rate differences to that pace hasnt really increased so i think its indicative its pretty steady state mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp and we have competitive rack rates as brendon alluded to earlier and some of the larger deposit balances weve got to them early and so but most of that has played its way out i wouldnt say its done but i would say the vast majority of the pricing exceptions is largely behind us because again the large balances were on it quickly were also getting aggressive and on the offense where we judiciously in our markets right where were opening more accounts than were closing and raising balances across our footprint jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay do you guys this seems like a crazy question but have things really changed that much in terms of deposit pricing since midmarch mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp interesting question not really yeah its a great question theres been a lot more conversations but the actual pricing hasnt changed dramatically since midmarch jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay that was my sense but i thought i should ask a couple more things here youre talking about your relationship managers and the focus on the full banking relationship is that something thats different thats now expected from your borrowers and your relationship managers or does that change or restrict any opportunities for you just youre talking about the tightened pricing structure enhanced credit structure and kind of chasing deposits as well mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp i really appreciate that question because the answer is no i mean thats our model right its a relationship based model and we lend to people that bank with us in times like this you can be more adamant and forceful and disciplined and but id like to think candidly that we always are and i think in general we are but this is a place where you draw a line in the sand a little bit more and make sure that thats the case old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just last one this is a followup on brodys question the s3 moodys weighting is its obviously pretty severe are you guys more concerned today about credit than you were a quarter ago and if theres a degree of whether youre more concerned or not you havent changed your views at all and then what happens if that s3 is just way off and it doesnt come true and we end up in a much better spot than that james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp jon let me take the top of that i dont think were meaningfully more concerned about credit today than we were heading into really all of last year and into this year obviously were not immune from hearing about whats going on in the economy and but as mark said we spent an awful lot of time with clients and when were out with clients were just not hearing that same kind of feedback that seems to be discussed in todays news cycle having said that we think its prudent and have had that opinion for quite some time i guess the question gets back to maybe more of an accounting question about when do we think about a different forecast to run through there or not brendon i dont know what else youd add to that brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no obviously i think therell be a time where whatever recession may or may not be coming hits were going to well have to think about a different weighting for the moodys s3 and that would imply some opportunity for potential reserve release depending on what the environment looks like james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp mark continues to lead us through portfolio reviews and making sure that were going through and doing deep dives on the entire book and particularly those areas that are generally more vulnerable were going to continue to do that look for we have an activeproactive management that weve always been known for and if we identify weaknesses were going to put them in the hospital quickly with the hope that they come out healthy again and were just going to continue to do that and thats were probably a little bit more sensitive to that today than we were maybe six months ago but thats absolutely the approach that weve always taken in these kinds of times jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right well nice job nice quarter james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon operator thank you mr arfstrom operator instructions there are no further questions registered at this time id like to turn
