strength of our franchise remains evident in the results outlined on slide this quarter was like our last business as usual for old national with growth in deposits wellcontrolled funding cost ample liquidity and stable credit quality we also saw slightly positive loan growth despite loan sales we reported an eps of for the old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 quarter adjusted eps was per common share with adjusted roa and roatce of and respectively importantly we achieved significant yearoveryear tangible book value growth our adjusted efficiency ratio remained under total and core deposit balances were up during the quarter as we compete effectively for new deposits our total cost of deposits was basis points and we maintained our deposit pricing discipline with a low total deposit beta cycle todate as a result we beat our own margin expectations our credit quality remained stable net chargeoffs were basis points basis points of which related to a single chargeoff that we dont believe indicates a broader weakness in the portfolio we remain diligent in managing the portfolio consistent with our past strong credit management practices on the new business side while our loan pipeline has declined we continue to actively seek and win new loan business where we can develop core relationships meet hurdle rate returns and have a strong credit profile broadly some competitors have seen significant appetite change creating new opportunities for us as a result we expect the loan portfolio to grow modestly for the remainder of the year we also continue to hire top revenue generating talent selectively albeit slower than previous quarters with that i will now turn the call over to brendon to cover the quarter results in more detail brendon b falconer chief financial officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to our quarter end balance sheet on slide we continue to effectively navigate this challenging operating environment our focus on deposit acquisitions resulted in growth this quarter and has led to a better funding mix stronger than expected net interest income and will allow us to take advantage of new lending opportunities while many of our peers are pulling back our strong earnings improved all regulatory capital ratios and our tangible book value per share increased excluding the aoci impact on slide we present the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields total loans grew in line with our expectations we sold million of nonrelationship ci loans at par during the quarter as we look to manage liquidity while prioritizing lending to our clients with full banking relationships excluding these loan sales total loans increased the invest portfolio declined in line with our expectations and the duration remained steady at cash flows from the portfolio are expected to be billion over the next months moving to slide we show our trend in total deposits which increased billion including approximately million of normal seasonal public fund inflows all three of our lines of business posted solid growth and client acquisition growth came mostly from the money market and time deposit categories offset by declines in noninterestbearing deposits which continue to experience migration to higher yielding products noninterest bearing deposits as a percent of total deposits was at quarter end and we anticipate this downward trend to continue in the near term albeit at a slower pace market conditions continue to put upward pressure on deposit rates with interestbearing deposit costs up basis points to total deposit costs were for the quarter which equates to a cycletodate total deposit beta of a very low while its challenging to estimate the terminal beta we have a strong history of managing deposit rates and are confident we can maintain our cost advantage through the remainder of the rate cycle our deposit promotions have been highly successful at bringing in new clients and we are actively working to deepen and expand those relationships old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 slide provides our quarter end income statement we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings include million in pretax mergerrelated charges excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was our profitability continues to be strong with an adjusted return on average tangible common equity of and adjusted return on average assets of moving on to slide we present details of our net interest income and margin as expected deposit pricing led to modest declines in both nii and nim we anticipate approximately billion in fixed rate loans to be repriced over the next months and reinvestment rate approximately basis points better than runoff yields this should provide a considerable offset to late cycle deposit repricing slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter all of our primary fee businesses performed as expected with a slight seasonal uptick in mortgage revenue continuing to slide we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusted expenses were million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low of these results were generally in line with our q2 guidance on slide we present our credit trends which remained stable reflecting the quality of both our commercial and consumer portfolios delinquencies and nonperforming loan trends were both within our normalized range net chargeoffs were basis points with basis points related to a single longterm ci client that suffered operational challenges following a generational management succession our third quarter allowance including reserve for unfunded commitments stands at million or basis points of total loans and was largely unchanged from the prior quarter our reserve model assumptions already reflect a material slowdown in the economy consistent with the moodys s3 scenario which should limit reserve build to portfolio performance and loan growth shifting to key areas of focus on slide you will see further details of our loan portfolio we have no material change in our office portfolio with less than of total outstanding located in the central business districts our shared national credit portfolio is of our total portfolio has aboveaverage credit quality and continues to perform well we did have some limited exposure to mandated regulatory downgrades this quarter which accounted for half of our credit migration that said as part of our ongoing portfolio management we were able to exit one of these credits at par shortly following the forced downgrade announcement on slide we provide highlights from a recent examination of fixed rate cre maturities over the next months we continue to believe given the small exposure and current performance that the refinance risk in this portfolio will be minimal slide details our q3 commercial production our slightly lower production and pipeline this quarter reflect moderating client demand and our focus on obtaining full banking relationships with new loan requests on slide we present further insights into our franchise leading deposit base which is exceptionally granular and longtenured please note we reduced our broker deposit exposure this quarter which stands at only of total deposits compared to the industry average of last quarter on slide we provide a comprehensive overview of our capital position at the end of the quarter we observed improvements in all regulatory capital ratios and a modest decline in our tce ratio which was driven by rate related increases in aoci our above peer return on tangible common equity coupled with our peer average old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 dividend payout ratio should result in onb accreting capital at a faster rate than most additionally we anticipate of our outstanding aoci to accrete to capital by the end of in summary our strong third quarter performance exceeded our expectations we have improved the efficiency of our balance sheet with strong core deposit growth which has led to a better funding mix and betterthanexpected net interest income we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand our customer base while maintaining peer leading deposit costs our strong liquidity also positions us well to take advantage of new lending opportunities our credit portfolio remains stable and our disciplined approach to managing expenses is evident in our quarterly adjusted efficiency ratio of slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we believe our current pipeline should support fourth quarter growth in the low singledigit range we anticipate continued success in our execution of our deposit strategy and expect to meet or exceed the industry growth in the fourth quarter were expecting a to decline in nii in q4 which equates to a yearoveryear increase a slight upward revision from our q2 guide than anticipated yearoveryear growth this updated guidance assumes no additional ph fed actions a throughthecycle interestbearing deposit beta of by yearend and noninterestbearing deposits falling to we expect fee businesses to be stable with typical seasonal patterns longer term we remain bullish on both tm and wealth as our investments in these areas build momentum our expense outlook for the fourth quarter should be consistent with q3 excluding mergerrelated charges with some potential variability related to incentive accruals provision expense should continue to be limited to loan growth portfolio change and nonpcd charge offs as we believe we have adequate reserves against the pcd book turning to taxes we expect approximately million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis with those comments id like to open the call for your questions we do have the full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran james c ryan iii chief executive officer director old national bancorp that prepared or concluded our prepared remarks so with any questions please go ahead and ask were not getting any feedback from the operator here so old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 question and answer section james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp please operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everybody james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking the question hey james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning scott sorry for the delay and im glad youre back on top r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co oh no problem me too thank you lets see i was hoping to start on the deposit side maybe just some expanded thoughts on the way you are sort of thinking about the balance between growth and rate or cost on the deposit side so you accelerated total deposit cost total deposit growth which was great but in some higher cost areas so just maybe kind of philosophically how were you thinking about things through the third quarter brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah we think theres opportunities to continue to lend and building some dry powder through deposit growth makes a lot of sense to us at the rates were able to do it you think about growing deposits at a low handle and be able to lend that out in mid to high i think gives you a marginal margin that is a quality riskadjusted return so thats the thought process so as long as we can continue to raise deposit at those levels and have lending opportunities in those high well continue to do that mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 and as we raise a lot of deposits scott through money markets a good chunk of that is new clients to the bank and so we think theres opportunities to expand those relationships over time so i think its a and we have room to do that to raise some market competitive deposits right now r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfectly or perfect and then i know you talked about the nearly billion in fixed rate loans that would sort of reprice over or recast over the next months do you think that will be allow or will be enough to allow the margin to trough in the next quarter or two if the fed finishes its tightening cycle brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp scott i think its still too early to tell i can tell you that it does provide a lot of offset to latecycle deposit ph repricing if its going to be enough hard to say but its a meaningful amount and then you couple that with the billion of cash flows from the invest portfolio thats a meaningful offset r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe i just had a question on capital cet1 up to tce so can you discuss any nearterm capital targets given what you call market conditions here in the presentation and essentially what would you need to see to begin repurchasing stock again brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no terry this is brendon no capital targets now not thinking about turning on our share repurchase and no dividend actions considered at this time well continue to kind of run the play and grow capital old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and a question for jim could you just expand on the growth strategy thats right in the beginning of the press release maybe best markets to build share opportunistic hiring and then how does that play into your expense management for next year james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i mean great question i think its more business as usual than not we continue to find great opportunities to hire folks selectively that pace has slowed down a little bit were not really considering any kind of new markets in terms of hiring commercial relationship talent or wealth management talent they may come along and we certainly see a fair number of those opportunities but i think its more business as usual for us and ph continue to really execute on the teams and the folks weve already hired and then i think theres still opportunities within our existing footprint to continue to add selectively in our key markets so i would say its more business as usual were sensitive to obviously the demand on the expense base and well continue to look for ways to be judicious in how we manage our expenses going forward hopefully to offset any incremental cost from those new hires terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and ill squeeze one in brendon any thoughts on expense growth for next year any targets in mind brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no specific targets like i just take care that we have a good track record of making sure our expense base does not grow much beyond sort of a typical merit increase and we have some levers there to pull but as jim said its not going to stop us from investing in ourselves but we got to find ways to pay for that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for taking my questions james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 good morning jon good to hear from you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thank you brendon just one for you back on scotts question your nii guide suggests a pretty big step down in the fourth quarter in the margin can you just help us understand a little bit more some of the puts and takes there in terms of whats going on brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah largely that kind of to decline in q4 is almost entirely deposit cost related again were not getting a lot of help on the asset beta side at this point other than the fixed rate repricing but the question on the nii side is can we continue to try and grow through that and help bolster nii and thats the game plan jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right and then i guess on slide you talk about the exception pricing on deposits how is that trending is that intensifying or easing off at all brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp not intensify were still less than of our book at the exception price or promotional related and again those are in the very low and so we feel really good about that marginal funding opportunity that we have jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good the loan sale i think i understand it but was that the snc that you talked about brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp one of them was ph sheared and scrapped and the rest out of the at the capital markets book mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp but youre talking the it was out of our capital markets book which was a transactional book that we had used to soak up excess liquidity over time and so all of the loan sales of the million came out of that book jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay more to come on that or not mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp at a lesser pace if there is additional itll be at a lesser pace than that in the next couple quarters i would say old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good and then you kind of touched on it jim with terrys question but the pipeline change it feels like maybe the market is slowing down but youre seeing better opportunities but can you just maybe touch on some of the elements of the pipeline change thank you mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp i think the pipeline change is reflective of whats going on in the economy more broadly as well as our selectivity that jim alluded to theres certainly less cre activity overall in the marketplace clearly and even ci is a little bit were projecting a little slower growth over the next couple quarters than we saw the quarters before as an industry we think were still wellpositioned to outgrow the industry we think industry growth is going to be a little more muted going forward james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i do think weve seen a significant appetite change out of some of our regional competitors and that is creating new opportunities were with a client last night it would fall into that camp and i think thats going to create nice opportunities for us both on our ability to get the right credit profile picture full relationships and full pricing so those are our expectations we are definitely open for business were still on the offense and still believe weve got room to continue to grow here jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you very much james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 jim or mark the comment about the forced downgrades of the certain relationships maybe a little bit more color there i presume thats the shared national credit book but just a little bit of color on the regulatory guidelines you talked about thanks mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp as brendon alluded to about half of our downgrades this quarter came from the snc review all credits of which we feel good about and as brendon alluded to we already sold one frankly i think well sell another one this quarter at par so i we feel good about all those credits and yet a little downgraded as a result of the exam other than that you saw a little bit of risk migration but no concentrations no nothing to point to just kind of reflective of whats going on in the broader economy christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe just brendon on the balance sheet you obviously have the ability to bring down borrowings not a lot on the books but anything youre considering in terms of retooling the balance sheet into next year with the securities portfolio or plans to kind of reduce that you talked about the billion the months cash flows brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah no major restructurings plan on the invest portfolio but well continue to manage that portfolio appropriately and take appropriate action there but no major restructuring plan christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe the last one a lot of questions this quarter for the industry about the trough in revenues net interest income how are you thinking and without providing full year how are you thinking about just the cadence of the nii for the next several quarters brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yes as we talked about so i think theres the to stepdown and then largely i think this becomes sort of the ph fight for flat that weve kind of been talking about i think thatll thats how were going to be thinking about and if we get some rate cuts in the back half indiscernible actually plays out i think thats where you start to see some upside christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks chris operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs your line is open old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey i just wanted to ask a question its a little bit in the weeds but just the billion of the fixed rate loan repricing over the next months it doesnt quite ph fit like the call report bucket i guess like as i would have expected maybe in the to 12month so i guess i wanted to ask kind of whats driving that difference and then also is there any kind of lumpiness to that billion or is it fairly evenly distributed brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp fairly evenly distributed this is coming right out of our assetliability management system which would obviously include some prepay speed assumptions in there which is probably the biggest piece of what youd see from a regulatory report versus what were sharing brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thats helpful and i appreciated the additional snc disclosure on slide i did want to ask though if you could give us any color i know its a small book for you but was there anything specific that drove the downgrades from the snc review like was it debt service coverage related like just looking for a little bit of color there mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp it was principally debt service coveragerelated it was a half dozen credits across with no concentration in industry brody so and again looked at off of numbers so i think theres a theres more to come as plays out brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it no thats extremely helpful i also wanted to ask i saw the tidbit on the maturing cre loans and the subloans underwritten at basis points over the current market rate and so i just wanted to clarify i think on your previous slides you said youre originating stuff in the to range or something like that does that mean that you underwrote those loans that are coming due at the ability to perform at a interest rate am i understanding that correctly brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so brody what that note means basis points above the rate at the time of origination so if you have indiscernible old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp at the time of origination those are underwritten at which again helps give us confidence given the current market rates most of those will have the ability to cash flow brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very helpful and then the excuse me on the deposit slide that of total deposits are exception and special pricing with a weighted average rate of how would you expect those deposits the beta on those deposits to be if rate cuts did happen in the back half of brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah we have the opportunity to reprice a lot of those in a hurry some of them are fully indexed many of them are related to indiscernible rates that will reset early back and middle of next year there will be opportunity to bring those down in a hurry if we get rate cuts brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and then just one followup on the snc review and i guess its im not as familiar with the process thats for each individual bank right so for so different banks go through that at different points in the year is that accurate mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp no no so its done brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp across universally theyre reviewed at the agent bank and then the other participants in those credit facilities have to adjust the rates at the time that its issued to the agent bank but its all done at once brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much i appreciate it old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2023 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks brody operator
