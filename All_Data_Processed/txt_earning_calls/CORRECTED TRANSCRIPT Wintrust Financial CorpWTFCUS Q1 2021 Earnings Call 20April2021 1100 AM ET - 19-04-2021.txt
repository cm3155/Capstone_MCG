wintrust financial corp thank you good morning everybody welcome to our first quarter results with me as usual are dave dykstra dave stoehr our chief financial officer kate boege our general counsel tim crane president and rich murphy who runs credit the new year means there a new and different format than we had in the past i will give some general comments regarding our results turn over to tim crane whos going to discuss the balance sheet we will then turn over to dave dykstra for more of an analysis of our income statement and rich murphy is going to give us an overview on credit then back to me for some summary comments or thoughts about the future then well have time for questions for the quarter overview assisted by strong mortgage quarter good quarter loan growth in line with previous guidance ppp loan production leading into excess liquidity utilization and sizable reserve release were able to put up a record quarter net of million or per common diluted share an roa of so an roe of indiscernible this quarter our net interest margin is constant at our net interest income was up million from q4 despite the fact that we had two fewer days in q1 from q4 right about now each day is worth approximately million of earnings indiscernible was done late in the quarter so this bodes well for q2 of this year our loan growth was excellent ppp loan fee totaled billion and helped us to pay down debt forgiveness on ppp loans one and two million we said previously that our strategy was to grow the current lowrate environment relying on margins to enhance earnings until net interest income could catch up weve been successful on both fronts of the asset growth in the quarter approximately million on q4 with billion over the first quarter of there still remains indiscernible to organic growth now im going to turn over to tim crane whos going to talk about the balance sheet timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp thanks ed with respect to the quarterend balance sheet several items worth highlighting ed mentioned the asset growth of just over million loans were up billion roughly half related to ppp loan balances more importantly the other half or just over billion represents core loan growth excluding ppp volumes this represents approximately annualized loan growth in line with the consistent loan growth target of mid to highsingle digits on a percentage basis its important to note that the loan growth was strongest at the end of the quarter and that the periodend loan balances were over million higher than the quarterly average loan balance indicating strong momentum into the second quarter some of this detail is on page of the earnings release presentation the growth was spread nicely across all loan categories and pipelines remain strong for all of our major businesses we continue to benefit from the addition of clients from the halo effect of our ppp efforts and were starting to see more client activity as the pandemic impacts begin to recede deposit growth for the quarter was million a majority of the increase in noninterest bearing deposits deposit costs continue to fall primarily as we repriced term deposits for the quarter the rate paid on interest wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 bearing deposits fell basis points to basis points this is a trend we expect will continue in the coming quarters like many institutions weve seen very significant deposit growth and are managing the flows carefully however we view stable lowcost deposits as a strength of our company and will continue to grow those deposits related to client relationships finally on deposits weve been opportunistic about securing some lowcost longerterm funding for the bank with respect to the securities portfolio we remain very liquid we did deploy some liquidity in the first quarter as investment securities increased by approximately billion as discussed on prior calls we have done this on a measured basis mindful of the possibility of rising rates and wary of locking in low longterm yields approximately half the securities were purchased toward the end of the quarter at a rate above as yields moved up in march from lower levels earlier in the quarter to get a sense of the timing and the impact of the securities additions the period end securities were million higher than the average balance for the quarter and had the security has been on the balance sheet for the entire quarter the margin would have been approximately basis points higher despite the addition of the billion dollars in securities during the quarter our duration remains approximately flat from a year ago and we remain well positioned for rising rates lastly as a result of the strong earnings both the tier capital ratios and the cet1 ratio improved from the prior quarter end and remain appropriate given the conservative risk profile of the bank overall from the standpoint of the balance sheet we are watching deposit flows carefully particularly those related to ppp loans but the main message is continued good growth which accelerated into the end of the quarter and will help future periods dave david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp all right thanks tim as ed mentioned i will cover the notable changes throughout the entire income statement and ill start with net interest income for the first quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million compared to the fourth quarter of last year and a slight increase of as compared to the first quarter of now the million increase in net interest income compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the earning asset growth and increased ppp fee accretion and as ed mentioned thats despite two less days in the first quarter which are worth about million per day so earning good nii growth as far as margin goes it was unchanged from the prior quarter as the rate on interestbearing liabilities declined basis points in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter which was effectively offsetting the 6basis point decline in the yield on total earning assets the 6basispoint decline on the yield on earning assets was primarily due to an 8basispoint decline in the loan yields which were partially offset by a 3basispoint increase on the yield on liquidity management assets the decrease in the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a 6basispoint decline in the interestbearing deposits through the lower repricing of our time deposits and as tim mentioned we expect that to continue ppp loan fee accretion increased as the company recognized million of ppp loan fee accretion in the first quarter and that compared to million in the fourth quarter of wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 additionally as tim crane mentioned the late quarter deployment of liquidity into investment securities and the backendloaded loan growth during the quarter resulted in over billion of periodend investment in loan balances exceeding the aggregate average balances of those categories which we expect again to favorably impact net interest income in the second quarter the margin is impacted still by excess liquidity in the balance sheet and well be cautious about deploying that and prudent as far as that deployment goes but there certainly is some upside there if we can deploy additional overnight liquidity into loans and longerterm investments turning to provision for credit losses similar to many other banks that have reported this quarter wintrust recorded a negative provision for credit losses of million compared to a positive provision of million and million in the prior and yearago quarters respectively the negative provision was driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic forecasts including improvements on the commercial real estate price index and the baa corporate credit spreads additionally the company saw improvement in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including decreases in covid19related loan modifications and improving loan risk grading migration slides to of the presentation deck provided on our website provides additional details about the improvement in nonperforming loans the modified loans and the macroeconomic forecasts that ive referred to and rich murphy will cover that in greater detail as far as specific credit quality metrics turning to the noninterest income noninterest expense and income tax in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue increased million to a record million compared to million in the fourth quarter of and was up from the million recorded in the yearago quarter this revenue source has been positively impacted by the higher equity valuations which impacted the portion of the managed asset accounts so another great record quarter for our wealth management team mortgage banking was seasonally strong due to the continuing low rate environment and actually increased or million to a record level of million in the first quarter from million posted in the prior quarter and was up a very strong from the first quarter of last year the company originated approximately billion of mortgage loans for sale in the first quarter down slightly from the billion in the prior quarter and up billion from the mortgages that we originated in the first quarter of last year the increase in the revenue in the mortgage revenue for the quarter was resulted from an increase in the value of the mortgage servicing rights related to fair value assumptions equal to million in the first quarter as compared to a decrease of million in the prior quarter we also had a slight increase in production revenues production margin expanded basis points and we had an increase in the value of the capitalization of retained mortgage servicing rights due primarily to higher valuations on newly originated loans the company also retained million of mortgage loan production for investment during the first quarter and earmarked approximately million of the quarterend pipeline for future investments accordingly during the first quarter the company did not record gain on sale revenue associated with slightly over million worth of loans retained or designated for future retention assuming a gain on sale margin of about plus or minus the foregone production revenue for the first quarter would exceed million but we of course will recognize the benefit of those loans by retaining them on the balance sheet through improved net interest income in future quarters wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 obviously mortgage production remained very strong during the current quarter due to the high refi activity looking forward we expect originations in the second quarter to be another very strong quarter but we do expect the refinance activity to decline a bit somewhat offsetting that anticipated slowdown in the refinance activity will be an expected pickup in the mortgage volume related to home purchasing activity net we believe origination volumes may be down somewhat from the first quarter but we really need to see how the purchase market activity materializes recently applications have increased in the purchase markets well have to see how that plays out table of our first quarter earnings press release provides a detailed compilation of the components of origination volumes by delivery channel and also the mortgage banking revenue turning to other noninterest income it totaled million in the first quarter down approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter there are two primary reasons for the decline one was we had million of lower swap fee revenue and million of lower boli income primarily related to million less of boli investment returns supporting deferred compensation benefits and an of debt benefits that we had in the prior quarter that fortunately did not recur this quarter i should note that the million decrease in the boli earnings related to deferred compensation benefits resulted in a similar offsetting decrease in salaries expense during the quarter going to noninterest expense categories noninterest expenses totaled million in the first quarter up approximately million or from the million recorded in the prior quarter there are a handful of categories that accounted for the majority of the change from the prior quarter the first being salaries and employee benefits which increased million as compared to the fourth quarter of that million increase is comprised of million in commissions and incentive compensation increases and a million in employee benefit expense increases which was partially offset by a million decline in salaries expense associated with higher deferred salary costs associated with strong loan originations including ppp and the aforementioned reduction in deferred compensation related to boli products the increase in commissions and incentive compensation was primarily due to the higher expenses associated with the companys longterm incentive program and higher commissions related to its wealth and mortgage management businesses the increase in employee benefits is primarily related to higher payroll taxes which tend to be elevated in the first quarter occupancy expenses totaled million in the fourth sic first quarter increasing only million from the million recorded in the prior quarter although this increase is nominal i wanted to note that the first quarter of included a million impairment charge associated with the planned closure of an additional branch location compared to a similar million impairment charge associated with planned closures of branch locations that we discussed last quarter advertising and marketing expenses in the fourth sic first quarter decreased by million when compared to the prior quarter the decrease related primarily to a lower level of digital advertising campaigns and printing costs in the first quarter miscellaneous expenses in the first quarter declined by million the first quarter of included a reversal of purchase price consideration related to the previous acquisition of mortgage operations that compared to million of additional expense in the fourth quarter we dont expect that to have any significant impact going forward as the time period for those earnout payments are kind of shortening up and we would expect that to have very little impact going forward but there was a big swing from last quarter to this quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 and the company also recognized million expense related to impairment of certain capitalized software costs as we evaluated the remaining useful lives of certain software systems that we have been replacing other than expense categories just discussed no other category had any noteworthy changes from the prior amounts recorded in the fourth quarter if we look at the net overhead ratio for the first quarter it was down marginally to from the recorded in the fourth quarter and from the full year net overhead ratio of the first quarters net overhead ratio benefited from a strong balance sheet growth and strong mortgage banking results moving on to income tax expense the effective tax rate for the quarter was so roughly which is in the range that we normally would expect of to so with that i will turn it over to rich murphy to give some comments on credit richard b murphy vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp thanks dave tim and dave noted earlier the first quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives first from a loan growth perspective net of ppp we saw core loan growth of million or on an annualized basis this growth was seen across the portfolio but we saw very solid performances from wintrust life finance which grew by million or annualized and commercial loans which grew by million or annualized most of which closed as tim pointed out at the very end of the quarter a couple of additional notes on loan growth pipelines continue to look very strong total core pipeline of ci and cre loans was at billion and the highest level weve seen in five months the core loan momentum that we have seen has been positively affected by our execution of our ppp program which has been very strong including this most recent round which ill address in a moment secondly the granularity of the portfolio one of our hallmarks in the credit portfolio has been the diversification across a number of products conceptually weve always focused on a composition of onethird core commercial and industrial loans onethird commercial real estate onethird from our nonbank niche products the largest niche category we have is also our oldest which is premium finance this includes first insurance funding which funds commercial insurance premiums and currently totals billion including our canadian operations wintrust life finance which funds life insurance premiums currently totals billion both of these portfolios have performed very well during the pandemic wintrust life finance has grown yearoveryear and first insurance funding is up yearoveryear we have also seen solid growth from our leasing mortgage warehouse and franchise teams finally we added a new slide page of the presentation which deals with the geographic diversification in our portfolio we will always have a chicago milwaukee nexus however as this slide illustrates our various business lines provide us with meaningful amount of credit outside of our primary markets from a credit quality perspective improvement was evidenced across the portfolio as the economy continues its postpandemic growth this can be seen in a number of ways first nonperforming loans were reduced from million at year end to million at quarter end even more striking is a reduction in npls from nearly million at june we recorded million of net wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 chargeoffs during the quarter or basis points which is up slightly from the fourth quarter but in line with the previous four quarters we also saw a reduction in covid19 modified loans from million to million during the quarter as outlined on the slide of the presentation the majority of these remaining modified loans are primarily in our select highimpact industries which is detailed on slide finally credit risk ratings continue to show a material positive migration a trend which has accelerated since the third quarter of last year finally on ppp as outlined on page we have now funded over ppp loans to over different borrowers totaling billion this includes over ppp loans totaling over billion during the first quarter our median loan size through the ppp process was around and we continue to focus our efforts on our existing customers lowtomoderate income areas nonprofits and identified prospects during this most recent round of ppp we heard from a number of customers that they could use additional help in the submission process as a result we established nine ppp resource centers in lmi areas to assist customers with the ppp process this effort has been very successful and the feedback from the community has been overwhelmingly positive regarding the ppp forgiveness process we continue to make good progress as we have now processed forgiveness applications on over of our ppp loans compared to for the rest of the industry that concludes my comments and ill turn it back to ed for a wrapup edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks murph as i mentioned at the beginning of the call our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet during this period of low rates and use our structural hedges the largest of which being our mortgage area compared to the loss in noninterest income indiscernible balance sheet growth and also the incomeloss due to the lower rates ppp loans were expected to indiscernible add to the strategy all of the above is to be accomplished while enhancing our asset sensitivity position in anticipation of eventual higher rates the excellent balance sheet growth the asset growth of billion yearoveryear and loan growth of billion two of which was organic at million at ppp yearoveryear the experience have we are experiencing as tim laid out has been done totally on an organic basis the acquisition market has been sleeping todate but it appears to be opening up a bit based on our indiscernible we have received lately as always well take what the market gives us we hate dilution rather it is stupid but it appears that other people are getting reality again on pipelines as mentioned weve been strong in all categories our asset sensitivity position is close to where wed like it to be we continue to leg in new investment our excess liquidity taking advantage of market blips where no less and we totally invested as lockins allows a longterm rates is not our plan credit is remarkably good as rich said thanks to our consistently conservative credit underwriting standards diversified loan portfolio and the work with all of their lending lines and credit folks npas and npl dollars are lower than they were at the start of the pandemic and while indiscernible is delivering strong results with assets under administration billion in the quarter billion and fees growing million in the quarter assets under administration was obviously helped by strong markets further strong new account totals in all distribution channels was related to this growth wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 our treasury area was up million of income which shows that the halo effect on the ppp has worked very well for us we probably have of the probably halos in now so weve got mostly the total deposits and the loans were coming so that aids to our pipeline and is doing extremely well with that so the data plan is working we continue to roll this plan to fulfillment organic growth remained strong im sorry organic growth should remain strong taking advantage of if the opening the acquisition market where it makes sense in short im proud of the group i like where we stand and see the cap growth what the market is giving us to maintain a laser focus on credit as always we assure our best efforts and we appreciate your support now ill answer some questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jon armstrong with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi jon how are you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good good how are you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp its snowing in minneapolis it snowed in chicago jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc it snowed here yesterday question i dont know maybe richard tim the loan growth pipelines can you talk a little bit about why you think you were so strong at period end and excluding ppp if you could touch on that core ci and core commercial real estate if youre starting to see loan demand broaden out richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah its interesting we the timing is one that i dont have a real good answer for it weve had a really strong end of quarter in the fourth quarter as well as people closed on their financing right before yearend and so i wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 think there was a little bit of a hangover from that in the first part of the year but clearly we were as we saw good pipelines building and we knew that it was coming but through january and february we just kind of for whatever reason there was a little bit of a hangover for it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp jon thats been our modus operandi for probably the last eight quarters weve always build it up at the end of the quarter and then started again to build it up i think its we think indiscernible im not sure but richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah but edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp but the last eight quarters weve had that phenomenon richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah so and then as it relates jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and im just curious if this is all pulling through i guess thats the question because you guys seem a little bit ahead of your peers in terms of the growth that you put up so i guess richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah no jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats kind of the genesis of the question here richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah and i think thats a broader answer to that i think that we have seen and youve seen this in really over the course of the last year we had always talking of this aspirational nature of being chicagos bank and i think over the last year through the ppp execution and some of the acquisitions that have gone on in the chicago market namely indiscernible and cibc have really kind of seen us become the emerging ci bank mid market bank and we have just seen a lot of new opportunities come over where customers were very frustrated by the inability of their existing bank to execute on their ppp to get answers during the pandemic maybe they were just kind of roughed up a little bit during a downturn and they were trying to find maybe a different bank that might look at their company a little bit differently theres just a host of reasons that we saw but the net effect is that we have wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 just really had a much better time being able to get a seat at the table when a company is going out to the market and that our ability to execute both on the treasury side and on the credit side we have been able to pull through quite a lot of these opportunities and finally your question is relates to do you we see the sort of an uptick in overall levels of funding i do think as the economy start to open up and expand and people start to deploy all that liquidity and we are seeing people starting to look for greater credit availability and expanding outline so i think that as we go through the balance of the year here youll start to see some greater usage so generally speaking pretty positive edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we think were going to roll out of this pandemic issue as the economy roll out were very well prepared for that and i think its somewhat of a reputational issue for us reputation is wonderful and people are looking to us to help them grow so there you hit jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then thats helpful and then kind of the margin calculus i think the message youre sending to us is that you have a little bit more room on funding costs and have a bit of a stepup because of the quarterend securities purchases youve got some loan growth and i guess the question is with the growth that youre expecting are you sending the message that the margin erosion is really over for you and we should see some margin expansion as the loan growth comes in edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well all things considered yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc indiscernible adjusted edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp all things considered yes but who knows relative to whats going to happen i mean if rates go up were ready weve got that beach ball ready to fly but if rates go down wed still have some signs of vulnerabilities there but i think i saw indiscernible national debt is going to double gdp over the next five years its just crazy with all the cash thats out there rates have got to go up probably what everybody says it just doesnt work any other way so were very wellpositioned in that regard as we continue to build and deploy i mean the plan has always been to grow through this through the mortgages and the other means so as we put out early on in the pandemic which were really well to get us through this and as i said to get the net interest income to make up the difference of margins fall off we dont know it would fall off we are wellpositioned to do that ppp loans were a godsend in terms of additional revenue but thats just more we have to make up wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 so certainly continue to grow through this jon i think the margins basically in this environment has bottomed out and has good upside through and were able to execute and closing the loans getting good pricing on the loans and continue to grow through it so it wont be perfect im sure were not going to land on mortgages and the other things fall off and rates go up theyll be they wont be perfect there wont be a perfect analysis but wont line up perfectlym i mean but i think itll be i think well get there as long as mortgages can stay high do you agree dave david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah no i think thats right i think we said last time we thought it sort of bottomed out and we thought wed put some liquidity to work and grow through it as ed says the key is to grow through it and rich and ed indicated why they think its up as far as our loan growth thats what i agree with i also think we have a very diversified loan mix so i think that that helps us in some areas work when others arent but i would think that the thoughts are that the margin is sort of stable to slightly up in the next quarter a lot of it depends on how much liquidity applies on the door but weve got that billion of periodend balances greater than average count so thats just has to help and we do have some repricing assets on the lifes premium finance side that those are tied to oneyear libors but we also have the cd book really repricing now so those kind of offset the i do think weve bottomed out and i think that all things equal that the margin should tick up just a bit jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks for the help i appreciate it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp its like a pingpong ball underwater so far we want to play with a beach ball jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc im waiting for it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp be very patient with this one operator thank you thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi terry how are you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good how are you doing maybe first question as we build out our mortgage projections and loan growth should we think about call it million million of mortgages staying on the balance sheet is that the right way to think about that will that continue and then whats the earned back on that is it roughly a year if my memory correct from the last call that you sacrificed the revenue this quarter and it takes about a year to make that up richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah i mean on the earnback terry if you look at our margins being right now to the loans are yielding sort of well so the general mortgages that weve kept so you gave up the upfront gain on sale and up you earn it back over a year basically so four five quarters for the earnback period on loans but then they keep obviously the loans out there they keep paying dividends going forward so its a little bit of a sacrifice for the current earnings for future for future earnings if we think is prudent so we started on or so our retention on the balance sheet are a little bit more but so were down a couple of hundred million in the on average in the last couple of quarters probably a little less than that if volumes were down million or so going forward edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah to number is going to be we were actually when we get up to close to million to million well probably pull it back a little bit from interest rate sensitivity standpoint i would imagine million would be a number to use going forward itd be a good one the was originally to get going and a great deal done though so it should help the margin to be up as well long term and i think weve got maybe million going forward at least next quarter and well judge it after that where the market is but and you get to plan yeah david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and there are some that million is sort of the jumbo loans that weve kept on our books i mean we do have some that we originate for the portfolio that are variable rate etcetera that are just normal course of business so it may be just slightly more than that but the extra million is sort of what ed is referring to as far as a jumbo so going forward terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then as a followup question ed last quarter at an industry event you talked about ma and interest for potentially larger deals and maybe moving out of your core market i was hoping you could just update us on your thoughts there and maybe any feedback you heard since making those comments thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible we always take what the market gives us and it appeared that the market was giving people these no premium deals out there we felt our stock price going back it was appropriate to kind of indiscernible and just basically chum the water if you will indiscernible it resulted in a wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 couple of heres and theres conversations but nothing really market has moved away from that and it really doesnt make any sense right now we will consider it given the premiums people want to pay so indiscernible we will talk to them but it appears that that opportunity may have come and gone at least for now but were so willing to do it if it makes sense but were going to continue to fill in here in chicago both organically and through acquisitions that youve seen like we just did in the past if in fact it makes sense so i would discount the my chumming exercise generally come up with any fish but were still available if anybody wants to talk with our market share in chicago indiscernible say from milwaukee were going to concentrate on that and it appears the indiscernible organic growth were concentrated on that and well do opportunistic deals as they come along makes sense terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc it does appreciate that thanks ed thanks everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp youre welcome operator our next question comes from david long with raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp hey dave edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey david timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc looking at the expense side of the equation revenue growth seems to be going pretty well and it isnt usually an issue with you guys but looking at the expense side just curious what type of growth rate we should expect on your expenses especially in a revenue environment where you still have some headwinds on the net interest wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 margin and are there any plans to try to rationalize any expenses given maybe some of the margin pressures just want to get a little bit of color on how youre thinking about operating expense growth here edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we always look at various sides of expenses david is that constant indiscernible growth company we have to spend money to grow and dave you want to david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah we had some branch closures and sales of small branches last quarter and then another branch closure this quarter so were constantly looking at that where there might be overlap or underutilization of facilities its kind of an interesting question as far as doing the expense growth because with a mortgage business as large as ours as revenues go up and down there so goes the expenses sometimes and so you almost have to look at it exmortgages but exmortgages we would expect the expense growth to stay relatively contained and we are looking at the branch network all the time in places where we can save money as we had in prior quarters we have some of these contingent purchase price payments that we had to expense as i said on the my comments those should be sliding and not material going forward so that should help were watching our head count and all sorts of things so i would think it would stay relatively contained as you know though in the second and third quarters the expenses tick up a little bit because of our sponsorships of major league baseball and somewhat as in the past been general all sort of outdoor festivals and community events that we sponsor as a community bank so i expect them to tick up a little bit in the second quarter but payroll taxes will be less in the second and the third and the fourth quarter than they were in the first quarter and there are some other offsets that go either way so i would expect that we can contain the expenses if we ever look at growth i would expect them to go up but not nearly as fast as the revenue side of the equation so maintaining the net overhead ratio at the levels that we think are appropriate that is what we focus on and so but then youve got to spend money to make money but wed expect the revenue growth to be faster than the expense growth edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp one of the things on the expense indiscernible before the pandemic is we have made a indiscernible which is our enhancement of our digital products dave mentioned this in the last call we always had the digital products but we saw going forward that the overall base that we can build off if were able to support it going forward we took it away from our core processor and now had spent a lot of money and theres still more money to be spent on that to make sure that base is correct and we can indiscernible serve better products and serve better delivery systems we always had great products as we always do have great products with delivery systems as indicated by the number of indiscernible last year seven i think a number of more national and were proud of that but were going to invest for the future and to have a platform thats going to keep up with i think were going to continue to be a indiscernible acceleration of digital availability and products out there with payment systems and things like that we have to be there at the top of our game and although its kind of the timing is up but well be there anyhow and were half pregnant were going to follow through and thats part of it wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 but i think in memory indiscernible was pretty good probably lowered that number to ph to on a regular basis and the margin hopefully will come back in the meantime the net overhead ratio has dropped about as much of the margins themselves so were always looking but its not linear thats why the issue is for you guys its indiscernible but its not linear for you in many ways i know its hard but just how you go up in that overhead ratio and compare that to where the margin is where mortgages are and i think youll come to the right number for us david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc right right no i do appreciate the color and understand as a growth company you do have to spend there as a followup just dave you mentioned that the mortgage business and needing to just kind of separate that out from your core but if youre looking at your mortgage and you say the production revenue comes down by million in a given quarter how would that immediately impact the expenses in that same quarter david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well im not going to give a number of per se because it depends on indiscernible youve got some production in the pipeline and youve got to close that so it just and it also sort of depends on the outlook if you really think rates are going up and staying there and its not just a seasonal thing then youve got to adjust but we do have contract labor we do have some overseas contracts out there that are variable we do have overtime and so all those things can go away immediately and so you will get some benefit immediately and then that may take another month or two to let that production work its way through the pipeline before you get the full benefit but we sort of look at in todays environment your efficiency ratio in that business may be in the range because your work going in all cylinders but if that volume falls those efficiency and margins come in a little bit those efficiency ratios are probably more in the to range so i think if you think about the mortgage business sort of between and depending on high volumes and low volumes thats maybe how to think of the business david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc excellent thanks dave i appreciate that color david alan dykstra q vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from nathan race with piper sandler your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co good morning wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co thinking about the overall balance sheet size going forward with the ppp forgiveness ongoing do you guys expect any downdraft with this excess liquidity thats been building over the last several quarters or are you guys kind of planning to or playing around these balances pretty much sticking for the foreseeable future edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well thats a indiscernible question its a whats going to happen to liquidity indiscernible stay in the bank tim indiscernible timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp i think what clients are telling us nathan is that those balances are going to sort of stick and so they get clarity on forgiveness which is both at wintrust and other banks has been slow in coming but were getting good core growth from the halo effect with new clients but clearly some of that ppp money may be moving out of the bank as clients get more interested in investing it but if that happens it should be followed by loan opportunities for us as well as that liquidity gets depleted so its a little bit here of bad newsgood news story if it happens edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah indiscernible we were run off already nathan but doesnt seem to be and as indicated were making it up with the halo effect and the treasury numbers tim do you have the treasury numbers here timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah i mean one of the things when weve been asked about the halo effect is how do you know its real and where does it manifest itself and just looking at gross treasury revenues over the last four months were up and we know our people are challenged to keep up with the new installations and new additions so were very encouraged that not only are we getting these deposit balances hopefully on a permanent basis but that were getting treasury business that will often ultimately credit opportunities that will last so we feel pretty good about it nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it understood and just changing gears and thinking about provisioning over next quarter or two i know its difficult under a cecl framework to predict but just given the loan growth outlook still in that mid to highsingle digit range how should we think about providing for growth if at all over the next quarter or two from a provisioning standpoint wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp for growth i think if you kind of move back to indiscernible noncecl times where chargeoffs were fairly stable our provision was probably in the million to million to million range and i would think in normal times if the macroeconomic scenarios and credit quality stayed stable youd probably be in that million million range for the normal times but i cant predict what the macroeconomic scenarios are going to be if they continue to improve then obviously the allowance was down a little bit more but right now we think its appropriate based upon what moodys has but well just have to see what those macroeconomic forecasts do but as far as growth goes i mean you can sort of look at our allowancetoloan ratio and apply it to what you think the net growth is and that should probably get you pretty close edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah the portfolio appears in and older than april todate the upgrade parade has continued where when pandemic started a lot of downgrades and that enters into the cecl calculation had a number of upgrades in the fourth and in the first quarter second quarter we expect that trend to continue so if you look at that and you look at a better macroeconomic environment you think that we may have another negative provision at the end i would always hope that we could have grown through it and not have to play the negative provision game but just for the because its like a yoyo indiscernible up down where its going but i think credit overall is pretty good it looks like its going to be the environment is getting better so when you think about provisioning going forward i would tell you you can have another release but you never know anything can happen and really indiscernible and i think as you look at our level of nonperformers and to see a lot of credit quality and understanding the portfolio is actually even getting better i think we had to take that into consideration so hard to predict with cecl where youre going to end up and in fact in the old days where i could say where weve ended up but i cant do that anymore i cant nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it it makes sense if i could just ask one more on capital i apologize if it was in the release i didnt catch it but any share repurchases in the quarter and how you guys think about buybacks over the next few quarters this year david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah no we havent been doing the buybacks with the stock price increase towards that so if the stock price stays in this range we would not anticipate probably doing the buybacks now well use that capital to support the loan growth and the like so nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate you guys taking the questions thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 yeah operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning i think i know the answer to the question but im going to ask anyway ed and dave the pace of securities buying obviously yields have popped a bit weve seen some peers be more aggressive in just deploying some of this in a positive i missed it but any sense in terms of magnitude of whether billion is the right purchase rate a quarter or you would perhaps step it up edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp it really depends on the rates i think that we like taking indiscernible i dont want to lock in the lousy rates its really indiscernible rates can i think rates are going to continue to go up and well take advantage when they do i think weve locked in probably after tax billion on the deals weve done todate indiscernible assets after tax david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean when the rates popped up at the end of the quarter the jumbo mortgage banks were yielding over and we thought that was an appropriate time to jump in we did a little bit earlier in the quarter to replace run off and add a little bit but rates have kind of fallen back off a little bit so were just more being cautious and that says at the lower rates we probably arent going to jump in but if you start to see the jumbos go north of again we may add to some of it more christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp we dont have a specific number chris that were saying were going to do x it really sort of depends on the rate environment edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp so little worried through about what we talked about indiscernible previous questions is the liquidity actually stay and kind of have to indiscernible we make has to be tempered by that we continue to grow every quarter and which gives us more ammo to deal with it well deal with indiscernible et cetera but we expect this to be opportunistic going forward and not be happy if this is problematic and put it to work at any way christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 and then longer term your cash is roughly of your earning assets i mean where do you think that needs to be kind of to months out proportionally david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well weve always kind of said to loantodeposit and liquidity sort of falls out of the equation there but i think if you go back to the first quarter of we were at then we went and loaded up on liquidity and it was like because we just didnt know what the heck was going to happen with the pandemic so id sort of say if you were in the or range thats probably more normal so to speak if we can effectively lend out of that to loan to deposit ratio christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc just tactically in terms of expenses obviously the last year didnt have the big seasonal ramp in ad spend im assuming we should expect a lot of that to return here in the middle quarters q2 q3 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i think it may not be to the full extent depending on how many people are in the ballpark et cetera and how many of the outdoor community events happen that we historically have sponsored but we would expect the second and third quarters to increase this year unlike last year brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just going back to the prior question on how youre thinking about securitys deployment it sounds like thats more cautious given where rates are you have this avenue open to you in terms of being able to just retain more on the jumbo resi side would you consider taking that up materially above the million a quarter if rates stay here just to use up some of that liquidity or youre happy where youre at edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how do we consider it were actually going to probably drop off a little now and certainly we consider rates went up a bit we would consider deploying more into that indiscernible that asset class but i think we need to kind of wean ourselves a little bit off of that and just monitor liquidity as well as we can indiscernible where we can and leave some dry powder because i dont think you guys i just think theyre going to come roaring out of this you look at where the economy is expected to go talk to your customers on all the pent up demand they have supply chains have been so disrupted and if you look with the government spending youve got to have higher rates and maybe not where they should be but i think you could pick up basis points on the tenure pretty quickly in which case youd want to do so im guessing there and your margins have fall off a little bit thatll help wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 but again were trying to land the plane here and have got our margin back off at the same time as our other income kind of falls off from mortgages and other issues so it wont be perfect indiscernible way down because of the ppp loan has been wonderful now but indiscernible because we dont have them so we have to clearly go through this and be smart about it invest when we can and not doing any stupid just to try to with a lot of terms just to make up shortterm earnings brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah and lastly just in terms of the ci growth that came in at the end of the quarter i think thats very important it was is that all organic so to speak or is some of that from just share shifts from competitors edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp rich richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp well its both i mean we continue to win business and take share from our competitors as well as seeing sort of existing customers grow so its the answer would be both edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks for the color richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from michael young with truist securities your line is open michael young q analyst truist securities inc a lot of my questions have been asked and answered but i wanted to just follow up on kind of coming out of the pandemic here and potentially reopening is there any more specific focus on hiring of lenders that we should expect the ramp of headed into kind of later this year or any new business lines that you would have a renewed focus on maybe at this point versus maybe where we were last year richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 yeah i think there are still lenders out there in the marketplace that we have been last year we brought in a couple of lenders from some of the acquired banks we are looking at a couple of new niche opportunities that are there and thats really part of our whole story is just trying to find those lenders who really bring a value add and can really try to continue our diversification of the portfolio so i think both of those are pretty important as we go into the rest of this year michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great and then maybe just bigger picture on ed you kind of as you said tried to chum the water on ma for the bank side but didnt really materialize are you seeing any good opportunities maybe on the fee income side that could be a buffer to kind of the mortgage revenue falling off maybe in trust or any new business lines edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well yeah were always looking we added a couple last year murphy wants to talk about the two new niches we added richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah well probably the one that gets to your question is the money services group which is that was a big business for mb kind of prior to the fifth third acquisition working on the treasury side with the currency exchanges in chicago also in new york and really gives us nice opportunity to generate some fee income there are not a lot of credit risk i dont know if youd add to that indiscernible timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp no i think were a couple of quarters into that now with both good success in sort of a nice line of people waiting to do business with us theres a little bit of void in the market but well come with it really nice treasuryrelated revenues that are significant really by any measure richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah and we continue to look at a couple of interesting niches in the leasing area and which we think are very opportunistic and have a really good opportunity for us to kind of expand that book as well so i think generally speaking were pretty positive right now edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp and the wealth management business is kind of tough because as you know in this market everybody thinks youre the smartest guy in the world and they want a lot of money and not only that they want to make what theyve made every year and we pay a lot of money for it it doesnt make a lot of sense to do any of that our organic growth has been great we have both institutionally and organically we picked up i think over indiscernible close to accounts new accounts in wealth management over the quarter from all streams from all aspects of our distribution channels wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 so i think our name recognition is helping in that regard too and a lot of indiscernible when people open their new wealth management account so truthfully we were getting much better too with the hiring of some very seasoned salespeople around the country so i would expect that to continue to grow organically and well go from there but if you have any indiscernible give us a call were all yours michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks thanks and congrats on the quarter edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you im showing no further questions in the queue id like to turn the call back to ed wehmer for closing remarks edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks
