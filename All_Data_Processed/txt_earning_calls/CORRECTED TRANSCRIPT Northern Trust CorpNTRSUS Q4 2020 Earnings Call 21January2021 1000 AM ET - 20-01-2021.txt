turn the call to jason to review our financial results for the quarter jason j tyler executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you mike let me join mark and mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial statements of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on average common equity was the quarters results included the following three items first a million severance charge in connection with the reduction in force this charge relates actions were taking to eliminate approximately positions globally representing about of our staff this is in line with our ongoing efforts around productivity and efficiency and expected to result in annual run rate savings of approximately million on a net basis second we recognized an million occupancyrelated expense relating to an early lease exit arising from our workplace real estate strategy and lastly we recognized million in tax expense related to the reversal of tax benefits previously recognized through earnings you can see on the bottom of page equity markets performed well during the quarter recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on a quarter lag or a month lag asset levels and both the sp and eafe local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations its worth noting that on a yearoveryear basis the eafe local index remains negative which creates an unfavorable impact to our global fees compared to the prior year as shown on this page average onemonth and threemonth libor rates stabilized during the quarter with only modest decline lets move to page and review the financial highlights for the fourth quarter yearoveryear revenue was down with noninterest income up and net interest income down expenses increased the provision for credit losses reflected a release of million in the quarter compared to a release of million in the prior year net income was down in a sequential comparison revenue grew with noninterest income and net interest income both up expenses increased and net income declined return on average common equity was for the quarter down from a year ago and in the prior quarter assets under custody and administration of trillion grew from a year ago and increased on a sequential basis assets under custody of trillion grew from the year ago and increased on a sequential basis assets under management were trillion up from a year ago and up on a sequential basis northern trust

billion down compared to last year and up sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were up from last year and sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million for the quarter up yearover year and up sequentially the increase compared to a year ago was driven by higher volumes and higher volatility while the sequential growth was primarily driven by higher volumes the remaining components of noninterest income totaled million in the quarter up compared to one year ago and up sequentially within that securities commissions and trading income increased compared to a year ago and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential growth were primarily driven by strong performance within our core brokerage business other operating income increased compared to the prior year and was down sequentially the increase compared to last year was primarily driven by a million charge in the prior year related to a decision to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio partially offset by higher expense relating to visa swap agreements the sequential decline was primarily associated with lower income in the supplemental compensation plans which also resulted in a related decrease within other operating expense net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million in the fourth quarter down from one year ago and up sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our corporate institutional services business fees totaled million in the fourth quarter and were up yearoveryear and up sequentially custody and fund administration fees were million and up yearoveryear and up on a sequential basis the yearoveryear

lower interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up average earning assets increased on a sequential basis while average

offset by lower incentives the sequential growth was driven by salaries and higher incentives employee benefits expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially the year overyear increase was primarily related to higher pension expense the sequential increase was driven primarily by higher medical costs outside services expense was million in the quarter and included million related to severance charges excluding the charge outside services expense was flat compared to the prior year and up sequentially the sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services legal and consulting services and thirdparty advisory fees equipment and software expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth reflected higher

sequentially excluding the prior quarters million charge costs were down sequentially the yearoveryear comparison was primarily driven by lower expense related to business promotional activities the

as we begin the new year our competitive position in wealth management asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace thank you again for participating in northern trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today mark mike lauren and i would be happy to answer any of your questions madison please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 question and answer section operator absolutely thank you operator instructions well go ahead and take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hello there so i appreciate you noted the trust fee growth in some of thats market some of thats new business and in the press release you referred to the growth agenda i wonder if we could just revisit what reasonable expectations and reasonable markets whatever that means could be for trust fee growth over the coming years and where your investments are made under this are being made under this growth agenda i appreciate that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure glenn so let me start on the growth side and separate the business into the two reported segments and maybe touch on asset management as well in cis the quarter and frankly the year reflected good growth and you see sequential growth from a trust fee perspective in cis point of that comes from more macro factors between currency markets but points of that come from good growth in the business and that said id provide a little caution there by splitting that in half and saying about coming from what you would think of as very traditional trust fee growth thats more ongoing in nature and then about coming from items that are more onetime in nature and so that could be trueups on pricing and transactionrelated volumes that we wouldnt necessarily consider predictive of whats going forward but certainly we view the fourth quarter for cis as onboarding significant new business there were a couple of very significant pieces of new business onboarded there and the pipeline in the short run still feels good when you shift to wealth management and think about the growth there the business did just an outstanding job i think of engaging with clients over the course of the year the growth there and this is fine this is the nature of that financial model it came more from growth in equity markets over the course of the year it was a very odd year for onboarding new clients in wealth and so well see what that looks like going forward but couldnt feel stronger about how the group did from client interaction over the course of the year and then a difficult one to predict is asset management we obviously had extraordinary growth into the money market mutual funds and its anybodys guess how long that stays on and whether or not we see a shift back to more risk on transactions or not and what the growth looks like there but i also have to say that business is working on other elements as well to try and bring organic growth into the business you asked about where were investing as well and there are several areas each of the businesses has their own view of where theyre investing and you see some of those coming to fruition in different areas but one constant northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 theme across the company is digital and youll see in every aspect of the business how were trying to ensure were connecting better with clients in our digital engagement and you see that show up in the income statement in a couple of different line items in outside services and equipment and software for example glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate all of that my one tiny followup is if you could just give a little more color on the wealth management fees only up i know we have some lag pricing coming and the fourth quarter was up huge but just curious what might be holding back on the fees even without adding new accounts markets are good just curious to have a little more color thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure well you hit on a key item which is theres a lag that takes place there and then secondly i think its a little harder for you to see but we did have positive flows in the fourth quarter in the wealth business which was good and i do think even if youd said we were going to go through this environment of not being able to be in front of clients a lot and its just its very very difficult to test the growth in the wealth business based on what we went through this year in terms of how were interacting with clients i would say that the overall trends of clients using us for deposits and also the flows we saw particularly in fourth quarter i think its everyone got more attuned with doing normal business more electronically and more virtually is a relatively positive sign glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay i appreciate all of that thanks so much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks glenn operator all right well go ahead and take our next question from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey jason good morning so maybe building on glenns question also a little bit in the past you guys have talked about fee growth kind of aligning with expense growth youve announced a couple of obviously expense cutting initiatives that should help maybe even trickle down into the market is obviously a big helper so help us understand maybe how that relationship should progress through and maybe you can talk to that both sort of including the tailwinds from markets and excluding that meaning that if fees are up including the benefit of the market how much of that will naturally trickle down into higher expenses and are you still kind of northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 targeting organic expense growth to mimic organic fee growth excluding the market so a couple of things in there but i can clarify if its not but maybe we can start there jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no im going to take the theme as operating leverage and organic growth and you tell me if i hit on too little so first of all as i think back on the year and weve been talking about it internally one of the things that jumps out is we did have a it was a positive year in terms of fee operating leverage and if you look at the last few years you go back to we it was relatively close to zero which actually isnt bad because over time well get market lift but in we had adjusted operating fee operating leverage it was positive at about was plus was negative was actually positive and then if you unwrap the quarters within third quarter plus points and fourth quarter was plus points which is one of the best quarters maybe the best quarter weve had since we started tracking this number this closely over the last five years or so but i can appreciate that from your perspective people are always trying to how do we match that to what we would expect on the income statement and so let me just flip to the supplement flip to the press release tables and go to the detail the yearoveryear detail which is just page of the supplement and lets just i think it might be helpful for people to circle a couple this is how i think about the quarter and the overall run rate in hindsight if you take trust fees of million last year take out lets exclude sec lending so take out million take out waivers of million and we had market lift zero in cis theres probably million to million in wealth and so you get to about a million number and then you compare that to and for the quarter take out sec lending again and you get something like million and so the growth was more like million to million thats basis points of growth and that gets more to how we look at it and then you compare that to the expenses do the same type of analysis and take the million take out the million in severance we talked about take out the million in real estate and you get to million and then compare that to the million its more like point and so those are the line items i think to look at and to kind of do an analysis to at least youre getting closer to how we think about it and by the way i didnt even add in how we moved from the reported to the organic numbers on the expense side theres things like thirdparty advisory fees and other stuff which we take out but thats how we track internally those are the first numbers were looking at so hopefully thats helpful in getting at the spirit of what youre asking alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah no it definitely helps i was thinking that maybe we can talk a little bit more kind of perspectively as you think about and i know you guys are not in the business of giving explicit guidance but obviously there are some cost initiatives there at play and im just kind of trying to think about like given normal market conditions given your sort of views on the pipeline and the organic growth into what is the outlook for expense growth maybe a little more explicitly michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah alex its mike why dont i jump in here as well just to build on what jason said to your point i we do look at that relationship between organic fee growth and then our expense growth and when we see that the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 environment is making it more challenging on the organic fee growth side absolutely need to focus more on the expense to make sure that we have that positive relationship and then jason went through we were able to achieve that in now again very unusual year i would say on both sides of that relationship but thats what were looking at going into the next year now if we have the opportunity to grow faster organically and profitably then well look to do that but not knowing that we dont want to go in with higher expense expectations and then have another year where its very unpredictable as to your ability to onboard that new business so that absolutely the relationship holds and its just in different environments you have to attack differently alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay great that was helpful thank you both operator all right well go ahead and take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thank you for taking my questions i just wanted to revisit the outlook on the fee waivers and the nii i know theres a great deal of uncertainty and its all really subject to whats happening to rates particularly on the short end but i believe jason you had updated the guide to the upper end of around i think the range was to and you said tacking to the upper end of that on the waivers front and so i just was curious whether or not we should assume that that holds since you didnt update it and then you also have in the past said that i think you had said that you expected nii to be generally stable from levels of course depending on what happens with loan growth so is that still true and how are you thinking about loan growth from here thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so let me take those i think three questions so on waivers the million run rate is pretty good and i think from here its less about what we can see internally from repricing and its more what you guys can see externally from whats happened in the shorter end of the yield curve so overnight repo and what does the shorter end of the curve look like and aum and so i think for the run rate on an annual basis right now is million to its million to million and that we expect to hold in the book is effectively its repriced at this point and so from here its those factors that i mentioned that and i think the key is to be careful and ensure you realize that disparity between cis and wealth and where the waivers are hitting because the wealth waivers well because the wealth fee rates are tend to be higher they got into waiver land first but the aum isnt as high and so now that rates have come all the way down and the duration isnt protective anymore the waivers are actually going to be heavier in cis and the relationships not linear its their step functions in the middle because youve got some very large funds that kick in at certain levels right around where were investing right now but those are the key things id want you to keep in mind as you try and model out waivers northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 on nii i did mention theres probably million of the million that was more onetime in nature and so from there i think actually very similar theme to what i talked about on waivers from this point forward its pretty predictable the things that we communicated things we can see which are that were running off billion to billion a quarter at about 100basispoint delta and so that gets you million million million of drag about a point maybe on a sequential basis and that has been offset over the last couple quarters by deposit levels hanging in higher than what we thought of than what we thought and also loans hanging in higher than we thought youll also notice in this quarter theres a little bit of a shift from the money from central bank deposits into the securities portfolio nothing dramatic there but that was also somewhat protective and thatll stay going forward and so from here the key things are what do you think is going to happen with loan volumes what do you think is going to happen with deposits and what do you think is going to and then also were obviously losing two days coming from fourth quarter to first which is probably million million a day and then you asked about loan growth and its been a positive surprise that loans have held in there its something weve talked about internally weve been working on and making sure that were talking to clients about our appetite and what our hold levels and interest levels are and again clients tend to come to us for liquidity and theres some correlation between the deposits and the loans for sure and so thats been a positive that its held in and its been one of the offsets to that continued drag of point or so a quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thats all helpful color i appreciate that jason so when we think about organic growth you walked through in response to an earlier question you walked through some of the rates and some of the kind of the profile has looked which is helpful is the back half of the year more like what we should expect kind of like a to organic does that seem like something that you guys can hold in this weird environment that we all stock are dealing with for a little longer i guess is that the way we should think about it from here and just kind of as a tackon for that i think you guys had said there was a nonrecurring servicing fee in wealth so if its possible to quantify that thatd be great too thanks for my multipart questions here jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so the nonrecurring servicing fee in wealth it was michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp a couple million jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp a couple million dollars and just has to do with some its typical business for us its a estate settlementtype work and other items theres a couple real estaterelated items but i think a couple million dollars on organic growth broadly i think you can go back to separating it cis pete cherecwich would say the part of what we experienced in fourth quarter part of it was a catchup of some of the new business we had that was in the onenotfunded category and so certainly shouldnt expect sequential continued increases there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 but that said the pipe and we had said earlier in the year that we felt like the pipeline had been delayed but not cut off and so this fourth quarter was not super surprising to us and that we were able to get onboarded a lot of the new business that we that had been delayed and so thats good the other piece of good news is the nearterm pipeline their view is it still seems decent and that said the longerterm pipeline theyre paranoid about and so thats just something to watch on the wealth side its more of a continued story underneath the numbers that you see there gfo continues to have to expect the business to do pretty well and the east region continues to do pretty well not necessarily quartertoquarter but over longer periods of time and then you see the other regions that are more mature not doing and not having the same migrational benefits that the east region does so that includes florida and the development of wealth on the east coast not as robust and so it will be interesting to see whether or not the experience we had in of not being able to be in front of clients as much how much impact that had in suppressing organic growth brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats helpful thanks and you found some paranoid salespeople thats remarkable usually theyre optimists jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well thats a very optimistic group but theyre always making sure that were not baking in too much on the back end operator all right we can go ahead and take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so yeah just wanted to dig in a little bit to some of the organic growth commentary particularly on the wealth outside so you cited the positive growth trends in but taking a step back the organic growth in the wealth business was much more tepid since the start of covid and then maybe its a little bit tough to reconcile given some of your wealth peers but admittedly greater focus on less affluent cohorts are seeing some acceleration northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 over the past few months across both the wire house and independent channels i know there are idiosyncratic factors that drive some divergence in organic growth trends but if you can give some insight in terms of what we should be looking for as the economic recovery continues and this vaccine deployment just to better anticipate the timing of the organic growth getting back to a more normalized run rate jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah i think its hard to predict i think itll a lot of it will depend on how things open up again and i think its also important to keep in mind and i dont know specifically the peers youre talking about at all we deal were targeting a client base thats really at the upper end and imagine unplugging the getting the comfort level the confidence level to unplug potentially generations of connectivity with a family office from a custody perspective from an investment management perspective and putting that back in place again and so again the business had is lower but positive flows for the quarter for the year and so were all looking and monitoring and seeing what it looks like but not surprising that in this environment some of the organic growth maybe not look as strong as what it has been historically mike i dont know if you want to add any perspective from your end michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah just i think its a fair and appropriate question steven and when you think about fee growth for wealth management as you know theres a number of drivers in that overall fee number and so if you break it down a little bit for us theres an advisory component to it and then there is the investment management fee component to it as well so right there you can have different dynamics within that so jason saying weve been building the business but you could have and that will drive the advisory fee but on the investment product side if you will where theyre utilizing northern trust product and others because were open architecture that will have a dynamic as to whats happening to the overall wealth management fees and again our approach with our clients as jason has pointed out is to give them a holistic approach to this in outcome so i through different environments thats going to have a different impact on what the outcomes is outcomes are for that mix and then beyond that i would say thats just the fee component again these are holistic relationships that involve banking as well and so theres always going to be a shift there between what they put into funds versus what may go on the balance sheet situations where theyre borrowing more credit is a bigger component and those are important as well we focus a lot on fees for the right reason but overall the relationships are much broader and were looking to drive those fee lines or revenue lines as well steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color and i just want to follow up i wanted to ask on capital management now you have some of your trust fund peers actually outlined some pretty exclusive capital targets either somewhere in the zone of a to to tier or to tier leverage target i know you never want to deviate from the path despite not being part of the indiscernible cohort and weve seen how strong the capital ratios are as we think about the ph xvb framework potentially this payout restriction getting lifted hopefully in the not too distant future how you guys are thinking about the pace of buybacks and capital return when some of those restrictions are ultimately lifted northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp now the from a capital perspective in aggregate youre right at cet1 and at on tier leverage we feel strong in terms of and by any measure in terms of our capital levels and we certainly if you think about our overall payout ratio for last year it was and particularly the last three quarters lower than what we would have anticipated but coming into the year and having the ability to get back to stock repurchase im a broken record on this but the framework of what are our conversations with the board secondly what do we think about on an absolute basis and how do we want to ensure were competing externally not just being at strong capital levels but how does that resonate with very large family office clients or sovereign wealth funds that look very very heavily at whether or not theyre dealing with financial institutions that are strong what do the capital levels look like on a relative basis so we can say were not just strong but were strong relative to our peers and then lastly regulators very big influence in terms of what theyre looking for and so that those all that is a mosaic that plays in along with looking at what our return alternatives are as we think about investing in the business we talked about what were doing in terms of digital weve talked about what were doing in terms of building different more technologically deep operating models for our cis business weve done things within the asset management business to ensure that we could have the product set and the technology to be a strong provider of liquidity products that took investment two three four years ago and you couple all that with looking at what how we think about the stock on a relative basis from a valuation perspective and so its not one where we say were going to go down to or were going to go down to in tier leverage it really truly is a conversation were looking at all of the factors i just mentioned and determining whats best from a capital perspective steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks for taking my questions jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you operator operator instructions well go ahead and take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi look you need to spend money to make money i get it and your core fee growth is about basis points better than trust bank peers but on the other hand expenses were up across the board and so i guess the first question is was there any extra onetime or elevated expenses in the fourth quarter as you onboarded additional northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 business and specifically the punch line do you expect to have fee growth in faster than expense growth especially with like pricing on a lot of your products jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so on the expense side there were some onetime items that the severance charge million occupancy but specifically related to the new business coming on the timing of that matters and clearly as you bring on very very large clients some of the clients if its just a custody mandate that may not require us bringing on additional people if its investment outsourcing investment operations outsourcing then thats going to take people and itll take people upfront in advance so they can get onboarded and trained in advance of us bringing the assets on and billing and so that can certainly happen thats the dynamic that thats why we tend to not think about an absolute expense growth level because we can have the foresight in looking at what the new business wins are and what the expense needs are to handle that intrayear unless its coming at the very beginning or the very end of the year and so as we look into and as mike was hinting at earlier into is what mike was hinting at earlier we our expense experience is going to be driven in very large part based on what were onboarding not just the size of it but the nature of it i think thats something that is very important for people externally to realize mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so i know you dont always answer this question but for do you expect fee growth to be faster than expense growth jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i mean thats always thats the goal thats in and thats why we spent a lot of time even this morning talking about that that if we have regardless of where fee growth is thats how were testing what the expense growth is now there are often items on the expense lines that are not related to what the to bring on new business and so last year we had to we brought on million in additional pension expense that has not that has to do with whats the expected return on assets whats the discount rate those are not related but we actually highlighted those items last year we talked about real estate commitments we talked about pension and we talked about base pay adjustment that wed committed to last year and this year as we come into this year were its probably noteworthy that were not saying any of those items and pension is a milliondollar drag yearoveryear and i think you can take the occupancy that we had in fourth quarter strip out the million and you get to a decent run rate and you should see between comp and ben you should start to see the rep charges that we talked about start to bed in to those two line items and then the other thing we should expect before we get to new business the equipment and software thats been a faster growth item and thats likely going to continue as we make sure were where we want to be from a digital perspective and outside services and so from there mike it comes down to from those items it really comes down to what new business comes onboard mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i kind of have a followup question and this is relates to the question from a couple of questions ago if you think of the food chain and you can correct this framework that im going to give you but from the low end to northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 the high end the low end would be maybe its robinhood or some of these smaller fintechs with a small amount huge retail engagement lots of revenues some reports say that new york stock exchange volumes gone from to retail trading and so thatll be the bottom there and then you get online broker you get mass affluent you get private banking and you get the family office and as you go from left to right you go from more revenues today more activity during the pandemic and more erratic more lumpy and when we get to your business its a lot more stable its annuitylike but maybe not as elevated revenues as it is today so as you think about the advice business is it moving more downmarket and do you need to move downmarket with it or you view some of the activity downmarket over the past six or nine months as kind of oneoff jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah actually its a conversation we have a lot internally and mike why dont you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so ill start mike first of all id say i would agree with your framework at a very high level as you think of that kind of low to high and the characteristics as you move up that spectrum and youre absolutely right we are focused on the upper end of that spectrum and one point that it highlights is ill say both the importance of retention but also the benefits of retention so im not going to speak to turnover or what may happen on the lower end because again thats not where our business is focused but i can tell you on the higher end you have time periods like where that model of holistic advice and high level of service results in very high levels of retention so excellent year in retention at that level but if you said was there a lot of trading activity with that the answer is no in fact as you heard in some of my opening comments there thats exactly what we i would say counseled our clients against because were goals driven and so instead of trading out and then trying to get back in it resulted in our clients actually doing well through that because they stuck to their goalsdriven framework and then to your point of well then how do we think about the growth opportunity going forward theres still a significant opportunity for us to grow at the upper end of that so you put gfo at the top as jason pointed out that part of the business has been growing at a high rate for us and again we think we are differentiated at that end and then absolutely ill call it below that with ultrahigh net worth likewise seeing very good growth continued growth there and still plenty of opportunities because as much as just kind of leave that lower and decide for the time being even in the environment that were in theres a tremendous amount of wealth thats being created that means that there are opportunities for us whether thats family businesses being sold or companies going public and the executives being in a position of having wealth that needs to be managed in a way that we do it so we still feel very good about that part and its not to say that we dont service clients that are below that ultra high net worth end of the market and frankly thats where a lot of the digitalization efforts that we have underway in wealth will allow us to serve that part of the markets but in a much more efficient way and so that will enable that growth in that part of the market to be more profitable more scalable northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right well then go ahead and take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning a bit of a followup there in the past youve mentioned that youre open to acquisitions particularly in wealth and intermediary distribution and i just wanted to understand what level of appetite at this stage given some of the organic opportunities you have and then maybe layering onto that capabilities when you talk about wealth creation and im kind of sitting here thinking about well crypto has got a lot of wealth creation and maybe theres a sleeve there that you could add so maybe just speak to that thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp ill take that betsy its mike so to your point historically our acquisitions have focused on capabilities and thats been across the businesses so asset management wealth management and asset servicing weve done a number of capability type acquisitions which then were able to leverage that capability in our business model and grow and theres a number of examples of that for that type of acquisition youre right we continue to look at areas where those types of additions will enable us to further grow with client bases and importantly in segments that are growing faster so i wont address any one of them in particular but to your point that can be a very small either acquisitions or investments for example in cis where we have a capability thats in an area that has innovative new technology and then i would say more broadly than that as far as just appetite absolutely to the extent we find something that fits strategically and is attractive financially were open and interested in doing that weve done more as you know over time in cis on the asset servicing side and i would say wed be more interested or likely to do it in asset management or wealth management betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and just on the crypto side i mean theres been some loose competitors adding crypto capabilities youre talking about potentially adding it back on your radar screen or to out there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp definitely from a capability perspective youve seen some of the things that weve announced in order to have the capability to serve our clients so to the extent that digital assets continue to grow and in the sense of used by not just call it personal or retail clients but also moves more to institutional clients those are institutions we need to have the capabilities to serve them and so yes both i would say on our own but more importantly partnering with others to be able to meet those needs betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and so does it take a regulatory requiring change at all to do that i know that oct recently approved stable clients for banks which maybe is a part of the announcement you need but im just wondering from a regulatory perspective is there anything you need from that end to execute on that michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp well i would just say without getting into the specifics around digital assets and the regulatory framework on that but it is a component and so from our perspective theres a technical or technological aspect of it theres a service aspect of it in another words how does it fit with other things were doing for those clients and then to your point theres a regulatory aspect and then i would also say theres a financial aspect to it so how can you be compensated for the ability to provide for example custody for those types of assets betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right yes okay back to real world deposits well i shouldnt say real world but the breadandbutter here of balance sheet could you talk a little bit about how youre thinking about managing deposits i mean weve always heard from some folks that bringing on whether its operating or nonoperating deposits and others have been signaling that they really only want the operating deposits and will discourage nonoperating can you tell us what your strategy is there as we think about balance sheet and deposit growth over the next year michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp well with id come back to the capital levels and at and maybe more importantly at that weve got room to bring on deposits and we want our balance sheet to be there for clients and so when we get reach out to clients saying we want to move and sometimes its very significant sometimes its not millions of dollars or hundreds sometimes its billions of dollars and for existing longterm clients we want to have capacity to help them and we have in terms of how we deal with it its oftentimes theyll let us know that its episodic its them moving money they might be liquidating position going somewhere else and so theres no formula for and so were not going to take twoyear duration on reinvesting those deposits and that said theres a component where we do know its more stable and so if you look at the balance sheet back to press release tables its actually you can look at a handful of the line items and see how of the deposits that have come in really roughly half has gone to central banks and stayed short and about half have gone and been reinvested more in the securities portfolio in one way or another not out if its an institutional deposit and it seems from the nature of your question you understand the different regulatory treatment of the deposits as they come in and so we have to hold liquidity and capital for northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 those but in many instances its enabled us to take the securities portfolio from billion to billion over the last year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right okay great thanks i appreciate the color on that michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah thanks betsy operator okay well go ahead and take our next question from mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hey mike michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning guys just a few cleanups here i think the core tax rate in the quarter is a bit elevated and you guys mentioned in the release somewhere in the mix but any change just how youre thinking about the outlook there michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp no in general weve been able to move some of the cash if i understand your question some of the cash down into the securities portfolio jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no on the tax rate to in the quarter versus michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks thank you yeah so the tax rate that was printed was higher obviously if you take that out you get back down to the difference being to more episodic its not something that we think is longer term we think is still the right number in the long run now that said ill tell you fourth quarter can be even within that fourth quarter can be a tick higher than the usually youll have first quarter thats a little bit lower and then second third fourth quarters for different reasons a tick higher but over the course of the year is still a good number in the long run michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 okay makes sense and then in the release you guys mentioned some nonrecurring fees just in wealth management during the quarter could you just explain those or maybe the magnitude since you highlighted it michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah mark why dont you mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah mike its mark a couple of million was basically the number and its for the types of services that might not be a recurring thing estate services real estate services that kind of thing and those were a little bit more elevated this quarter that helped some of the sequential growth michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it okay makes sense thanks a lot michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right well take our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning folks just maybe on the net interest revenue just if you could comment the trend into given we did see a big spike in deposits i know thats typical of calendar year end maybe just to talk about deposit balances on an average basis whether theyre trending higher into and then also on the loan strategy but first of all have the loans fully repriced now given the resets provided there are some that are lagged and then just your desire to extend more loans and that trend into for net interest revenue impacting to offset the day count and keep nii flat in versus jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp at the end as long as youre repriced at this point as i worked my way back up and let me know if i miss part of the question but locking from fourth quarter to first quarter the loan balances and deposit balances have stayed elevated relative to where they were a year ago for sure but i really want to caution people to look at fourth quarter at the fourth quarter end of period it was a particularly large spike that we had at the end of fourth quarter and we did see that spike come down very quickly and so whats a better predictor is looking at the average from fourth quarter and the average from fourth quarter to the average so far coming into first quarter it seems the deposits are staying elevated at about that level but just caution you from looking at how at that billion balance sheeted at quarter end northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and given those trends do you think you could keep nii flat in and offset the day count i know theres about million per day headwind million to million per day headwind on just the day count jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats right i feel weve probably given i think what we know at this point and the drivers from what we just went through are going to be more how do large families and how do large institutions handle liquidity and what happens with rates and i think you guys can monitor guess at that pretty close to what we can its just hard for we wanted to be as transparent as possible on this but theres just uncertainty that comes from what our clients are doing with their liquidity and it happens late in the quarter and so at this point i feel like the description of how much of the securities portfolio is rolling off and what the impact of that is probably gives you a starting point that we have from this point brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay fair enough and then just one on expenses you talked a lot about it thanks for all the detail on the plan to continue to generate positive operating leverage if i look at the expense trust fee ratio bad debt and money market fee waivers it looks like which is an improvement from to last year if you had to guess if you just took your normal your sort of expected organic growth over the long term and youd say equity market returns on an annual basis and given your expense management plans on a calendar year basis what do you think you might be able to get to parity between expenses and trust fees under those scenarios jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp couple of things one its not necessarily a specific goal to get to we want to get there we want to get going past it and theres no magic between versus secondly there are so many factors that go into what you just said and what type of business is coming in from a trust fee perspective how much it is driven by markets are we growing from investment operations outsourcing versus custody versus wealth and so thats why weve tried to give you a good launch point on expenses and then give very firm dynamics of what the key drivers are but thats probably where we should leave what our predictions are over the course of the longer periods of time brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay fair enough thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks brian operator well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global securities northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi jim james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning hey okay so maybe if you could just give us a sense of weve talked we all kind of know what the downside risks are in nii and i think if we just exclude the idea of the fed raising rates maybe we could just speak to what other drivers could be more positive i guess for nii going forward is it kind of a steepening in the middle of the curve is it mortgage rates and the impact on premium nm or is it loan growth just trying to think through how we should think about upside risks to nii over the next months jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so you hit on i think two of those three examples are the big ones and if you get right now if you look at the yield curve its interesting theres not been any movement out for kind of overnight through two years and so it hasnt really helped us but if you look out farther kind of to thats where youve seen the lift but were not buying a lot in between there in that space and so if we have some of that steepness start to come not even overnight but if it starts to hit two three four years that starts to change things and then secondly loan growth you think about the difference we have in yield in loans versus even the securities portfolio let alone central bank deposits really really large so those are really the two big items james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities no it makes sense very helpful thanks operator and well take our next question from brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks first question on expenses i guess in the quarter is there still any trailing impacts from covid that would have impacted the numbers this quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp its slowed down a lot weve had some items early and by the way it goes both ways i mean please remember travel is and i tried to highlight it in the opening comments by pausing more but the business promotion expenses being down thats covidrelated and thats material and thatll start to revert hopefully as things open back up again and then there are also other savings even cleaning millions of square feet of office space that weve been able to save and so with that said the flipside to it is that weve continued to make investments on the resiliency environment that mike hinted to in his opening comments and so that means getting fresh equipment in the hands of existing partners it means making sure that the technology package that new partners have it enables them to work on a workfromhome basis thats more consistent and so that said i dont think those investments at this point and those investments those arent tens of millions of dollars the one area that you might connect to this is that we want to make sure that our technology because of being in a resiliency mode northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 were continuing this journey of ensuring were doing a lot from a technology perspective and we do link that somewhat to being in this resiliency period of time brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then a separate question on the loan growth i mean a lot of the peers were seeing down loans in the quarter and just deleveraging in general youre seeing your loans hold in i guess whats the driver of the loan growth there and can you kind of expect loan growth to continue to improve as you look out to thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well a couple things i mentioned earlier that we have been spending more so it is deliberate in conversations were having with clients letting them know that our balance sheet is here for them and part of it is the nature likely of our clients starting to see that light at the end of the tunnel and starting to make more investments in different ways so its hard to its very difficult to predict whether or not that increase is going to continue to develop over time or accelerate i would say it hasnt declined and even at the end of the even coming after looking at where numbers were at year end to where they have been just in the first two or three weeks of the year i think the risk could decline and its hard to say this too confidently but the risk of decline is low we feel better about it stabilizing and hoping that it continues to increase somewhat but weve had very stable loans for a long period of time and its hard to see an environment where it goes up by several billions of dollars were talking about billion or billion has significant impact on our overall loan volumes operator all right well go ahead and take our next question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello can you hear me jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes we can hear you vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks okay thanks mike jason and mark first one just a little clarification on a couple of the items you mentioned for the quarter the fee waivers jason youve said million youre almost repriced at the moment but what was that in compared to the million was that fully was that million number for the fourth quarter also or is that currently and what was it for whats that change and another question that you had on the items you mentioned the trueups the growth from trueups thats about million never really seen million positive generally you all tend to have it on the negative side what kind of trueup was this that was positive was it a contract terminated early that you got paid by the client or can you give some color on that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 sure well fee waivers in fourth quarter were million but mark maybe its better for you to explain the true ups in cis mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah i think youre referring to the comment that jason made about some of the nonrecurring type of organic growth so i wouldnt not necessarily a trueup or an adjustment per se but transaction volumes were higher during the quarter and then we also have certain types of services that we might be doing for clients that are billed based on the periods that were doing them at so those are the kinds of i would say nonrecurring fees once they come online there was also some trueups that might happen from a quartertoquarter but not dont want you to think that there was a one million item like that it was more of kind of an aggregation of the types of fees that we see that might be a little more episodic than just the kind of recurring fees that we see each quarter vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and mike i have a bigger picture question for you the new business that youre seeing and mike just the trillion that you have in your cis the strong growth youve seen there what client types are you seeing that trillion how would you break that down firstly in terms of mutual funds versus pension versus insurance et cetera and hedge funds obviously and where have you seen more of that growth the strong growth youve seen recently michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so vivek its mike so id start off by just answering your question yes it is across all of those groups if you broke down the trillion as far as growth its interesting because as you look across the globe at least for us in we had stronger asset growth on the asset owner side in north america and that just relates to having a large business there in the us also in canada and having nice growth during the year but if you look at emea and the apac region the growth was more from asset managers so for example in apac specifically australia strong growth with asset managers there which for us is i would say a nice positive because that business started off years ago primarily focused on asset owners with the strategy over time similar to what weve done in other geographies to then build out the asset manager services and so thats gone well and as i mentioned in emea the growth with asset managers primarily being driven in luxembourg and ireland where again weve made investments to grow those businesses over time vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and what percentage of your assets on the trustee would you say of the trillion was north america versus emea versus apac and any sort of mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah this is mark so the geography breakdown well have in our 10k i dont have that right in front of me and its hard even looking at the assets just because of the assets arent going to be necessarily equally driving the fees so a large custody mandate might have lower fees than a smaller fund mandate so if we looked at the fees themselves youre looking at across the regions almost to emea and similar in americas and then apac growing quite a bit and then when you look at asset owners versus asset managers when you look at the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 asset servicing fee that too about or so at this point asset managers so the assets though its not always an easy comparison just looking at the assets because that doesnt necessarily translate through to the pl vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator and we will go to our next question caller you may go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey gerard michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi everyone thank you mike can you share with us or maybe jason obviously this year has been or this past year has been unprecedented we all know that with the federal reserve taking in its balance sheet to just about trillion and many of your private wealth and corporate customers building up their liquidity which led to that incredible deposit growth you and your peers have seen this in this past year can you lay out a scenario where the deposits start to come down i knew theyre not going to come down anyway but if you look out over the next two years when will you start to see that change and maybe deposits start to run off the balance sheet michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so gerard to your point difficult to predict something like that at a very high macro level and jason indicated this earlier where we do see the assets begin to move and it would be true both on the balance sheet but also within the funds within the money market funds is where our clients which i think is a good proxy for a certain part of the market want to deploy those funds in other ways and so to the extent and i think youre already seeing that in the increasing values in other markets right so equity obviously has done quite well well thats more buyers and sellers as they say and some of thats coming from liquidity where theyre earning anywhere from zero to negative depending on the jurisdiction and theyre saying well i need to move into riskier assets and so thats gradually whats happening absent what the central banks will do and so to your point at this point the central banks have kind of said theyre going to stay where they are for an extended time period so that would indicate you would expect these trends to continue and then once they begin to shift similar to the rise in liquidity you would expect to see a decrease in liquidity and that would then flow backwards ill call it through the system gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 very good and then second theres been talk on your call today as well as some of your peers about all the different types of wealth managers and asset managers in the system can you guys talk about pricing pressure do you find that theres pricing pressure in different client categories or no you really dont see it because of the product offerings that youve got as well as your reputation of being one of the high quality wealth managers in the country michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so there is pricing or fee pressure across all of our businesses and that has been consistent for some time period now does it ebb and flow at different time periods given other dynamics within one of our businesses for example or even within one of the services yes but if you just start with the concept of fee pressure is there and its our expectation that that will continue now on the other side of it to your point what is our competitive positioning and we very much are focused on providing a differentiated service across each of our businesses and in doing so our intent is to be able to offset the market fee pressure now whether you can offset all of it or not again it depends on many factors but we are looking to have a differentiated offering in the marketplace and not be commoditized as much as possible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and the fee pressure is built on the institutional business as well as the personal or is it more on the customer institution business as we go see michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah its across the board and again depending on the service or the product you can have more or less but i would say its across the board gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i really appreciate your insights thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right we can go ahead and take our next question from brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi there great thanks very much for the follow up just one last one on the balance sheet on the lending strategy jason you mentioned the balance sheet is there for the clients is there a change in thinking on the lending side are you seeing more demand from your wealth clients in particular in terms of their desire to either borrow more to fund projects or to benefit from the lower rates or other cash needs and are you more willing in the past to extend those loans and then how do you think in terms of the size of the balance sheet how youre northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 thinking about share repurchase given that you are now allowed to buy back up quarterly average net income for the first quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp on the loan question most importantly theres not been a change in our risk appetite or risk strategy id say if anything its just been a change in an intensification of our communications strategy with our clients about being here for them and then being willing to be supportive as they have liquidity needs and the credit portfolio is held in extremely well obviously and then you look at chargeoffs or de minimis over the course of and non performings crept up a tiny bit in fourth quarter but still very very low levels less than basis points i think in the portfolio and our watchlist actually declined for the period so everything there looks good its been but that said the bankers are intensifying their communication with clients about our lending capacity and willingness and so thats really the driver and then as we think about the capacity of the balance sheet the size of it certainly not something that were actively looking to change in any way we obviously take the fact that we now have the ability to go back and do share repurchase seriously its something weve already started engaging with our board on so that we can at the appropriate time be back in the market within the framework that i described earlier but its not something where wed say were trying to increase or decrease the size of the balance sheet or the capital level its not going to be monumental change from the fact that we were out of the market is not going to drive monumental change in how we think about the capital levels brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank
