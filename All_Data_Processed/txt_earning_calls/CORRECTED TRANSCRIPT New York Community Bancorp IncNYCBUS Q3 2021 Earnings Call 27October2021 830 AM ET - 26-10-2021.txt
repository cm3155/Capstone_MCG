of flagstar mortgage as you may have already seen flagstar reported third quarter results today as well which were also very strong before launching into a discussion about third quarter results i would like to provide you with a brief update on a pending merger with flagstar as you know both sets of shareholders overwhelmingly approved the planned merger in early august at this point it appears that regulatory approval will not be received in time to close the merger during the fourth quarter we now estimate an anticipated closing as soon in as we can obtain regulatory approval in the interim both banks continue to work closely together and we are making significant progress on the integration and planning front both sides are looking forward to consummating the merger and creating a top tier regional banking franchise with significant size and scale across multiple business lines as well as providing a comprehensive line of commercial and retail banking offerings to all customers across our footprint moving now to our results early this morning we announced third quarter diluted earnings per share of a share up compared to the third quarter of last year excluding mergerrelated expenses totaling million diluted eps was a share on a nongaap basis up yearoveryear for the first nine months of we reported diluted eps of a share up compared to a share for the same period last year on a nongaap basis we reported a share up compared to the first nine months of both of these metrics are the best diluted eps we have reported for the first nine months since this was another solid quarter for the company highlighted by higher yearoveryear preprovision net revenue continued margin expansion strong deposit growth stable operating expenses and solid credit quality total loan growth was modest but the multifamily segment increased on an annualized basis compared to the previous quarter turning now to the details of our performance our preprovision net revenues rose to million compared to the year ago quarter excluding mergerrelated expenses ppnr rose to million compared to the third quarter of last year the net interest margin came in at down basis points compared to the second new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 quarter of the year but up basis points on a yearoveryear basis the linked quarter decline was primarily due to a decline in prepayment income from very strong levels during the previous quarter prepayment income for the third quarter totaled million and added basis points to the margin in contrast last quarters prepayments totaled million and added basis points to the margin excluding the impact from prepayments the margin on a nongaap basis increased basis points sequentially to and basis points compared to the prior year moving on now to deposits we continue to make significant progress on the deposit front both in increase in the level of core deposits while decreasing the percentage of higher core cds total deposits grew million or annualized compared to the previous quarter this reflects growth in both our banking as a service business which was launched earlier this year and continued success in gathering deposits from our commercial borrowers banking as a service deposits totaled billion at the end of the third quarter all of which are non interestbearing accounts weve had several wins since we launched this initiative early in the year in addition to previously disclosed relationship with our technology partner the company is actively responding to requests for proposals from states for banking services andor reloadable benefit card solutions to date we have been awarded the banking service agreement for the new jersey department of labor and will be the bank supporting the reloadable benefit costs for the state of rhode island these are just the first relationship we have signed and we are encouraged by the early success of our initiative and by the number of pending relationships we have in our pipeline in addition to banking as a service deposit growth ph we also was driven by the increase in deposits from our multifamily commercial real estate borrowers these loanrelated deposits totaled billion at the end of the third quarter up million since the beginning of the year and million during the quarter on the expense front our operating expenses continue to be well contained excluding mergerrelated expenses of million operating expenses totaled million unchanged compared to both the previous quarter and the third quarter of last year our efficiency ratio of remains strong as well on the lending side while total loans held for investment increased million compared to the previous quarter total loans increased million on a yearoveryear basis despite the modest overall loan growth we had good growth in the multifamily segment the multifamily portfolio increased nearly million or annualized compared to the previous quarter partially offset by declines in the other segments on a yearover year basis multifamily loans have risen million our pipeline heading into the end of the year is robust it currently stands at billion the second highest level of the year and its a reminder we always originate much more than we traditionally have in our pipeline as for our credit quality our credit metrics remains solid and continue to rank among the best in the industry non performing assets declined compared to the second quarter levels and at million represents basis points of total assets while we had no chargeoffs in the quarter additionally principal deferrals declined to million compared to the previous quarter while full payment deferrals remained at zero compared to the third quarter of last year total deferrals are down billion or compared to billion in the third quarter of last year during the quarter loans to days past due increased to million practically all of which was related to one borrower and consist of several multifamily and mixed use properties all of the delinquencies are in the day bucket we are working with the borrower ph whos taking advantage of our cares act loan modification program the loans have an original weighted average ltv of and the bank is well secured therefore we do not expect to incur any losses on this relationship new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 before moving on id like to take a few moments to comment on the new york city economy four of the cityside boroughs have been doing very well since early this year now manhattan is coming back as the reopening gains momentum schools and businesses have reopened restaurants are open and allowed to operate at capacity broadway reopened last month and tourism has increased while not fully back to normal manhattan is definitely on the path to normalization the manhattan residential real estate market has rebounded strongly while a segment of the market the nonluxury rental regulated multifamily market has proven to be very stable lastly during the quarter we announced our investment and entered into a partnership with figure technologies one of the leading fintech companies focused on payments systems and learning via the blockchain technology we are very excited about this partnership and believe it will support our strategic initiatives as i outlined earlier this year with that we would be happy to answer any questions you may have we will do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or during the week operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question is coming from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning good morning tom i guess just first on credit so obviously you mentioned you dont expect any losses tied to the npa increase but give us some sense of when did you anticipate that this was coming down the pike over the last few months and should we expect more of these some of these deferrals roll off and customers take like actual assessment of where things stand cash flowwise thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so ebrahim so obviously we have a long stated history of very rarely having any delinquencies ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so clearly we dont anticipate something like this but obviously we feel very comfortable on the level of ltv that we have on ph originally via this particular cluster of loans were very confident that we are working closely with the borrower and we feel confident that by the end of the year he will be in a status of current so again we feel highly confident that were in a good position here we dont anticipate because historically we get new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 paid on all our loans so this is not something that we anticipated at all however we are working very closely with our customer and we feel highly confident that hell be current by the end of the year as far as overall if and i would categorize it just to be specific this is all manhattanbased property so i believe when you think about the boroughs when we talked about my comments upfront about the five boroughs manhattan is definitely coming back very very strongly in particular in the multifamily rent regulated and non luxury marketplace so clearly were seeing a supply and demand situation where theres not enough supply and theres tremendous demand for it on the housing side so we feel highly confident since these are blended buildings some of them are mixed use some of them is just pure rentals but feel highly confident as he has to reup his lease as theyre coming into the market which is significantly higher when they were during the pandemic ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood okay and i guess just moving on to the margin when we think about the core nim i think you guided for to bps adjusted for a couple of bps last quarter i think you said in the middle of that just talk to us in terms of how much more margin expansion is there to go as you think about funding cost leverage and also you made some pretty decent banker hirings on the deposit size during the quarter just give us if you can a framework around how big that loan interestbearing bucket can get over the next few quarters next year and what mix do you think just organically exflagstar that could look like as we think about the next year or so thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so ebrahim obviously exflagstar this division of deposit gathering is significantly changed ph here the company effective january it was focusing on gathering core deposits focusing on working with our customers getting our operating accounts in line when we close these loans and its working its a cultural shift thats working and were seeing good success on that in addition to that as i indicated we are very actively pushing banking as a service as a product line here and we have resources behind that and we are seeing the results of that and in my prepared remarks we won some nice unique business throughout the quarter but throughout the year its been growing very nice i think were all close to billion as of today so its growing very nicely and the pipeline is building so i think when you think about that type of money its traditionally zero cost very stable and noninterestbearing so i think thats a solid book of business what we want to do obviously on a standalone basis is build a better core funding base when we look at our company and be less dependent on wholesale funding so we think these initiatives both on the commercial side is key as well as building out a line of business such as banking as a service and utilize our balance sheet to gather more liabilities that are more stable than the nontraditional wholesale mechanism to fund the business so were pretty excited about that im not going to give deposit growth as far as for next year because obviously when you put flagstar and nycb together its significant because they have a tremendous amount of liquidity that they dont need right now given that they use the funds we will be very powerful on combination in respect to total funding based on a blended basis so were excited about that opportunity but on standalone basis that is the strategy right now and were seeing very good results throughout the year and were continuing to focus on the cultural shift on mandating the operating accounts we secure the deposits when we close our loans and thats a priority for us ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 sure and outlook for the margin tom thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc again i think were getting to a point now where our cd costs are probably indiscernible within ph to basis points ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so youre not going to see much on the cd side i would say that youre probably going to be in line with what we saw last quarter a couple of basis points per quarter of margin expansion ex the combination of flagstar but with flagstar combined and going into next year as we ph reposition ourselves for interest rate risk continued margin expansion so clearly were confident that the cost of funds will continue to go lower albeit smaller however as the yield curve starts to steepen here we have an opportunity to deploy a lot of liquidity and were sitting on a lot of cash right so were not buying assets and we believe this quarter should be the highest quarter for growth we have a very strong pipeline in addition to the close to billion of the pipeline that we have we have a significant amount of ph apps that are in the pipeline so i would envision the fourth quarter being the highest growth quarter of the year for net loan growth which should help the margin as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it ill be in queue thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is coming from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah tom just to follow up on those comments on loan growth just talk about the fourth quarter your comfort level with the midsingle digit guide i think we all were expecting fourth quarter pickup that you could just kind of frame that out a little bit more thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so the good news is the pipeline as you can see the numbers are public its one of the strongest pipelines weve had through the year we have a lot of loans that ph were apping up right now thats in process for approval so we feel pretty good about where we are in respect to the momentum were going into november here and then we see the growth which is favorable so we will have a growth net loan growth quarter i think what was somewhat of a disappointment is that when the specialty finance business and it sounds like a cliche but when you think about the supply chain that does impact our book of business right so we have probably an extra billion of commitments that are not being drawn down because the customers that are in that portfolio these are all a aatype credits are ph not drawing down on the line so clearly thats where were sitting there with great opportunity however the supply chain is having impact on the specialty finance book so typically the specialty finance book has been growing around on average i think our cagr is close to since we put it in inception so this is probably the worst year we had since we started the business and thats a net growth which is not terrible given the environment we think that could pick up assuming there is some release on the supply chain as we go into the fourth quarter thats the unknown so we add that first a very strong commercial borrowing opportunity here both on multifamily and also on the commercial side we feel pretty optimistic that we will have growth absent changes in the supply chain if the supply chain starts to ease up a little bit then the growth will be stronger brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and just a question for lee you mentioned he was on the call flagstar gain on sale looked very strong this quarter if you could just break down how much of that was ebo and any q4 guide you wish to provide that would be helpful lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc yeah sure this is lee well first of all were very pleased with our q3 mortgage results we guided to million to million and we came in at million thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yes lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc about ph million of that was ebo and i think the strong earnings was in large part due to our diversified mortgage model and we saw more retail ph locks in q3 versus q2 as a percentage of overall originations and retail is a higher margin channel and we executed on five rmbs deals in the quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 which made us the second largest rmbs issuer in the quarter behind chase we also kept costs under control mortgage costs actually declined million quarteronquarter and mortgage expense as a percentage of close loan volume declined from to so we feel good about the flexibility and optionality our model affords us together with the good cost control and discipline we execute with looking into q4 were guiding to million to million gain on sale the main reasons for the decline in q4 versus q3 are just normal seasonality and were seeing that in the agency and mba volume forecasts the fed tapering discussions have increased bond yields and mortgage rates and we have seen a slight compression in primarysecondary spreads and then the fhfa reversal of certain pspa provisions was a slight negative to us given were a bank and an aggregator we were able to step into the void that the gscs will leave in and then were planning on three rmbs deals in q4 versus the five that we executed on in q3 and were planning on executing on six in q1 as we look further forward into the agency and mba forecasts are saying its going to be a trillion market in trillion market in any time the markets over trillion thats healthy as i mentioned were planning on six rmbs deals in q1 and well continue to leverage that program utilize our diversified mortgage model and find pockets of opportunities we have the balance sheet which gives us the ph hfs hfi and msr flexibility and that rmbs program gives us execution optionality finally with the bigger balance sheet as a result of the merger it gives us growth opportunities across all of our sales channels across the hfi portfolio products holding more msrs which benefit us from a deposit point of view the rmbs program as ive mentioned and supporting the nycb branches and customers as ive said before were trying to generate more consistent and predictable mortgage earnings using all the levers that ive just discussed that we have at our disposal brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay more than a target for us thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you lee operator thank you our next question is coming from dave rochester of compass point please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys hey you already highlighted a number of positives on the flagstar quarter that was pretty impressive i noticed the warehouse was also up nicely and that bucked the trend a lot of the banks out there so just any comments on that front would be great and if you can just remind us everything thats done prior to the close of the deal here to really hit the ground running on day one post the close on the warehouse front i know youve reached out to a lot of your top accounts to let them know that larger lines could be available so if you just talk about that and then i know on the deposit side you really havent targeted that pool of deposits maybe size what that opportunity is there that would be great new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so that question is directed to lee smith or sandro david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah let me this is sandro let me take it yes so weve just been executing in the fashion that we told you that we would and that was number one to continue to expand our relationships and take more market share as the mortgage market itself shrinks and weve been successful in doing that one of the ways were doing that ex the anticipated merger is to do more syndications on the flagstar side where were leading opportunities with bigger organizations taking bigger positions and then sharing them with other banks and then as we do think about the upcoming merger while still staying within our loan concentration limits which weve always been very conservative and disciplined around as the market itself shrinks rather than just lose relationships or levels of outstanding in terms of amounts drawn on line what were doing is expanding relationships with our best customers because were more comfortable taking larger positions with them again as i said still staying within our conservative and disciplined concentration levels both in terms of the overall size of the warehouse portfolio as well as on individual credit basis so its just really what weve been doing for a long time here for the last five seven years as weve focused on growing the warehouse business taking advantage of the opportunities doing it well from a service perspective and getting paid fairly for what we do and as a result of that the business has held very strong and were very optimistic about it being able to continue with that kind of strength going forward thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc maybe lee do you want to talk about the deposit initiatives tied to the flagstar portfolio given the potential business combination lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc yeah so as it relates to the servicing or subservicing business theres a lot of custodial deposits tied to that and just given the size of our balance sheet we have excess custodial deposits that weve put with other institutions given the merger were able to bring those custodial deposits back given were going to have the bigger balance sheet and so thats going to be an advantage from a funding point of view and then just having a bigger balance sheet i think given the relationships we have with msr funds with warehouse borrowers it gives us the opportunity to go and bring in more deposits than weve been able to with the smaller balance sheet so we think that is going to be another big advantage of this combination and having a billion balance sheet alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah just to expand on the reference lee made to warehouse customers we do not seek escrow deposits from warehouse customers because we just dont need them we do have regular deposit relationships with our new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 warehouse customers and thats relatively significant but the opportunity to take in escrow deposits is its hard for me to estimate what that is but i know that its significant because its never been something that weve needed to do but we are telling our warehouse customers that we will be in a position to show some interest in that post merger but its really difficult for me to tell you how much but i do think its meaningful if thats helpful david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah i appreciate that thanks for the color there and then tom i got one for you just on the multi family side of things i know historically youve seen your borrowers coming back to the banks to refinance when the five year jumps and theres an expectation that will keep going higher weve heard that from you guys weve heard from other banks and from brokers that we talk to in the market as well are you seeing any start of that any sign of that at this point and if not what do you expect you would need to see in that fiveyear moving higher to start seeing that kind of concern amongst your borrowers thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc okay thats a great point this is clearly a change in the shape of the curve the back end has moved up considerably ph and the five years has also gravitated higher this is actually great for our business because the decision to go agency versus portfolio makes it more towards the portfolios which is favorable were seeing that so i would say with conviction that we are getting more opportunity to be more competitive there and i think on the rate side youre at higher levels so i think this is going to get people focused in respect to the next financing alternative that usually is a relatively short asset if the tapering does take place it does have an impact on the back end of the curve as well as the value of the curve it will be very favorable for our business we see some good property transactions occurring in the five boroughs which is very favorable we also see various what we call seasoned players not exiting but expanding their operations into new demographics that were following so thats also going to be part of our growth so were very bullish about this pandemic hopefully coming to a better place and seeing manhattan out and about and the foot traffic is significant we think this is going to bode into a significant opportunity as the customers that are on the spotlight will have to make decisions these are shortdated assets theyre not longdated assets and it seems that well see more and more of the traditional five sevenyear type stuff coming out when rates start to rise here so were very optimistic there david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great all right thanks guys operator thank you our next question is coming from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 hi great thanks good morning tom in terms of the deal getting pushed out just a little bit towards first quarter can you just talk about like what are the regulators looking for or asking for or just any kind of color behind why this seems to be getting pushed just a little bit thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi i would just be very clear in my opening remarks its very clear its in a position that its with our regulators were waiting for approval were very optimistic about the merger however its in regulatory hands so we clearly are working towards our common goal of getting this transaction closed as soon as possible as you know we cant specifically discuss what we do with our regulators so obviously its in the hands of regulatory process ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc understood i thought id ask nonetheless i guess my second question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc we appreciate the question but as you can imagine it is what it is ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i know i understand just come back to that that large borrower in manhattan i get that youre very well secured obviously really low ltvs but can you just provide a little more color like why is he having problems at this point because obviously the new york market is coming back indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so yeah ill give you very specific we were very generous from day one with the cares act and many customers took out of an abundance of caution that relief he was one of the few customers that did not take relief he was paying all through the depths of the pandemic which really could have bolstered his balance sheet that decision was made and obviously when you look back he probably at least thought at a lower level to realize that the pandemic was worse than he expected and the end result is that he needs relief now and ultimately as you know we dont typically have loans that go past days and these are low leverage type properties and we could sell the notes in a very short order and be out of this relationship but were very comfortable given the cares act relief that weve provided to him and the fact that we have an ongoing dialogue and we feel highly confident that he will be in a current position by the end of the year so again it is what it is its unfortunate that he did not take advantage of what the bank had offered many of our customers did by the way and literally during the phase of the first six months of no pay they came back and saw the ph paying they didnt want to put the money in the back end so i think hes one of the few customers who did not take advantage of the cares act early on and the good news is that when you look at where the market is and these leases that are coming back for renewal theyre going to be much higher than they were when we leased them out in the middle of the pandemic these are not long dated leases so were highly confident that well be in a good position here ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 all right fair thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is coming from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everyone i want to follow up on the deposit growth that youve seen particularly the non interest bearing that you cite with the banking as a service i guess maybe i missed this but expectations for non interestbearing deposits to continue to grow i think theres a view in the market that most banks will not see as much growth in noninterestbearing given the move up in rates and kind of some parked money but interested in your thoughts specific to that thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so chris this is the type of deposit we focus on this is preloaded card business its very sticky its driven off of some of the stimulus payments that are out there including the new ones that are coming who knows whats coming in the future so these are interesting programs the technology provided so the technology out there that does play in the space need to have a bank behind them on a ph win perspective when you deal with tying into your system so we are providing that we are also looking at putting our own request for proposals throughout the country for that business and its not just in the local area its throughout the country so were very active on expanding that but i also want to be very clear weve spent some real effort here and brought in some new people on banking as a service and focusing on technology initiatives which will result in us probably having some technology wins with companies that are in the space that are challenger banks us banks that have access to substantial funding but theyre not fdic insured so we will use our balance sheet to be able to enjoy the opportunity to provide insured deposits that i believe the marketplace will be requiring to have when you deal with some of these challenger bank situations and a lot of those players are smaller players that are capped out at billion for durbin reasons on the fee side and we can partner with them so we are fairly focused on that we think its going to be a significant potential for the bank im not going to give a number on it but were right where we started at zero now were billion its only been around months so thats a pretty good track record and we have so many opportunities in the pipeline that were bullish about now youre not going to win every one and youre not ph doing every request for proposal but we are reaching out to some major challenger players out there and not in any partners in the marketplace to house this liquidity event and were willing to work with them and in addition to that were also focusing on a planning perspective with flagstar to use this escrow opportunity as a tremendous way to structure term weve done this before when we had the mortgage business we had structured term where some of the large players that weve done business on a conduit basis were structuring out very cheap cost low cost deposits in a term perspective and they were comfortable going out more than just a well call it a shortterm position were taking a longer term position with us as a partnership so thats kind of how were thinking about it and we kind of classify the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 ph doing banking as a service as well as we continue to drive into the technology initiatives thats out there we think theyll pay dividends for us and by the way this is a strategy of the bank this is focusing on better funding the balance sheet as we change the dynamic of the company christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no thats great thank you for that color just i want to followup on just overall rate sensitivity given the markets the moveup in rates could you help us with kind of a longer term it seems like theres a funding advantage when flagstar comes on and i know when the deal was announced you talked about the balance sheet being better positioned but if we ph take out the market pricing in a couple of hikes by the end of next year into how should we think about margin development pro forma developing thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so let me start off and ill just say big picture and ill hand it over to mr pinto big picture is that nycb in combination with flagstar they are asset sensitive liability sensitive for the most part theyre mostly an adjustable rate type lender were mostly fixed when you blend that we are in a very good position to manage very well thats the big picture and thats part of the merits of the transaction we feel highly confident when these companies come together the balance sheet has a very different position on interest rate risk that being said ill have mr pinto just go dive into some of the details on a standalone basis where we stand john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean as you know on a standalone basis we have been and continue to be liability sensitive but on the nii side that has begun to change a little bit and moderate but as tom mentioned thats been moderating because of the potential deposits we can bring in on the noninterestbearing side and limit our reliance on wholesale funding right thats the goal to continue to take that billion of wholesale borrowings and pay it down when we can with core deposits so that will be the big generator for us to continue to limit the liability sensitive nature of our standalone balance sheet and until were close to flagstar where that nii sensitivity turns to more of a positive perspective given the amount of floating rate loans and the asset structure at flagstar thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so i would just add to johns point if you think about the fourth quarter we have about million coming due from a wholesale position thats at a cost of million thats pretty expensive in this environment i mean you go out lets say the full year is another billion thats just about its still considered very expensive in this environment and when you go out to its billion at about so on blended we have an opportunity here to take advantage of a much lower rate environment we believe there will be probably some changes in the year ahead but not enough to really take away the opportunity to restructure or revalue reposition that close to billion we know whats coming due in the quarter and that will probably get paid off with cash so we have zero cost money that will pay off the million when you think about and when you think about the business combination with flagstar the opportunity to look at the entire liability book on a holistic basis is clearly to our advantage so were excited about that opportunity we think theres going to be real value there we havent put a number on it yet nor will we until we close the transaction but clearly we think its a great opportunity new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you very much and then just to followup the one regulator approval can you just specify which regulator youre waiting on thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc the way our structure is were ph in an fdic state so we have not received our fdic and state approvals yet then after that it would then go to the fed its the process of our regulatory structure christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you thomas robert

in terms of loan concentrations to a single relationship thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so we dont disclose the ph house number but we do have we have always had sizable relationships to very wealthy property owners that have significant locations all collateralized individually steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 so we do not have a well im not going to disclose my house limit but we do have large relationships and weve been doing that as part of our business model i think the good news about that as we start building this mandate on the deposit side were seeing the growth in our deposits from these longterm large relationships but now clearly going back to that one specific customer im going to say it again we feel very confident that well be current by the end of the year and more importantly we have adequate collateral to deal with it for some reason were not in a position at the end of the year to be current so we feel pretty good about it but clearly and steven you know the business model we deal with significant families throughout the five boroughs as well as expanding outside of the five boroughs now for a number of reasons and were very comfortable with our relationship lending steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful tom on the margin so regarding the sizable decline in the prepayment penalty fees in the quarter was that attributable just to rates moving up a bit and do you expect to see refinance activity further slow thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc again steven and again rate does make a difference though if there is a real steepness in the curve i think many customers will react theyve been enjoying a relatively low coupon as they make their decisions and obviously with the pandemic that have slowed things down considerably it seems like theres a pick up here were hearing about transactions there are many many players on the sidelines with significant liquidity looking to buy assets and the math does its still compelling the math is a doubledigit return if bought right with cap rates that are holding up between to so i think at the end of the day i think youre really looking at a market thats ripe for a rebound assuming that manhattan has a stronger recovery i will be very clear the five boroughs the last frontier is manhattan were seeing significant positive movement there we are seeing our customers i will tell you with conviction there are deals in the pipeline that are purchased as well as refi but i think if rate moves here given the tapering thats potentially out there and as well as a theory that rates are going to be higher that will make customers rethink about their opportunities and probably come to the table sooner which would generate not only prepayment income but also potential loan growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes okay thats helpful and finally tom could you give color on the decline in the security yields in the quarter was off quite a bit quarteroverquarter and then just from a spot rate view where are new loans and securities going in today thanks thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so we really havent been buying any securities for a while john was that right thank you john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and youve seen the balance just continue to kind of drop quarteroverquarter and thats just some of the higheryielding securities coming off the home loan bank has lowered its rate slightly over the when you look quarteroverquarter as well and there were also in the if you remember in the second quarter we had significant prepayment fees on our securities portfolio as well so thats whats generating the actual top line miss when you look at exposed prepaid its not down anywhere near as much but we are still seeing some pressure new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 there right were trying to limit security purchase this year to avoid putting on duration in this interest rate environment and thats why well be sitting on a little extra cash for the time being until were ready to put some of that money to work hopefully in loans and of course in securities as market conditions dictate thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc we have probably an ample cash position by design we were not going to put it into duration risk right now we believe its a waiting game if there is a significant move in the back end and we can see opportunities well put some money to work right now we have a lot of zero cost money that we can easily earn and put on in the market but we dont think its the right decision right now were going to be patient and in addition to that were also looking at the opportunity to put these two business models together with flagstar and look at the holistic view of the entire portfolio which would be a reshuffling so we are not going to exhaust the liquidity today until we see truly a significant movement of interest rates and well take advantage of that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and ph the spike yield on new loans thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc its north of like now thats a good movement i will tell you fourth quarter is less of a challenge than it was in q2 and q3 so we like the fact that the yield curve has moved very nicely for us like i indicated i think the customers are contemplating what they want to do now as they come closer to their role which is good for us because its at a higher rate so it seems that and thats also going to impact the decision to go agency versus portfolio so any time this curve starts to steepen like this and flows to our advantage the customers tend to think about a shorter duration and go to the portfolio lenders steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for the color thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure steven operator thank you our next question is coming from steve moss of b riley securities please go ahead steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning maybe just following up on credit here modifications coming down kind of curious obviously you have the indiscernible you expect to cure but just how we think about the reserve and provision expense going forward here thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 ill talk indiscernible and ill turn the cecl conversation back to pinto big picture i think youre going to see in short order a lot of this stuff thats going to roll off the cares act obviously assuming congress is done with providing relief under the cares act we believe this someodd million will come down substantially in the quarters ahead probably a substantial adjustment by next time when we report to the marketplace in january you should see a noticeable reduction and i guess by the time march or april comes that that cares act will be exhausted and were probably going to be left with some bucket full of loans but very manageable and highly reserved given our cecl components when we put that together and with that ill go to john in respect to the big picture on the reserve side john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah right now as you saw with our cecl results and our small benefit this quarter we expect to be in that range of course depending upon loan growth as well so if we do have substantial loan growth of course under cecl you have to provide for that in the quarter but besides that we dont see anything in the economic environment substantially changing its been quarter over quarter getting better and improving based on the moodys forecasts that come out so were not seeing anything that would give us any pause that we see larger provisions coming down the road if anything were in that small recovery depending on loan growth we just dont see anything in the portfolio today that would drive anything else steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful and then just in terms of expenses here came in a little bit better than expected kind of thoughts on expenses for the fourth quarter for you guys going forward here john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think expenses for the fourth quarter will be flat to the third quarter we dont expect any real pickup in the fourth quarter were very comfortable in this million range right now steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc thats ex mergerrelated indiscernible john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc correct ex mergerrelated steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc great okay great thank you very much appreciate that john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc a pleasure operator thank you our next question is coming from matthew breese of stephens please go ahead new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hi good morning thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey just going back to the regulatory approval front first id assume you need new york state approval but who is flagstar regulated by at the bank level and how does that factor in here thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc ph their occ and the applications with nycb so we would need fdic and statement after that happens we get the fed and then we close matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it so it really sounds indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc correct matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then just to hone in the deal close down the timing a little bit do you anticipate this being like a first half of event i think someone said first quarter but i dont remember reading or hearing that from you or in the release thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hey matt i was very clear obviously this is in the hands of our regulators its going through the application process and were anticipating closing as soon as we can in other than that i cant get specific matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay understood thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and i apologize for not being able to expand upon that but its in the hands of our regulators new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc completely understand i was also hoping you could talk a little bit about the partnership with figure theres a couple of data points out there mr cagney has suggested that youre providing that settlement for them credit and sponsorship you did the private securities transaction this quarter what are some of the economics for you in these partnerships and transactions what are the balance sheet and income statement impacts as this progresses thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc its a very interesting cocollaboration agreement with figure were invested in the company as we publicly disclosed were very excited about working with the engineers over lets say when combining resources so were both combining our resources we believe theres a tremendous opportunity as we continue to beta test so we did a small transaction with them that was the beta test and it continues to develop that theres the solution on the blockchain on clearing through the aml the kyc process or the banking solutions at the same time being very cognizant of the regulatory needs out there to deal with the changing banking world so dealing with someone whos as innovative as mike and working with us and focused on looking at our balance sheet opportunities we think theres tremendous liquidity opportunity on the deposit side and we believe well be seeing some opportunities and ultimately potential lending opportunities and if you think about the big picture when you put nycb and flagstar together we believe that a lot of the business opportunities on mortgage banking mortgage lending will ultimately be on the blockchain so we think that the blockchain could really create a lot of efficiencies its really probably a more seamless way to do business when it comes to mortgage lending and were exploring with that both on the back end and in the front end so these are exciting times right now matt its beta testing in beta testing and automated testing and this is were not going to give out any business matches because its not going to be something we could speak to until we publicly launch an initiative so were still in a beta testing mode its been dynamic ill call it innovative and its exciting and were all hands on deck but clearly with a focus towards trying to find out what solutions i mean youre very familiar whats going on in the banking space and i think treasury i think that all regulatory world is trying to figure out how do we get this massive amount of liquidity out there to be amlkyc to the banking system and were working with them i think its exciting and again to the private flows and blockchain solution so theres a lot happening stay tuned and were excited to be partnering with them matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay and then last one for me in the past you discussed the combined entity new york community flagstar being able to generate doubledigit type loan growth and you touched on warehouse already but i feel like were going to have to see more significant multifamily and commercial real estate growth to get to that kind of level im just curious what the strategy is there to expand that business is it more new york city is it a nationwide strategy indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc great point were excited about it when the transaction closes ultimately we feel highly confident that when we have people in the field its going to be a cultural change right nycb does not lend on the field in any meaningful way flagstar has people theyre direct lenders so we have an indirect business with nycb they have a direct business with flagstar collectively were bringing out to the table substantial opportunities in new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 markets that are very robust new york we dont direct lend florida ohio the midwest theyre doing a great job on growing so we think we can have this opportunity here to put people on the field focusing on the positive growth and combination with ci with the right people and we are going to do this with precision as we hire up collectively as a combined entity to roll out a direct strategy direct and indirect will work together but we think theres some great growth opportunities at the same time we dont really run products to our branches so were taking all of the flagstar lending products and putting them we turn them on after legal day one and we have the opportunity to do business in our branches where our customers will have tremendously more products and thats the beginning so as we transition to truly a commercial banking enterprise with a wide array of products thats the opportunity that were all excited about so we feel highly confident between the fact that they are a mortgage player and a dominant mortgage player number six in origination number six in servicing number two top three in warehouse lending with a much bigger balance sheet if we could do a lot more there and these are exciting businesses because obviously its consumerrelated and were not a consumerfocused entity on a standalone basis so we think well have some good growth there in addition to a very strong ci presence matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc always a pleasure thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from steven duong of rbc capital markets please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steven steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys tom i guess maybe if we just get back to figure when you go to their white papers it looks like theyre achieving cost savings on the mortgage side of around basis points from the origination all the way through the securitization and when you bring on flagstar on there flagstar is pretty much touching on literally every part of that process and i guess have you guys started to size up roughly like how much of that basis points you could actually realize so like i dont know flagstar is doing basis points gain on sale is it possible for you to add on another basis points from this partnership with figure thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so let me just be clear and im going to turn this back to lee smith i will tell you that they have done a great job in flagstar to be relevant in the private label mortgage market right so what mike has done over at figure as theyve done transactions on the chain is a private label transaction theyre not through the agency right and thats the long term future but ultimately as we continue to be significant in the rmbs space lee smith has indicated fixed deals thats going to happen in q1 theyre going to do i think three or four deals in q4 but theyre i think top two or three in the country this year on rmbs these are sizable transactions if done new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 through the chain i think there will be reduced costs materially so i think theres opportunity there as you grow the business and i wouldnt underestimate that opportunity but in the meantime the frontend and the backend thats a long term solution when it comes to an agency player but the nonagency opportunity where large well it portfolio management buy these types of assets theyre very comfortable transacting on the chain so maybe lee if you want to maybe give some color as well to the opportunity obviously without putting numbers but just some big picture theory there lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc yeah no absolutely and good question steven look you cant put any numbers to it because its a new relationship for nycb we havent closed that deal as soon as we do we can start working on this more and trying to figure out and quantify the opportunity as you know with the blockchain blockchain is an ecosystem particularly if youre talking end to end mortgage and so the big numbers that you just quoted youre going to need a number of players within that ecosystem to start to realize some of those benefits as tom just alluded to as it relates specifically to rmbs and where the second biggest player in rmbs if you look at q3 theres some very discrete advantages so if you think that the blockchain is a trustless ledger you dont have to due diligence every single loan in an rmbs transaction if youre comfortable with the way the blockchain is working so theres obviously immediate savings from a due diligence point of view transfer and payment is instantaneous and so i think from an rmbs point of view that would be the more immediate opportunity but as tom said its very much in the early stages and the exploratory stages but its an opportunity and thats how were looking at it steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks i appreciate that lee and i guess just maybe just from your experience do you see this blockchain eventually leading to kind of like an overall industry shift on the cost front and do you guys see this as an opportunity being a first mover lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc possibly i mean look i think theres a lot of technology solutions out there and all mortgage companies are looking at ways to get more efficient do things quicker and improve the customer experience and if the blockchain enables that then thats a good thing theres a number of fintechs and technologies out there that were constantly looking at this is one of them and i know that tom and his team are doing the same on the new york community banking side so i think it is an opportunity and were plugged in and one of the frontrunners should it prove to be something that we and ultimately the industry can take advantage of steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc i appreciate that thank you and then just one last one for me just on the cds running off i guess just like the current rates right now on your cds like how low do you think they can get to and are the cds basically moving over into say savings accounts thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think thats probably the case i mean obviously were at a point now where weve enjoyed multiple years of expanding margins right since the shift of policy by the fed reserve and where rates are close to zero so i think were at a point now where the next billion coming due is still in the mid40 basis point so some are new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 going to savings some but i think lets just call it flat and thats i think thats the strategy here but ultimately the shift of culture into noninterest bearing the shift in culture to go after commercial customer accounts ph which i believe is our right as the lender and thats a cultural strategy shift that when forcing at the board level all the way down to the rank and file the team memberships and its working so i think that culture of the historical view of nycb thrift model is moving more towards the traditional commercial model that should drive the margin as well which i think will be significantly driven by the combination with flagstar thats what they do at the same time when you think about fixed rate lending versus floating rate its a very unique blended opportunity to bring these businesses together culturally and ultimately as we go out in the field and have direct lenders that go after those ci opportunities its deposit first lending second i think thats the cultural shift that were going through right now and were super excited to do it with sandro dinellos team because hes done a phenomenal job on growing it so were doing it together once we combine that were excited about that opportunity steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you tom i appreciate you taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is coming from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc chris how are you christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks hey tom good how are you could you or lee or sandro talk about the nonqualified market how much more opportunity exists here and is that another source of revenue as the merger closes thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i would sal do you want to handle that one salvatore j dimartino a managing director directorinvestor relations strategic planning new york community bancorp inc well i dont know the answer to that but i will tell you this and our history supports what im going to say if there is an opportunity there we will certainly jump on it and as lee mentioned in his comments the key i think to our mortgage business is that weve got a lot of different delivery channels and levers we can pull to take advantage of whatever the opportunity is out there so i dont know the answer im not going to speculate on how much of an opportunity there might be because i dont know what the market conditions are going to be but i know with full confidence that if there is an opportunity there we will seize it new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so i would just add to that point and sandro and lee im sure you want to chime in but assuming there is a real change in the slope of the curve and rates start to gravitate higher we will balance sheet residential lending we will balance sheet prime type loans on the portfolio we will have other products to utilize the balance sheet which will also and going back to my other point which i missed ph whether thats another contribution to potential growth of our assets by just being able to balance sheet high quality loans with portfolio as well and that tends to be the case when rates are in a different perspective and customers focus more on adjustable rate feature were very comfortable putting on indiscernible loans on the portfolio weve done it before very successfully and with flagstars distribution we could do it in a much more material way so maybe lee if you want to add more color to that lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc yeah no i think you covered most of that i was going to say if there is an opportunity we can take advantage of it we have the balance sheet we have the rmbs program so we have different ways that we can execute on these loans and different methods of either holding them or dispersing them and then as tom mentioned we have the sales force across multiple channels whether its tpos distributed retail direct lending and so if it is something that is an opportunity we can ramp up pretty quickly given the number of sales channels and sales teams that we have alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc and just to put a finer point on that comment we have very strong origination teams and channels in the higher cost areas of the country where that product is more likely to exist so principally part of what has grown through the opus advisors acquisition we did a few years ago we and as you can see from the securitizations weve done our access to those markets is very very very strong so to the extent again as i say that the opportunity is there well take advantage of it historically we have at times put those loans on our books as well but the private securitization opportunity in recent quarters has just been so interesting that weve gone that route but at times the market might not be as strong in which case thered be more consideration im talking about flagstar independent here where we would portfolio it you get into postmerger its a different dynamic because the balance sheets going to be much much bigger and much different than it looks like with just flagstar today christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you all for that background its really really helpful and tom just a final question when you look at the sort of stock repurchase opportunities postregulatory approval in closing is it still as good as you thought back in april when the merger was announced thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc oh look obviously we are very pleased with flagstars results theyve actually outperformed our internal forecasts when we sat down and talked about putting a couple together and perform at the company so on a common equity perspective then theres probably going to be more given the earnings profile which is very attractive for additional tangible value creation on the transaction the companies are going to earn on a combined basis a lot of money and were going to have a substantial reduction in our overall dividend payout ratio new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 because of that so well have more flexibility on capital management tools as i indicated in the previous quarters were not going to be talking about repurchases in the midst of the transaction but once the company has put its capital together and its earnings power we invest in people systems the business itself and at the same time paying a very strong dividend we will also consider the capital opportunities on the buybacks and clearly if the market is attractive for that we will consider all options but clearly this company is a different profile when it comes to capital generation when we enjoy the benefit of indiscernible capital they have significant capital on a standalone basis we have to pay a very large dividend collectively the blended payout ratio goes down materially and ultimately as i said their performance has been much better than we expected in that we remodeled and as we know from the original presentation of the deal we modeled a i think it was about a reduction in the mortgage business going into and obviously thats pretty severe so and it still generates significant earnings accretion with significant capital generation so were very pleased about where they are today and were looking forward to enjoying that opportunity in the future christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks tom i appreciate all your comments thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you at this time id like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments thomas robert cangemi director president
