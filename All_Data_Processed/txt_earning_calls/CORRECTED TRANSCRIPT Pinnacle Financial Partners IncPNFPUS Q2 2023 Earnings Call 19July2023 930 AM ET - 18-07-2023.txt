presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you paul those of you that have followed for a while know and expect im going to begin every quarterly earnings call with this dashboard of what we believe are the primary things that matter over time in terms of bank performance gaap measures first followed by the nongaap measures which provide the best insight into what i focus on and consequently what we focus on at pinnacle my guess is that as earnings continue to roll out well see some pretty wide variability in performance among the banks but for us was a really good quarter on an adjusted basis we grew revenues linked quarter annualized eps linked quarter annualized and pretax preprovision net income linked quarter annualized we continued the dramatic growth in loans and deposits at linked quarter annualized respectively which are generally the best predictors of our ability to continue growing revenue and earnings going forward tangible book value per share grew meaningfully during the quarter aided by a sale leaseback transaction that harold will review in greater detail shortly and the key asset quality metrics like npa classified assets and net chargeoffs continued to hold up extremely well so in summary second quarter was a great quarter for us now im going to let harold review the quarter in greater detail and ill come back and give some thoughts on the shares later harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody we will again start with deposits reporting linked quarter annualized average growth of and the second quarter was again a real positive for us as weve mentioned previously growing deposits in is a key focus and the second quarter was another indication that obtaining deposits in an environment where competitors can be fairly unpredictable is very much doable for this franchise several factors contributed to increased deposit rates in the second quarter competitive pressures were heightened during the quarter primarily from large regional banks offering rate specials at some fairly incredible rates in an apparent effort to achieve funding goals we also have an important public funds client base with much of these balances being tied to fed funds lastly the mix shift of reduced noninterestbearing to interest bearing continued in the second quarter albeit at a lesser pace all of these factors contribute to average deposit cost increasing to with a spot rate at quarter end of were optimistic about the pace of deposit rate increases as we head into the third quarter several factors to consider over the last few weeks our cost do not appear to be moving up at the same pace as we experienced at the end of the first quarter and most of the second quarter have contributed to this slower pace pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 and the slowing of the mix shift of deposits from noninterestbearing to interest bearing also we intend to reduce the absolute size of our more expensive wholesale funding base in the third quarter by absorbing some of the added liquidity which had been acquired over the last few months in other words we do not believe we need to be nearly as aggressive on gathering funding as we have been over the last few months deposit rates will continue to increase in the second half of this year as we hopefully approach a terminal value for fed funds we just believe with all the liquidity noise in the first half of the year a more deliberate stance for gathering deposits available to us as we move into the third quarter lastly in the supplemental slides is more information on uninsured deposits which are down to of total deposits at quarter end we wont go into this on the call but just making sure everyone knows the information is there the second quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us that said our line leadership successfully managed our loan growth down to the linked quarter annualized rate were maintaining our loan guidance for at low to midteens growth as we mentioned over the last several quarters weve tightened the credit box for construction and deployed more discipline on loan pricing which should serve to reduce our normally outsized growth spreads on floating and variable rate loans have continued to be very respectable we also are seeing spreads on fixed rate lending improved given emphasis by our line leadership our loan line thus far is essentially the same as the deposit beta which we believe reflects a great deal of effort on the part of our relationship managers our aim with respect to loan pricing is to maintain our spreads on floating and variable rate loans and achieve to plus yields on both new and renewed fixedrate paper as the top chart reflects our gaap nim decreased basis points which is more than we anticipated at the start of the quarter as we noted last quarter out of an abundance of caution our average liquidity increased by approximately billion in cash during the second quarter and our quarter end liquidity is slightly higher so we have a lot of cash going in the third quarter which should help us eliminate some wholesale funding as well as provide for loan growth in the second half of the year contributing to the cash build this quarter was the impact of the sale leaseback transactions we mentioned in a press release last night we received approximately million from the sale of nonearning fixed assets we also sold million from the sale of investment securities these two transactions allowed us to reposition underearning assets into interestbearing cash in order to eliminate the negative nearterm impact from increased lease cost our rate forecast is consistent with most rate forecasts out there were optimistic that a july raise by the fed is the terminal point for fed funds but we may be slightly more pessimistic and that we dont see rate decreases occurring until mid to late with that our forecast for the rest of is that quarterly net interest income will likely be flat to slightly up from the second quarter results as for credit we again are presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continued to perform very well in the second quarter our belief is that credit should remain fairly consistent for the remainder of this year we did increase the ratio of our allowance for credit losses to total loans during the quarter to we reworked several of our cecl models during the quarter and are implementing these changes this quarter we dont anticipate salary increases during the second half of any increases from this point should be fairly modest dependent we believe primarily on macro trends pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 as noted for the last few quarters we continue to have a very limited if any appetite for new construction also the cre appetite chart on the bottom right is basically unchanged from the prior quarter but does give you a real perspective on how we have reduced our appetite in commercial real estate over the last year or more in summary our outlook for a loan portfolio from a credit respective remain strong so if negative macro trends begin to develop we believe were advantaged as we enter any potential recession from a position of strength again and consistent with last time more information around credit the top left chart deals with trends in construction originations we began reducing eliminating our appetite for new construction originations last summer which is consistent with the chart the chart would indicate that our limited appetite is largely concentrated in warehouse multifamily and residential a quick note about new residential commitments the gold bars on the chart are new lines for new homes under old guidance lines for a limited set of long term residential builders we continue to support our resi builders under guidance lines that have been in place in some cases for years as you likely know residential builders are very busy right now given the state of the housing market and the lack of existing home inventories which is especially relevant in our markets which have a lot of inmigration from around the country secondly the chart on the top left top right we are providing updated information about the status of maturities for cre and construction fixed rate loans our yield target for these loans has increased into the to range two comments regarding this chart the absolute size of the fixed rate volumes coming up for renewal remains manageable and that with rental increases over the last years to years and occupancy levels remaining strong we believe that our borrowers will continue to be able to afford the incremental interest cost additionally our underwriting for several years has required that any new commercial real estate or construction commitment be underwritten at higher rates than the contract rate which in most cases is to basis points higher again we believe our borrowers have the resources to afford these increased rates both due to increased revenues on their part and based on our previous conclusions from our underwriting practices now onto fees and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding bhg the impact of the gain of sale fixed assets and the loss on the sale of investment securities fee revenues were up slightly from the first quarter that said were pleased with the effort of our feegenerating units during what is proving to be a challenging banking environment we continue to anticipate that fee revenues excluding bhg and all of these other items will come in at around a highsingledigit growth rate for over linked quarter expenses were essentially flat as personnel costs were down and other expenses were up by similar amounts seasonal decreases in payroll taxes and other benefit categories from the first quarter were the cause for the reduced personnel cost while the sale leaseback lease expense offset in part by reduced depreciation cost was the primary contributor to the increased occupancy cost additionally we reduced our anticipated annual cash incentive payout from to approximately of target awards at the end of the second quarter so not much change quarteroverquarter with respect to our outlook for incentive cost for either cash or equity incentives again the reduced incentive accrual speaks to the variable cost nature of our incentives which are all substantially performancebased additionally along with deferring projects or slowing our hiring we feel like we pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 have enough levers to throttle back on expenses should we need to we have again lowered our expense growth forecast for this year and have incorporated that into our updated outlook as it stands our expense guidance was previously low to midteens growth for we have lowered to high single digits to low teens growth for over our tangible book value per common share increased to at quarter end up influence of this increase was the saleleaseback transaction which provided almost million in pretax gains offset in part by million in securities losses in view of the macro environment we anticipate retaining this incremental capital at least through the end of this year we believe the actions weve taken to preserve tangible book value and our tangible capital ratio have served us well and have no plans currently to alter our tier capital stack via any sort of common or preferred offering the chart on the bottom left of the slide compares several capital ratios as of the end of march to our peers although we dont anticipate significant changes to the capital rules we are pleased with these results and our ability to withstand any changes to the capital rules that potentially could come our way now a few comments about bhg before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year the topright chart is consistent with various calls and details that production has been consistent over the last several quarters at billion to billion per quarter placements to the bank network were less in the second quarter while placements to institutional investors were at the highest level ever and it signaled that demand for bhg paper by some of the most respected asset managers in the country is really strong bhg has been able to penetrate a very liquid channel over the last few years which during some of these times has proven to be somewhat fickle for some of the bhgs competitors over the last several years bhg has made periodic calls to pivot between onbalance sheet investor paper and offbalance sheet bank placements historically as institutional investors come to the table their orders may receive a level of priority as to funding which bhg has to manage that said bhgs unique bank network which we believe cant be replicated by any other bhg competitor continues to grow and provide the necessary liquidity to bhg this is the new slide where were trying to provide additional clarity with regard to the significant funding channels available to bhg in replacement of their loan production whats new to the funding channel list is that in the second quarter bhg successfully negotiated two private whole loan sales with million of capacity these are slightly different and that in both cases these were large purchases structured similar to the bank network gain on sale treatment has afforded these sales as the investors acquired the loans with no recourse bhg has negotiated three warehouse loans with three wellknown and respected asset managers private equity firms performance of bhgs loans sold to the capital markets have been such that many of the firms that have participated in the past are in constant contact to acquire more loans in the future the bank auction platform remains very liquid and able to meet the necessary funding that bhg requires of it all in these funding channels collectively provide several billion dollars in capacity and the flexibility to manage liquidity risk effectively between the various channels this is the usual information weve shown in the past detailing spread trends just in a slightly different format the top chart represents the gain on sale of the off balance sheet bank network and the bottom chart is a blended chart of all balance sheet funding strategies which incorporates the historical buildup of balances as anticipated spreads have come in with higher rates with the bank auction rates being consistent with precovid spreads pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 during the second quarter the blended spreads for onbalance sheet were slightly higher than the bank network given the balance sheet loans reflect the buildup of balances over the last three years and as it stands today bhg expects spreads to be fairly consistent going into the second half of as we noted in the previous quarters bhg has tightened its credit box over the last several quarters particularly with respect to the lower tranches of its borrowing base this will have an impact on both production and spreads average fico scores in have increased to as weve stated in prior quarters bhg has been modifying their credit models towards originating less risky assets production volumes remain strong even with tighter credit underwriting bhg refreshes its credit store monthly always looking for indications of weakness in its borrowing base credit scores are up from previous years additionally approximately of bhgs production is with repeat borrowers adding to the quality of their loan base this slide details reserves and losses for both offbalance sheet and onbalance sheet loans as we mentioned in previous quarters bhg determined that loss rates in several lower tranches of their production was exceeding internal tolerances and elected to stop lending into these lower tranches their conclusion was that for loans written in and for most of several contained an element of rate inflation which required remediation as a result we believe outsized losses could occur over the next couple of quarters at a similar pace as the last two quarters typically for bhg approximately of the loss content is incurred within the first three years of origination but with rate inflation losses should come to light sooner as a result bhg has expended significant resources to bulk up collection activities including hiring more lawyers and will be instituting inperson closings for new borrowers which was suspended during covid bhg had another strong quarter with approximately billion in originations and are on track to achieve to achieve billion to billion originations this year which is slightly less than last year thus far through two quarters productions is slightly more than the prior year even with efforts to tighten the credit box bhg has a conservative bias that production in the last half of the year will likely be lower than the first half but should be close to what they had last year net earnings are being forecasted at million to million which is a tighter forecast from last year last quarters production of a to reduction from prior years results the numbers now work out to be a to reduction quickly again the usual slide detailing our current financial outlook for we continue to plan for a recession but how severe it will be neither we nor anyone else really knows our job is to manage the risk that face this franchise every day what we know is that our business model is relationship based nimble and resilient our management team has significant experience and have tackled economic downturns before we have great confidence that well be able to manage the high quality banking franchise that our shareholders have come to expect from us and can currently handle whatever curveballs get thrown out and with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks harold i mentioned at the outset that i would come back and offer my thoughts on the shares obviously the primary goal of the call is to have an indepth review of quarterly performance which weve now completed but beyond that we work hard to make sure that investors have an opportunity to understand more than just what went up and what went down during the quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 but to get to a better understanding of our approach for producing longterm shareholder value aka total shareholder returns or tsr so perhaps the best place to begin is just examine what kind of total shareholder return weve produced historically as you can see here over the last decade pnfp has produced the single best total shareholder return among peers and i invite you if you get a chance to go back and look at it since our inception in look at it over our first decade look at it over our second decade over the last years over the last years i think youd find us at or near the top in all of those time segments absolutely consistent performance irrespective of the various economic rate cycles over the last years and so what i wont examine now is how that happened the analyses of a number of banks stock experts and i suspect that yours would show that there are three primary metrics that are highly correlated to tsr over time and theyre revenue growth reported eps growth and tangible book value accretion i suppose that there are an infinite number of metrics that bear little or no correlation with tsr over time but they include metrics like net interest margin percentage cost of funds deposit cost betas loan yields noninterestbearing deposits total deposits operating leverage and efficiency ratios just to name a few in fact youve already seen our track record of total shareholder returns over the last decade yet im confident that our nim percentage has rarely if ever been above median our cost of funds has likely never been better than median our deposit beta is always high both when rates go up and when they come down loan yields have generally been no better than median and our noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits ratio has generally been less than most of our peers theres nothing wrong with any of those metrics in fact we measure and study all of them itd be hard to build a model without many of those inputs but im just making the point that we focus much more on growing revenues growing eps and accreting tangible book value than we do standard model inputs like the nim percentage or the cost beta or the percentage of noninterest bearing deposits to total deposits because historically revenue growth eps growth and tangible book value accretion have been more highly correlated with tsrs which honestly is the main thing i care about when i say we focus much more tightly on growing revenues growing eps and creating tangible book value heres what i mean most of you know a of our salaried associates participate in our annual cash incentive pool no annual cash incentive is paid to virtually any salaried associate in this firm if our classified asset ratio exceeds a certain level but assuming we had made a bunch of bad loans the metrics that determine virtually every salaried associates pay out including mine is the revenue growth and the eps growth rate since revenue growth and eps growth have been highly correlated with tsr we have literally focused every single salaried associate in this firm on those two variables and i believe thats one of the critical reasons our firm continues to compound revenue and earnings growth like few other can my personal incentive along with every other salaried associated in this firm depends on those two growth rates in terms of long term equity incentive plan of our associates are granted shares for most associates those shares are time vested but for the leadership team the top or so leaders in this firm including me the substantial majority of our recurring annual award vesting is performance based and the two primary managements are peer relative tangible book value accretion and peer relative roatce in other words for the leadership of this firm to maximize the vesting of the restricted share grants from our long term incentive plan beyond clearing an asset quality threshold which in this case is an npa ratio we have to outrun of the banks in our peer group in terms of the tangible book value accretion and roatce pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 parenthetically that might give you a little insight on why despite the extraordinary liquidity that we and virtually every other bank had on our balance sheet following the pandemic leadership of this firm did not close the bond book with when yields were at near alltime lows so heres how that plays out within the last five calendar years weve seen a covid pandemic quantitative easing a mammoth influx of liquidity from all the government stimulus in response to the pandemic inflation or cpi as high as the most precipitous increase in fed funds raised in recent history in addition to quantitative tightening and a dramatic increase excuse me a dramatic decrease in money supply and associated deposits and inverted yield curve and a number of failures at otherwise high flying banks and through all that on the upper right you can see the dramatic outperformance of our fiveyear eps growth versus peers on the lower left you can see that the primary driver of that eps growth was the dramatic growth in revenue per share regardless of all the macroeconomic volatility and then on the lower side you see the very dramatic compounding and tangible book value so i believe that continued compounding of revenue eps and tangible book value has been the primary contributor to producing the peer leading total shareholder return you saw several slides back so now when you begin to think about what the tsr chart is going to look like over the next five years or over the next years or over the next years you might begin here the southeastern markets we serve we have a dramatically different growth profile than the rest of the nation which has the potential to turbocharge our revenue and eps growth id hate to think i had the compound earnings and revenue at the pace we intend to in some of the other regions in this country but even more important than the dynamic growth that the markets we serve are likely to enjoy is the competitive advantage that weve built were a market share taker weve been one of the fastest growing banks over the last years and certain vibrant markets have certainly been a tailwind but you can be sure the substantially more important contributor to our growth has been our ability to take market share from vulnerable competitors what youre looking at here is market data produced by greenwich associates the foremost provider of research to us banks on the commercial market segment this is from their client satisfaction dashboard down the left side of the chart you see critical satisfaction variables based on their research things like ease of doing business being trustworthy valuing long term relationships creative insights the digital experience the quality of the relationship manager cash management capabilities and so forth as you can see by the scale at the bottom elements that are colored dark green are market leading elements that are colored red would be trailing or at the bottom of the market and the elements colored all the various shades from lighter green to yellow to orange are all scores in between the best and the worst so in the three rightmost columns you see pinnacle scores for all these important satisfaction metrics for small businesses as companys sales from million to million middle market businesses million to million in sales segment and then on the far right the combined score for the million to million in sales segment throughout our multistate footprint you know ive studied the chart very long to see that pinnacles market leader for virtually every single one of these metrics and this is critically important to understand these charts cover our entire footprint and compare the five or six market share leaders in addition to pinnacle including truist bank of america wells fargo pnc first citizens and first horizon i obviously dont know if greenwich could identify any other banks that dominate their markets overwhelmingly as we do but id be surprised across our footprint were far and away the market leader in terms of overall client satisfaction and the allimportant net promoter score pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 it seems to me the most important score of all is the net promoter score most of you know its a comparison of the number of clients that are so engaged with your brand that they fully intend to advocate for you with their friends and colleagues less the clients that are so disengaged with your brand that theyre detracting from your reputation in the community and you can see here our net promoter score is the league leading among small businesses companies with sales from million to million and a leading in the middle market companies with sales from million to million connecting this slide with the last regardless of all the money spent by our largest regional national competitors on technology and on the digital experience our clients rate our digital experience more highly than their clients rate theirs throughout our footprint so much has been said about a potential migration regional bank clients to the national providers when you look at these scores it should be apparent why we lost virtually no large clients following the silicon valley failure and why we continue to grow deposits at a dramatic pace in the aftermath look at the dramatic difference in net promoter scores between us at the top and our large national competitors at the bottom itd be very hard to leave a bank you absolutely love and honestly its not hard to leave a bank you hate some banks compete on price some just wait for a yield curve that suits your balance sheet but for us its this relentless pursuit of creating raving fans that explains our ability to grow revenue and eps almost regardless of the economic ups and downs so not surprisingly when greenwich probed businesses in our footprint about which banks are likely to earn a share of their business over the next months pinnacle is far and away the most frequent response as you can see at yearend of small business respondents named pinnacle and of middle market business respondents named pinnacle as the bank most likely to receive a share of their business thats an incredibly strong momentum and when greenwich probed clients regarding which banks are most at risk for losing a share of their business pinnacle was far and away the least frequently mentioned response consequently our net momentum of our businesses in our markets is market leading at and in two segments his further substantiation of the point ive been making about our relative lack of vulnerability versus the large national banks in our markets the thesis that regional banks are more vulnerable to the large national banks might be true for undifferentiated banks but business clients in these segments within our footprint might suggest otherwise given our net business momentum scores so really to sum it up what im trying to say is its our belief that revenue growth eps growth and tangible book value accretion have historically been most highly correlated with tsr thats why we focus our entire firm on it through our short term and long term incentives we believe our relationship based model has historically produced strong tsr with more manageable risks than many the proofs in the pudding when you think about the fact that the markets that we serve are likely to outperform the nation and the fact that weve got a demonstrably differentiated high touch and tech model that generally attracts more indiscernible less clients thats the key to compounding earnings over time irrespective of economic volatility well stop there operator and take questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions and the first question today is coming from jared shaw from wells fargo jared your line is live jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks for taking the questions i guess you know the deposit growth is great seeing that weve seen some deposit growth in some of your peers today as well where is that coming from is that really just the biggest national players or are you taking more wallet share from your existing customers i guess maybe just a little more detail on where that money is coming from and how much more runway you think there is to take that market share harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah jared thats a great question ill give you several things to think about one is weve got a lot of people weve hired over the last couple of years that are still out there bringing their clients to our firm i think also that when you get into this time of the year we start seeing seasonality play into our deposit book and so consequently we fully anticipate that well see swell here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then lastly our public funds weve won call it a handful of public fund clients here over the last quarter or so and theyre also building their balances in a more outsized way and in a more indiscernible that way m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jared i might add to harolds comments i think in terms of getting to where it comes from i think his first point is important the folks that we have hired the largest contributor of revenue producers to us has been truist the second largest has been wells fargo and so they are about consolidating relationships here based on their ability to serve clients better and so forth so anyway i think thats a big part of it but i wouldnt want it to be unsaid that i think if you were to come inside this firm and talk to people you would hear them say hey what were about to transition this firm from being one of the best asset generators to being one of the best deposit generators and so theres a lot of energy inside the firm on a number of different specialties that weve built ive mentioned them in the past deposit verticals that attack large pools of money where we have some valueadded product offering for things like property managers homeowners associations a variety of pools of money like that where weve got a valueadded product that weve introduced over the last couple of years pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 so those things have really good momentum and there are a number of other of those verticals that are being rolled out literally as we speak so again my hope and belief is youll see a little bit of a transition in our ability to gather beyond just the relationship approach that we that harold and i both commented on but also through those specialties jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great color thanks and then looking at the pace of hiring youve done a great job hiring people in market expansion how should we be thinking about your pace of hiring new revenue producers at this point and can you give an update on maybe some of the expansion markets that youve recently targeted m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i just i guess maybe start with the second part of it comment on the expansion markets that were in i think weve already given indications for the atlanta market that i think their commitments are about billion north of a billion in loan outstandings the more recent large market dc i believe that they have generally been a net provider of funding if you can believe that and generally in pretty short order approaching million in funding i think maybe about million in loan outstandings commitments are well above that and the momentum is really strong in both those markets i think if you were to talk to rob garcia or carolyne pelton that lead our effort in those markets they would say theyre enjoying great success both recruiting people and recruiting clients in large measure based on the strength of our treasury management capabilities and so forth so at any rate we continue to be excited about those expansions i think in terms of hiring people we continue to recruit i think we continue to do well my guess is we might not hire quite as many people this year as we did last year but well hire a lot theres still a lot of hiring momentum and i always try to hold out as a possibility that its conceivable to me we might find our way to a market extension or two in the event we feel like weve got a team that could build us a big bank youve heard us talk about that in the past were not just hiring anybody and were not trying to build an lpo but if we had the opportunity to build a big bank we would wed proceed with that and so anyway i hope im responding to your question there jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thats great thats great and then just finally for me maybe for harold how should we be thinking about or where cash balances go in the near term and then i guess from what you said we should just assume that any reduction in cash either goes directly to loan growth or just fhlb reduction any target harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats right its probably going to be around broker deposits weve got about call it upwards of billion that we think that we can use to kind of to help fund loan growth here in the over the year and also help reduce the size of our wholesale book jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 great thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc and it wont all happen at once it will happen consistently through the next six months and probably in the first part of next year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler stephen your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning thanks guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i guess one of the things im curious about is just the strength of the deposit base and youve spoken a lot about how you incent your people and noted that you feel like this has really been a shift but im guessing i guess im asking how has this shift really occurred have you had to change your incentives to drive that kind of culture shift towards deposits or is it really continuing to focus on revenue growth and telling these people if you want to book your loans you got to book the deposit first how can we think about that cultural migration i guess thats occurred m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah stephen thats a great question and i appreciate it because its important to me weve not changed our incentive at all and as you know im a believer im hoping im going to convince you to be a believer that when you get all the associates of this firm aimed at revenue growth and eps growth its not hard to illustrate at all guys weve got to buy more money or we cant book our loans guys weve got to buy more money at a lower price it is so easy to move our company to whatever really is important in order to grow the revenues and eps i think it would shock you how easy it is to illustrate how that works i think in the last quarterly allassociate meeting we just put a slide up there and show what the financial performance is and you show them okay look i think were all on our margin here and its largely a function of cost of funds and so then you go down and show on the expenses were right on track but dont miss the reason were on track is because we reduced our incentive accrual and so guys to be clear what just happened here in this quarter is we took money out of mine in your pocket and our incentive accrual and we put it in our clients pocket in terms of the rate we paid them on deposits pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 and so again we have not altered the incentive i doubt that were going to it is how were able to move people back and forth not that were constrained by it stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thats very helpful thanks terry and then i guess in terms of the margin outlook i think harold you guys give the cost of deposit at june im not sure if you gave like a june or end of period kind of margin relative to where the margin was for the quarter as a whole but how do you think about incremental progression and compression from here and can you speak to the amount of floors you might have in the loan book if and when we get rates lower harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah weve got loans weve got floors on loans and were pulling were pushing for floors on loans were also pushing for folks to be very cautious about what rates theyre paying on their deposits i think we can be more deliberate with respect to our deposit rates as we go into the second half of the year as to margin performance in the third and fourth quarter its going to be down in all likelihood we think theres one more rate increase coming to us that well have to support in some way with our depositors but that said dont miss we think our net interest income is likely to be flat up so as terry said were going to be focused on the revenue line and were going to try to make sure that we dont sacrifice any of the ground that weve gained here over the last call it two or three quarters with respect to some of these clients that weve gathered so ill stop there stephen and see if i have gotten to your question stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah and i think that makes a lot of sense i think it speaks to that slide you guys had in maybe a year ago where you showed your deposit betas but your nii outperformance irrespective of those deposit betas i think thats a good point maybe just lastly for me around the new hires you had some particular strength in wealth management can you give us a view on where kind of those new hires have been concentrated and i guess have more of them been into that wealth management platform over time is that driven some of the strength there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well theres no doubt that we have hired a good number of people in the wealth management segment and its really across the wealth management segment when i say that i mean a lot of hiring in trust which believe it or not its a doubledigit growth business for us as well as hiring in brokerage as well as hiring what some might refer to as private bankers they are relationship managers that are focused on wealthy individual so weve had hiring across all those segments i think that we probably have had a little more hiring in the wealth management segment over the last year or so year or two than is normal but i dont think thats necessarily by design i think it is more availability of people and so again we just had as you know what we do is try to aim at high producers that are frustrated in the organizations that they work for so i think theres sort of been elevated frustration there which has fueled our ability to hire people i wouldnt look for that to be the ongoing norm at all i pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 would say i wouldnt expect much different about the hiring mix in as an example than i would have expected in stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it extremely helpful guys appreciate all the color and keep up the good work indiscernible operator thank you the next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so you had favorable commentary in terms of the outflows of noninterestbearing starting to abate and then even the pace of deposit increase starting to abate you also cited harold i think you said the competitive environment is unpredictable is that a function of the competition lessening that you saw are you starting to see that abate a bit maybe you could drill down a little bit into what gives you a comfort here harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think its primarily around the trends when we watch our deposit book of about every day over the last call it days days it feels like the pace is slower it feels like the calls coming into our units is less anxious its theres a lot more opportunity coming from some of the new hires that weve had around deposit gathering those sort of things terry and i were talking about pricebased competitors before we start this before we started the call today what i believe is pricedbased competitors generally thats a shortterm phenomenon eventually they have to go back to whatevers necessary to create the profit margins they need to have and we feel like that a lot of this recent activity from some of these regional competitors will have to be short lived i dont think that they can be competitive at the rates theyre offering and so consequently and hopefully that competitive kind of environment weve been in will also abate to some extent i can be completely wrong on that but i think history is that price competitors cant be price competitors for a long period of time steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah yeah thats helpful harold on the expenses i appreciate taking down the expense guidance and outlook a bit but where we stand today whats your bias in terms of where you think right now i know theres a lot of variables where youll likely end up in this highsingledigit to low teens percent increase range pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc on expenses steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think if you were to just kind of twist my arm and put it behind my back and make me really be in pain id have to go probably to a call it to somewhere in that neighborhood steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect thats helpful and then final question from me in terms of the saleleaseback harold could you walk us through the pl impact on a goforward basis from the transaction just want to make sure harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah just from feet my lease expense less the depreciation savings from selling those properties is probably over a 12month period about call it a million kind of additional rate run rate increase but the cash that were able to generate from moving the million in fixed assets from to now call it and the cash we generated from taking investment securities million of those from call it to to now that increase in yield basically offsets all of the depreciate i mean all the lease expense increase and just to be completely candid around the saleleaseback when we started looking at this back in the fourth quarter of last year the kind of the play was that we would reposition more of the bond book and consequently we thought we could probably reposition as much as another call it million or million in bonds with the gain we got on the sale leaseback but with all the activity in the first quarter and now going into the second quarter and whether or not theres going to be a recession or not we elected just to warehouse the capital that we created from the gain steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so the benefit is you create excess capital from an overall earnings view its fairly neutral moving forward harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats exactly the point and thats basically why we did the sale of the investment securities is to neutralize the impact of the lease expense steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator thank you the next question is coming from brandon king from truist securities brandon your line is live brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to get updated assumptions on deposit mix including you guide i know harold you mentioned previously that by yearend we could get to below so i wanted to see if you still feel comfortable with that sort of trajectory just given where things stand today harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think we still feel like that thats a reasonable kind of number to put on the board i dont think we or anybody else brandon has any idea where noninterestbearing deposits are going to go here in this environment but it does seem like things are feeling better about that and that were at the end of the day the two things have to be in play one is our clients have to get to a level of operating cash where they feel like i need this in an operating cash account and on our side our salesforce our people our treasury management people have to talk to our clients about this seems to be a real a reasonable amount for you to keep in this deposit account that you need to manage your business and so i think those conversations are occurring every day and i think it just leans into this relationshipbased model that we continue to kind of hold on to as while we think this whole noninterest bearing reduction is feeling better for us brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it makes sense and then i wanted to talk about the allowance increase in the quarter and i understand the increase in commercial real estate but i saw that consumer real estate had a pretty sizable jump as well so just want to see if theres any context around that increase pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the increase in the consumer real estate allocation is primarily related to the macro case and the duration of those assets so were not going to argue about whether or not were a big fan of cecl or not but at the end of the day when rates go up and those assets extend out then the cecl model automatically penalizes those loans and the decisions you made on those loans back several years ago does that make sense to you brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah so nothing kind of qualitative there just purely quantitative harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so to be honest i cant remember the last time we had any kind of loss on a to residential fixed rate mortgage brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay got it just confirming thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw catherine your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i want to circle back to the margin and extend just your thoughts into next year and its helpful to think about or youve given guidance that you think nii is still flat to up in the back half of the year but as we think about and lets just say we get a hike in july and then were at that level of fed funds so we dont get rate cuts as we move into next year how do you think about how your nii might look next year in kind of a higher for a longer scenario harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well i think a one big factor in that assumption would be what does the intermediate long end of the curve do as you know no banker is a fan of an inverted curve and so it just going to its going to require a lot more work on our part in front of our salesforce and how we price with clients and all that sort of stuff so so far we dont think credit is going to be up we dont see that moving going into we think were wellpositioned there but as far as our ability to grow net interest income in kind of a midteens level it would be very hard as we look at but it all depends on what we believe is going to happen at the intermediate long end of the curve pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and so and as you get to a point where you think nii growth might pull back to maybe the low teen maybe on a highsingledigit kind of pace in that scenario how quickly do you think youll reconsider the expense growth going into next year to be at a lower pace kind of like what we saw this quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question well have to well have to consider a lot of things going into the expense book next year one would be replenishment of our incentive cost whatever that ends up being for and going back to trying to figure out how to achieve a full incentive again next year and then where we are with respect to hiring were today were today we are call it very conservative on our what we would call our support level positions where were not as far as revenue producers we still are out there actively looking for revenue producers weve asked our support units to kind of hold it in and do what they need to do in order to meet whatever objectives they have internally but not to indiscernible on their hiring catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc ill just leave it with that catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay yeah thats great thats very helpful and then maybe just one followup on credit it seems like the guidance feels like loan growth should still be strong but slow a little bit in the back half of the year relative to the first half and it didnt feel like you expect a big increase in the reserve ratio maybe just a modest and so is it fair to assume outside of some unexpected change in what youre seeing on the credit front that the absolute dollar number of the provision expense should be lower in the back half of the year relative to the 30some million number we saw this quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes yeah we dont anticipate provision being that in the second half as it was in the second quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking my question harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc sure operator thank you the next question is coming from matt olney from stephens matt your line of live matt olney q analyst stephens inc thank you i want to make sure i understand the strategy on liquidity it sounds like the excess liquidity amount as you view this is around billion and you want to be patient deploying this could take up to a year did i get that right and then i guess kind of part two the broker deposits that could be paid down that you mentioned harold any more color on these products are these cds and when do they start to roll thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah they will roll off over the call it the next six months ive got some public fund money that i think well also be paying off over the next six months so itll be those kind of things i dont think itll take a year i think its more like probably six to seven eight months matt if i remember my maturity schedule is kind of where were looking at on this liquidity number matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and then i guess kind of part two of that and thinking about the interest rate sensitivity on that i think its on slide of your deck there where do you see that migrating over the next year especially as we get closer to any kind of fed funds cut i would assume as you to put out liquidity the bank would become more rate neutral but just curious kind of how you see that moving over the next year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i think youre exactly right on that i think once we get to a terminal value on fed funds i think our sensitivity will get kind of go back to historical norms there will likely be deposit creep but it wont be in leaps and bounds itll be in small numbers but well also have the advantage of repricing fixed rate loans going into kind of a kind of on stabilized rate environment if there is such a thing matt olney q analyst stephens inc yes okay okay thats helpful and then just lastly on the loan growth front youve talked about managing the growth lower in recent months and being more selective and very careful im also surprised that you didnt take down a loan growth guidance this quarter it looks like the fullyear guidance implies will be flattish from what we saw in can you just kind of speak to the pipelines as far as what youre seeing today and currently versus a few months ago pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah matt i think you know our approach well so much of the loan growth is generated by the consolidation of banking relationships by new hires and that phenomenon occurs sort of irrespective of whatever other economic factors exist and some people say well why dont you just take it to zero well thats no good for anybody i mean you know we hire people they have clients they need to move them or otherwise they wont be their clients anymore and so at any rate that fuels some of the growth what we do i think to harolds point is we use pricing which curves things on the margin weve said as an asset class constructions asset class we want less obvious things like hlts and those kinds of things and so theyre marginal changes that are really what tamp down the growth but in terms of what the economic loan demand looks like i would say that that is having an impact i do believe that pure economic loan request that we see today would be easily less than what they would have been a quarter or two ago matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc both cre and ci matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc all right thats helpful terry thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah operator thank you the next question is coming from brody preston from ubs brody your line is live brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask just if i could start on the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio i just want to ask if you knew what the dollar amount of fixed rate loans that were repricing over the next months were and then when i kind of go back to your previous decks it looks like fixed rate origination yields were about to about four fourandahalf years ago is that a good yield to use when we think about whats rolling off the book for fixed rate loans right now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brody i dont have what the fixed rate maturities in the ci book are with me i just got whats in the commercial real estate and construction book on the slide but i wouldnt imagine that the yield difference would be terribly different between whats in the commercial real estate versus the ci book i just dont know what the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 volume would be with respect to that most of my ci book is floating or variable and so i mean it would be slightly higher but i dont know how much more brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so i can just use that cre portion as a proxy also on that just on the negotiated deposit book i wanted to ask just what portion of that book has recently renegotiated on rate and for those that have recently renegotiated where are the new rates moving to harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think that number would be in the mid somewhere in that range and i would imagine a substantial amount of that book has been renegotiated ive not seen a bell curve of my deposit book lately where you track like what the rate is the low rates versus the high rates and all that but substantially all of those deposits have repriced in one way shape or form brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you and on the sale leaseback transaction do you happen to know what the cap rate was on that transaction for the buyer harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i really dont that would be an interesting thing to know but i dont brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then you did have million or just under million of fixed rate cre and construction loans that were maturing in the second quarter at least for the slide deck last time i wanted to ask just what happened to those loans did they reup with you at your targeted rate did any of them leave the bank and i guess did any of them struggle with the increase in rate harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc ill go back and look at my numbers but i think there was only a small percentage that left the bank i think probably a third maybe to a third left the bank and went to the indiscernible market i think the rest are probably still hanging with us brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and just a couple last ones on the afs portfolio do you happen to know what the effective duration of that portfolio is and what the conditional prepayment rate youre assuming in that duration calculation harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think the average life of afs book if youre talking about years is that right pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc or youre talking about percentage brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think the life in the afs book now is somewhere around eight and the percentage duration i think is around brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay do you know what the cpr is in that duration calculation harold harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont but i can get that for you brody and ill get it to you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome i appreciate it and then just last one just i think you might have touched on it earlier but im sorry if i misheard you just the increase in the cre reserve was there anything like was there any specific kind of metric that drove that increase within your cecl model just because it had been declining for the last several quarters harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no i cant point to any kind of anything specific in the cre book theres no individual loans in there that contributed to it or anything like that i dont know of anything brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i was more interested in harold within the acl modeling if there was any specific variable where maybe there was a larger price decline that you were factoring in within the acl modeling i just thats what i was more getting at harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so really i dont know the answer to that question if there was one i dont think there is one pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great well thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brody operator thank you the next question is coming from brian martin from janney montgomery brian your line is live brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey guys most of my stuff was just asked in the last couple of questions but just one thing harold you gave a spot rate on i think deposits just do you have what the spot rate was on the margin at the end of the quarter or just or it just sounds as though its going to go you talked about the dollars of net interest income because the margin itself is going to drop the next couple of quarters maybe stabilize later in the year is that based on kind of your outlook on rates today is that fair harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats fair i dont have my monthly financial information in front of me but we think its going to the margin will decline over the next couple of quarters but again our focus is on that net interest income number that we think is flat to up brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yep got you okay and then liquidity normalizes by end of year thats kind of what youre suggesting thats six or seven months or so harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think well be close by the end of the year brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay all right and then just last to just on bhg just kind of the outlook narrowed a little bit more just as we think about any high level how we should be thinking about bhg next year harold with depending on how these losses potentially play out or i dont know if cecl is in there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i would not first of all were not giving guidance on but at the same time i think bhgs outsized growth rates from over the last several years and depending on which one you look at i think theyll become a lot more normalized going into pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay all right perfect thats all i had thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brian operator thank you and we have another question coming in from jared shaw from wells fargo jared your line is live jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey thanks just a quick followup on the bhg you know you called out the loan sales to the institutional investors were those also covered under a substitution agreement or when you say theres no recourse thats just truly no recourse theyre off the balance sheet and any losses will be absorbed by those borrowers or purchasers m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thats right thats right from my understanding is they bought those loans and theyre theirs jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc the gain on those wasnt quite at the same level but at the same time they dont have the recourse jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay
