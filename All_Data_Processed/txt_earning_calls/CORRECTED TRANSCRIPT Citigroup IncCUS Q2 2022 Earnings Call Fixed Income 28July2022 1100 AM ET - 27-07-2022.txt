instructions for the questionandanswer session also as a reminder this conference is being recorded today if you have any objections please disconnect at this time mr demoise you may begin peter demoise analyst citigroup inc thank you operator and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings with that said let me turn it over to mike michael verdeschi treasurer citigroup inc thank you peter and good morning everyone on todays call i will cover a number of topics first ill briefly discuss our second quarter operating results which we feel good about especially given the operating environment second i will cover recent balance sheet trends including our robust liquidity and capital position third i will share some thoughts on what our issuance activity might look like over the nearterm and then mark and i would be happy to take your questions but before i discuss the highlights of the quarter in more detail i do want to spend a moment reflecting on the current macro and geopolitical environment which remains complex and uncertain us consumer and corporate balance sheets remain healthy but the risk of a recession particularly abroad has increased that said we feel very good about our balance sheet with strong capital liquidity and ample reserves all of which position us well to weather any number of economic scenarios continue to serve our clients and execute on the strategy we laid out at investor day with that lets turn our attention to citis operating results slide covers some of the highlights from the quarter we executed on our strategy with revenues up year over year which benefited from higher rates and continued strong client engagement especially across markets and services we increased deposits maintained robust liquidity and grew our capital base positioning us well to meet our increased scb and gsib requirements in the coming quarters which ill talk more about in a moment citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 slide outlines our second quarter results in more detail in the second quarter we reported net income of billion and an rotce of on billion of revenue net income was up sequentially on strong growth in net interest income but down year over year largely driven by the absence of a large acl release in the prior year period on slide we show key capital and liquidity metrics and our average balance sheet we saw both advanced and standardized riskweighted assets come down both year over year and sequentially as we continue to optimize rwa we ended the quarter with a standardized cet1 ratio of approximately which is approximately basis points higher than the first quarter and about basis points above our current regulatory requirement of going forward we expect our regulatory requirement to increase to in october to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer in january our regulatory requirement will increase to as a result of an increase in our gsib surcharge the combination of earnings generation closing of divestitures and continued rwa optimization will be important tools as we manage toward this higher cet1 requirement on the bottom left you can see that we continue to maintain strong liquidity levels with billion of average highquality liquid assets or of citis average total assets supporting a healthy lcr total assets increased year over year on higher tradingrelated assets reflecting a continuation of strong client engagement slide presents trends in our loan portfolio over the past five quarters total average citigroup loans decreased year over year as growth in pbwm and icg was more than offset by a decline in legacy franchises in pbwm average loans increased year over year largely driven by growth in branded cards and retail services in icg average loans increased year over year largely driven by growth in trade finance and as expected legacy franchise loans continued to decline largely driven by the reclassification of loans to heldfor sale turning to slide we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters total average citigroup deposits were relatively flat year over year as growth in pbwm and icg was offset by declines in legacy franchises and corpother in pbwm average deposits increased year over year driven by growth across retail and wealth in icg average deposits increased year over year driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions and despite the industry pressure from quantitative tightening weve remained very focused on growing operating deposits and expect modest deposit growth for the full year on slide we provide an update of our lcr metric and drivers our average lcr remained relatively stable at now let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide so far this year we have issued roughly billion and we were pleased to issue an affordable housing bond and we continue to diversify the syndicate group and our debt issuance across underrepresented groups going forward well continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors currencies and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and support our clients on slide we show the composition of our longterm debt outstanding our total longterm debt on an endof period basis decreased by approximately billion to roughly billion this decrease reflects the optimization of funding in the bank as we continue to maintain robust deposit levels citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 on slide let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectations as you can see in the middle of the slide we have issued billion of benchmark debt so far this year at this point we estimate that we could potentially issue up to an additional billion over the second half of this year depending on how our needs and opportunities evolve so this would translate into approximately billion to billion of issuance for the full year moving to our last slide let me summarize several key points the franchise continues to perform well through this period of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty we remain committed to the strategy outlined at investor day and are seeing it play out in our results we earned over billion of net income in the second quarter we maintain a strong capital position with a standardized cet1 capital ratio of an slr of and a surplus above our tlac requirement we also maintain a strong liquidity position with an average lcr of over billion of available liquidity resources and we are comfortably in compliance with the nsfr rule which became effective last year before we move on to qa let me touch briefly on libor as you may know federal legislation was signed into law earlier this year that provides a solution for legacy libor instruments importantly we expect the legislation to apply to all of citis outstanding usdollar liborbased securities without appropriate fallbacks we are obviously pleased with the industry solution that this outcome provides and look forward to seeing the final rule and with that mark and i will be happy to answer your questions thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from scott cavanagh with apg your line is now open scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc good morning guys and thanks once again for the call a couple of questions for you first of all on the funding guidance could you just walk us through the potential uptick of billion for the remainder of the year and then ive got another question michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure good morning scott thanks for the question maybe ill just start with how we were thinking about the first half and then ill address your question about the up to billion of issuance for the first half there were a number of factors weve had an evolving macro backdrop with quite a bit of volatility in the markets and with market conditions being uncertain and our needs evolving we aim to issue more than we had originally planned and in addition on the back of that volatility came good client engagement so really the first half was about a combination of need but also being opportunistic in accessing markets in the first half citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 when i think about the second half a lot of those same items are on our minds so when i think about the ongoing volatility were leaving ourselves the flexibility to meet our needs but also to continue to be opportunistic i mentioned that client engagement aspect that will remain an important driver in what our needs are and how they play out over the course of the year but also in addition when i look out at we do have another billion maturing in that year so really its about leaving ourselves flexibility i would say in an evolving and certainly uncertain market environment scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc thanks for the color then just switching gears over here to credit card could you guys give us your thoughts on the pending bill that was the wall street journal article and the bloomberg article noted today and yesterday and then on asset quality for credit card could you just walk us what youre seeing globally and then domestically what youre seeing in between retail and branded mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc let me kind of start and just in terms of the overall performance that weve seen particularly in the cards portfolio weve been very pleased with the progress that weve made in the quarter there as you know weve been investing particularly in marketing and acquisitions across both the branded cards and retail services portfolio and weve seen that play out in good new acquisition momentum we saw average interestearning balances play out through the quarter particularly on the branded cards side and so were starting to see that loan growth that drives top line momentum a bit earlier than ive talked about in the past so in the second quarter and we expect that to continue in the back half of the year as we look at the underlying performance particularly in this environment where there is a fair amount of uncertainty for all the reasons mentioned before were not seeing any particular concerns around the credit quality in the cards portfolios the losses if you look at our loss rates remain very low and probably half the levels of what i would have talked about would be in a what we would see in a normal part of the cycle so continued good performance there when i look at through the portfolio across fico scores and the like no particular areas of concern for new acquisitions maybe a little bit of an uptick in terms of slight delinquencies in the new acquisitions with the low fico scores but nothing abnormal or that would raise alarm there and then even when i look at the activity purchase sales remains very strong through both portfolios and payment rates remain quite strong as well and so as i think about that i feel very good about the performance there and about the ability to manage the risk and the first part of your question again scott operator scott your line is now open scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc sorry i just wanted to go into depth on what details you could provide us on the pending bill talking about the card networks thats being contemplated in the senate citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah were still obviously looking through that and working through that as a management team so i dont have any additional color to provide on that at this point in time weve obviously seen whats out there in terms of credit card networks and merchant fees and the like and well continue to kind of work with partners to assess that operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from peter troisi with barclays your line is now open peter troisi q analyst barclays capital inc hi good morning just another question on funding just wondering how actively youre using the abs market for overall funding needs and maybe if you can give us a sense for how much of the benchmark issuance that you show on the slides last year and in the first half related to abs michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hi peter good morning weve not been active in that market in fact over the past year weve allowed that to run down to some degree and i think thats been a broader theme with our bank funding levers obviously weve seen and the industry has seen good deposit growth over recent years and so that really has meant that weve brought down a lot of that bank funding lever so but that being said as we think about quantitative tightening and how that is already underway and the pace picking up later this year depending on how our balance sheet evolves obviously we still expect as weve talked about modest deposit growth but you could see us begin to leg in and normalize our overall funding profile obviously much and most really coming from deposits but of course taking advantage of some of that lowcost funding that may come in some of those bank levers things like fhlb or even in the assetbacked space that you mentioned but in this past year no weve not utilized that peter troisi q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks for that and the fhlb funding and the abs you just walked through is that contemplated in the zero to billion of potentially incremental issuance for the rest of the year michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc again that billion is really meant to provide us flexibility and again well see how our balance sheet needs evolve in addition to remaining opportunistic so yes that could apply to both the parent benchmark as well as opportunities that we may see in the bank operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from jesse rosenthal with credit suisse sic creditsights your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc good morning guys thanks for the call as always ive got a quick question on the preferreds so you have about billion coming callable over the next year i think theyre all floatingrate libor theres a couple with pretty hefty back ends im just wondering how youre thinking about potential refinance opportunities in this type of market and basically is there more of a willingness on the part of the issuer to extend even if the coupons resetting are fairly high just based on where the forward curve is showing and not wanting to lock in a new non callfive at relatively high rates and any color on how youre thinking about the prefs in this market would be helpful michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hi good morning jesse so weve talked about this in the past how we think about press and the upcoming calls and i dont think our thinking has really evolved on this from the perspective of as these calls are coming due were going to be looking at that call date and looking in the mediumterm as well and evaluating our need for that capital and then of course if we do in fact need that capital were going to look at the economics associated with leaving that security outstanding versus calling it and replacing it in the marketplace and you asked a question about the fixed rate really yes that would be a factor of course were going to be looking at the credit component as well spreads and so we will look at that overall economic tradeoff between calling it versus leaving it outstanding operator thank you our next question will come from robert smalley with ubs your line is now open robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and thanks for doing the call i have two topics first following up on some of the financing questions could we step back for a second and do or could you give us some bottomup type of color on how you came to the up to billion number what specifically will this be funding where do you see some variances there what informed you to come to the billion number specifically piecebypiece thats the first part of my question and also were there any other impacts deposit data impacts or impacts from security portfolios switching from afs to heldtomaturity that reduced any available liquidity thats my first question michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hi there so let me start with that last part of that question and so when we think about the securities portfolio and the use of afs versus htm that is really a focus on ensuring that were optimizing that securities portfolio and being mindful of the oci atrisk and ill remind you that afs portfolio the valuation changes does impact that cet1 and so changes in that valuation of afs does impact that cet1 ratio and can cause volatility obviously the selection in htm is meant to minimize that volatility but importantly these are very the vast majority is going to be treasuries and agency mbs those are very liquid securities and so we retain the option of course to finance those and access the repo markets so it citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 doesnt really change our funding profile in that you can still access those markets now keep in mind that these securities predominantly are held in the bank where we have an enormous amount of deposit funding but again that is not a driver of how we think about the issuance just getting to that billion number again when i think about what we issued in that first half billion and as i mentioned as i think about providing flexibility we have billion maturing and again that becomes one consideration but also we want the flexibility to be opportunistic and look were going to have to see how our balance sheet evolves and how our client engagement evolves so i would say there wasnt any precise breakdown of that number other than us providing ourselves flexibility were trying to do our best to give you some sense in terms of the guidance but again its hard to that with any level of precision especially in an environment that is evolving and has certainly a high amount of volatility in the market mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think your last point mike is particularly key this is an uncertain evolving environment weve got a very strong balance sheet that we feel very good about we want to make sure that we maintain flexibility to support our clients as their needs evolve and to maintain that strength in the balance sheet that we have today and so were being completely transparent with how were thinking about it and well continue to do that in the coming quarters and youll see the actions that we take accordingly inside of this range robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc okay that helps and then as a followup and maybe its more of the same question but when i look at the slr youre comfortable at do you see gross balance sheet growth decreasing increasing or staying the same through the rest of this year and into next year or can we even tell at this point and i know you answered a question on prefs earlier but if we see that number start to drift down to will we see some preferred issuance michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc i think over the remainder of the year as weve talked about we would still expect to see modest deposit growth were still looking at spending in cards as well as loan growth more generally so we would expect the balance sheet to continue to grow but in terms of that leverage again were comfortable where we are we dont think that growth is really going to pressure that leverage ratio that being said if we did need to we would come to the market for that but that really hasnt been a factor for us it hasnt been binding but to answer your question we are expecting that balance sheet to grow mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc consistent with our client demands consistent with the strategy we talked about at investor day that over time delivers improved returns which is what were here to do operator thank you our next question will come from kevin maloney with blackrock your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc thanks for taking my question mike on deposits you mentioned that you expect them to grow moderately for the rest of the year and clearly they were down from modestly and just thinking about where you think that growth is going to come from tts business is clearly marketdriven but if you could give us any color that would be great michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc so kevin again our thoughts are on the full year basis probably that you do see that growth look i think theres a number of things obviously our strategy in the businesses that were operating in that we believe that the relationshipbased nature of those activities mean that especially as you see a quantitative tightening unfolding that perhaps those deposits that are less relationshipdriven are the areas that could be impacted by that quantitative tightening but again just given our strategy and the relationshipbased nature of those deposits really do factor into our thinking about how those deposits will evolve over time mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc if you think about our icg business right where we talk a lot about our tts franchise the multinational clients the middle market commercial clients that were serving there that is about their operating accounts and continuing to work with them to bring them the breadth of the franchise while growing the deposits that represent their operating account activity is part of where we expect to see continued momentum if you think about the pbwm business where weve talked about the importance of wealth weve talked about the importance of small business activity the nature of those highend consumers that were covering again by bringing on new advisors by bringing on new accounts into that wealth business we expect to see continued momentum there so while quantitative tightening will certainly come with some pressure as we look through the portfolio with the quality deposits that were looking to grow we expect to see continued growth come through kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc great thank you as a followup question on page you had a nice table dictating or suggesting the net interest income walk for the second half of this year and just well im wondering how you think youre going to well this is actually last year but how do you think its going to grow in the forthcoming second half of this year is it really driven by rates or driven by market growth meaning balance sheet growth mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so again ill start that and mike feel free to chime in so what we look to do here and i mentioned it on the earnings call was to really give a little bit of guidance as to the total revenue that weve been talking about since investor day but to break that down for the investor community into nii guidance and so here ive tried to put or we tried to put what the first half looked like juxtaposed against the prior year and then specifically speak to what we were expecting in the second half excluding markets given how hard it is to forecast markets and certainly a breakout of markets thats going to be a combination of both the interest rate environment that we are managing through and continuing to see rate hikes play through there and some of the volume growth that weve seen over the course citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 of the year already continuing to contribute in the back half of the year and as you heard me mention earlier in parts of the business like cards for example where we started to see some of that average interestearning balance growth come to play in the second quarter we still expect that to play out in the back half of the year as well and so factors like that will be important contributors to the nii growth of the billion that i mentioned here operator thank you our next question will come from arnold kakuda with bloomberg intelligence your line is now open arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research thanks guys i think you guys have won q2 earnings this period what really helped is strength in trading particularly fixed income but is it fair to say that kind of that strength in fixed income and trading that may be part of the factor in terms of why maybe issuance might need to pick up again in the second half of the year trading continuing to be positive in a volatile environment but thats heavily funded with debt so is that if we can hone in kind of on this billion of potential actual issuance could you say that could be a reason why you kind of upped potentially upped the guidance range on that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah so look its really any number of factors when we think about that client engagement and certainly what we issued out of the parent thats going to be in our nonbank activities as we thought about it so certainly some of that nonbank funding theres multiple sources theres going to be of course repo financing one of the complements to our funding profile in the nonbank are the client notes as well but of course well issue our benchmark there too so that volatility of course this environment has played well through the capabilities in our markets business and well just have to see how the second half plays out and how our funding needs evolve and how we best optimize that funding profile to meet those needs arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research okay great thanks thats helpful switching gear to cet1 levels and your targets obviously next few quarters higher cet1 requirements basis points and all on scb and gsib and thats whats caused you to raise your target to it was interesting to see that you i could see that kind of all rolling back in the midterm so is it fair to say that kind of the planned asset sales or exits over the next i guess one to two three years thats going to help you kind of get the balance sheet kind of get that down a little bit and focus more on wealth management more steady revenues those things could help impact your gsib and seb lets say by is that fair to say mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look i think there are a number of factors so obviously in the quarter we built up our cet1 from the prior quarter to the youre right we do have some headwinds in the way of the scb and the gsib score and frankly i think the industry saw those headwinds as well play out with some of the results from dfast citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 as we think about our business there are a couple of things that i think allow for us to build up to that and then contribute to what we think of as a mediumterm level so the buildup obviously would include the earnings generation that we expect to continue to see play out in the balance of the year and going forward obviously the dta and utilization of that is an important contributor youre absolutely right the divestitures which weve started to see benefits from even in this prior quarter with the closing of the australia deal are important contributors to that as well the aoci that pulls back to par is an important factor so there are a number of factors that allow for us to build up and then as you rightfully pointed out at our investor day we talked about a strategy that over time shifts the mix of our portfolio and the mix of what contributes to our earnings profile to a more steady predictable earnings stream and that becomes an important factor as you think about what goes into the dfast analysis and establishing a more durable ppnr and therefore an improved scb over time so a number of factors build up to that the divestiture is certainly one important factor in terms of the levelingoff over time both in the way of scb but also in the way of gsib score to some extent operator thank you our next question will come from brian monteleone with vanguard your line is now open brian monteleone q analyst the vanguard group inc hey good morning mark on the earnings call when you were talking about transformation you mentioned the continued buildout of infrastructure to enhance your stress testing capabilities can you go into some more detail about kind of where you are on that the additional capabilities that will be available and kind of whats still left to do mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so look as you would imagine the transformation includes a range of investments across our operations some in finance some certainly in risk and risk management and controls et cetera et cetera and what i was referencing was around how weve been improving our stress testing capabilities really across the firm and if you take for example if you take a look at kind of counterparty credit risk and stress testing around that thats one area where weve made investments into the platform that allows for us to run multiple stress shocks against the millionplus derivative trades that we have and all of the securities financing products that we have to allow for us to see how a shock might impact the valuation or the revaluation of those exposures and positions that we have and so this the capability in the system allows for us to look at up to risk factors and to run these scenarios on a daily basis again positioning us and the entire management team to understand what the impact could be and ensure that were appropriately managing and starving off some of that risk as necessary so thats just one example of counterparty credit risk that weve and one platform tied to that that weve been investing in and as you would expect in this type of environment having those types of capabilities is critically important right and so were very pleased with that progress and know that theres more to come there citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 brian monteleone q analyst the vanguard group inc great thanks and as a followup could you give a little more detail in terms of the rwa optimization that was done in the quarter specific decisions that came out of it and then i know you guys have talked about more to do there but any kind of guide in terms of order of magnitude of whats left to do mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure and i think its important that we that i give some or remind everyone of the context for this a bit right and so when we talked about again at investor day one of the important elements of how we are managing the business is how we optimize the balance sheet and in particular in the case of markets how we optimize the risk weighted assets and that is with an eye towards how do we improve the returns of the firm over time and get to those medium term targets that we talked about of to and that involved the icg at a to and the pbwm business at a to and this rwa optimization in markets as a proxy for returns weve asked markets to look at how do you improve your revenue to rwa so we know a target that we want to get to for returns in that business weve translated that into a tool that they can use in order to ensure that were optimizing and that is a revenuetorwa metric that theyre using and theyve actually been making very good progress against that as they look across clients as they look across products and identify opportunities where that metric is lower than what the target is theyre constantly working through how do we either improve that by getting these clients to do more business with us across the franchise or how do we take a decision to exit that particular product with that particular client where there isnt an opportunity to do that in order to drive optimization so specific examples in the case of markets in equities rates commodities those are products where we saw improvement in or optimization of that rwa and it ranged from everything like requesting more collateral from clients to considering higher initial margin posting and the like as well as i mentioned in some instances deciding to trade away or somewhere else in depending on how low that metric was and the opportunity we did or did not see operator thank you our next question will come from david jiang with pgim your line is now open david jiang q analyst pgim inc hi guys just a question on the rwas again i know you called out the rwa optimization from i guess from australia sale do you have can you give a sense of what that is for all the businesses that you plan to exit in terms of whats been allocated there and i think you mentioned in the earnings call that the numerator impact from that is billion right mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so what yeah so im just there are multiple points there so one is the rwa optimization i was just speaking about was really related to markets in particular and how were kind of managing it broadly you rightfully point out that with the exits those exits contribute to us having more capital and to some extent citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 therefore helping to improve our cet1 ratio and over time affording us that capital that we can return to shareholders what i described on the earnings call was that for the deals that we have in the balance of the year and expect to close in the balance of the year or for the total for were looking at about billion in terms of that capital impact that we would expect of which australia was about roughly billion or so that we would have realized last quarter and the mix when i look at the impact of that for australia to that cet1 ratio was about so basis points six of those basis points coming from an rwa capital impact and the other six of those basis points in the case of australia coming from other items including the cta benefit that flowed through at closing so roughly a impact for australia i havent given and dont really want to break out what that mix looks like for the balance of the deals that were going to close this year but as i think youve witnessed weve been very transparent as those closings have happened and you can expect for us to continue to do that so billion for the year billion or so for australia thus far the balance comes in in the back half of for that billion david jiang q analyst pgim inc got you thanks mark the second question i have is on the funding plan the zero to billion is that mostly driven by kind of the market volatility that weve seen thus far or is there any part of that thats kind of prefunding for next year kind of pulling forward im just trying to break out what caused the additional issuance need michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure again and as weve said its up to billion so think of that range as zero to billion and its simply a reflection of giving ourselves flexibility were trying to provide some guidance around that but it could be a function of volatility it could just be a function of client needs as well as getting out in front of future issuance so this is really us just providing ourselves flexibility david jiang q analyst pgim inc got it thank you operator the next question will come from ryan butkus with lord abbett your line is now open ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett hi thanks again for the call today i was just curious there used to be a regulatory landscape update slide in the past fixed income presentations and i know a lot of the proposed rules and so forth were fully implemented but some of the materials are probably integrated within the slides now but id be curious to get your take since this is always a useful industrytype call of any particular regulatory items that are more in focus or more pending for the team that is becoming more in depth for a need to consider this year thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc ryan first of all im impressed that you recall kind of how the presentations have evolved so thank you for that look there are both things that are current and things that are on the come and ill start and mike feel free to add but id start with just kind of the broad sentiment as to how i think about capital and the regulatory environment that were managing through which is there has been this sentiment out there that theres about the right amount of capital for the industry thats out there and that was a sentiment a couple of years ago and i still subscribe to that and im hopeful that as the regulatory environment continues to evolve that that perspective is maintained and what that means is that for some of the regulation thats still out there pending that it is looked at and viewed in a holistic way so that is to say as new things are incorporated things that might exist today are reconsidered so that in aggregate the amount of capital that banks are required to hold is about the same and keep in mind that its come up over the past couple of years and so there are certainly things out there frtb and so on and so forth that are on the come in a couple of years but that is my perspective and im hopeful that that continues to be kind of a regulatory perspective around how capital is treated now we obviously just saw a pretty significant increase in the scbs across the industry thats been volatile i think that that has to be frankly looked at and considered because certainly challenging to manage with that degree of volatility in a stress capital buffer we have the gsib score that has gone up with the significant amount of liquidity thats come into the industry over the past couple of years so gsib scores for a number of banks are expected to increase theres never really been a recalibration of how we look at balance sheets and the gsib score i hope that that is considered in the context of again that holistic view so ill stop there and mike i dont know if theres anything you want to add or not but thats certainly some of my highlevel thinking on it michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc no i would just echo that its how the whole us regulatory capital framework works together and as it evolves over time i think all those measures should be contemplated whether its the basel iv gsib or even the slr how they work in unison is important ryan butkus q analyst lord abbett thank you again operator thank you our next question will come from mark kehoe with mackay shields your line is now open mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc hey good morning thank you for the call just two questions the first one maybe on rwa optimization in the markets is that optimization coming apace in the second half of the year or more a event and could it lead to kind of tightening financial conditions for some of your clients and then a followup thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so look i think optimization rwa optimization is something that we are we continually do right so its not something that is going to stop in the second half when we talked about it at investor day we talked about it in the context of a regular mining of the business if you will and looking at it through both the client and the product lens were obviously building our cet1 were in our capital building mode and so thats going to require that we look across the entire franchise to make sure that how were using the balance sheet and how were using rwa is in a way that leverages the franchise and what it has to offer to clients but also allows for us to build to that return profile that we have so i would expect that we will continue to do it in the second half of and through what it does require as it relates to clients because we are here to serve clients right but it does require that were working with those clients to ensure that they are in fact the core and strategic clients that we are best positioned to serve and what that means is that we are able to bring to bear the full breadth of our franchise as opposed to just one product and i think that is how clients get the best from us and i think that allows for us to ensure that were growing with them and generating the returns that our shareholders expect mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc great listen youve been outstanding citizens communicating your issuance needs over the last near decade just wondering now when you think like for example some on the buy side here we feel almost run over in terms of issuance this year is the way to kind of rebuild trust kind of to focus on the issuance in you mentioned billion could that number actually increase as qt takes hold and you receive more deposit outflows or should we kind of look towards and go theres less issuance in versus thank you michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc mark what i would say at this point again we try to provide some sense of guidance every year i think at this point what were trying to do is give you some sense of how we think about the back end of this year and the various things that were contemplating again as i said client needs evolving but also looking at that what we actually do beyond this year will be a function of course as we come together as a firm and build our plans for and how the balance sheet may evolve at that point too early to tell exactly what that guidance will entail at that point but as always it will be a combination of things looking at the maturities as well as what the broader needs are based on our client needs operator thank you our next question will come from jesse rosenthal with credit suisse sic creditsights your line is now open jesse your line is open please make sure your phone is not on mute jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc yeah sorry about that a quick one for me following up on the issuance in parent funding question something that weve definitely heard a lot of questions on from the fixedincome investor base but for the oneyear pref call option how do you guys think about the tradeoff between the loss in that final year and what is looking like fairly cheap funding on the reset spreads just given where rates have run and then on top of that especially in an citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 28jul2022 environment like this folding in the particular areas of business growth that youre seeing ie those nonbank lines that demand whole growth financing michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc jesse so youre right on those calls tlac is a big driver of that decision but no different than anything else that we may contemplate calling we are going to look at the overall economics as you point out what you contemplate at that point is simply a source of funding and so while you lose that some of that tlac benefit it is still a funding source and so yes we will look at the need for that funding in that part of the curve and what a replacement cost may look like and again as all things it will be a function of the interest rate component as well as the credit spread and the question of the interest rate component comes up a lot when we issue when we think in terms of the fixed interest rate we obviously have many different tools that we can utilize to manage our interest rate risk profile and its obviously the asset and liability side of the balance sheet but its also use of derivatives so sometimes that interest rate component isnt the key driver it may in fact be the spread because of some of those other tools that we utilize but youre right it does turn into a cost of funding decision once you begin to lose that tlac value jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc okay thanks for that operator thank you there are no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to peter demoise for closing remarks peter demoise analyst citigroup inc thanks everyone if you have any followup questions please reach out to ir
