reported fourth quarter revenue was billion expenses were billion and earnings per share were our performance in the quarter included the impact of million in notable items adjusting for the notable items in both periods fourth quarter revenue on a yearoveryear basis was flat with trust fees up and expenses up we focused much of our efforts in on expense control making various structural and governance changes to enable sustained longterm productivity improvements actions included disciplined head count management vendor consolidation rationalization of our real estate footprint and process automation although we brought our yearoveryear expense growth down in each quarter this year our expense growth in was still too high relative to our trust fee and revenue growth levels in recent years as such lowering the trajectory of our expense growth further remains a top priority this year as well northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 turning to the businesses our organic growth continued to be below historical levels although we saw improvement throughout the year within wealth management for the fourth quarter in the year solid growth in client advisory fees was largely offset by product level asset outflows we continued to see ongoing strength in the higher wealth tiers above million in client assets where our expertise track record and industry leadership are significant differentiators our ability to harness the data and analytics from serving the wealthiest people in the world for more than years coupled with our holistic advicedriven culture sets us apart in the marketplace and will continue to be an important driver of our success drawing from our experience working with some of the most sophisticated families around the globe next month the northern trust institute will publish its first book secrets of enterprising families the book will provide a window into what works for ultrahighnetworth families who have succeeded generation after generation and what doesnt to help other families gain important insights and unlock value the book will be launched with a series of client and prospect events around the country giving us a new channel to establish relationships and develop business finally as a testament to our exceptional client service and expertise in we were named best private bank for family offices in the us and best private bank for succession planning in the us by the financial times group asset servicing generated solid new business growth in both the fourth quarter and full year but this was largely offset by continuing asset outflows at the client level and generally lower transaction volumes and capital markets activities we performed particularly well with asset owners in the americas in the fourth quarter notable wins included the state of nebraska investment council pension plan and costcos retirement plan we were also re appointed as asset servicing provider for the healthcare of ontario pension plan throughout the year we also generated healthy momentum with asset managers in the uk and emea regions where our solutions for alternatives and private credit were particularly wellreceived weve recently finalized terms with one of the worlds largest private markets firms which will add significant scale to our alternatives division this appointment is a testament to our ability to successfully compete for some of the largest and most complex mandates our asset servicing business received numerous awards in for its innovation and industry leadership including best outsourcing provider by waters european transfer agent of the year and administrator of the year by funds europe best global custodian for asset owners by asianinvestor in asset management following several quarters of client outflows we generated positive overall inflows in the fourth quarter including healthy growth in index equity and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive liquidity inflows weve seen particularly good momentum in our highyield complex with of our taxable active funds outperforming their oneyear benchmarks our alternatives funds have also continued to generate solid growth and remain an important driver of our fee revenue as a result our product launches during the year focused largely on alternatives capabilities in closing we enter with positive momentum wellpositioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty our focus is squarely on accelerating profitable organic growth maintaining our expense discipline and driving greater resiliency and efficiency in our operating model with that ill turn it over to jason to review our financial performance jason jason j tyler executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 thank you mike let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported gaap fourth quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was as noted on the slide our reported results included a million loss on the sale of securities related to a repositioning of the portfolio that we completed in november they also included an million fdic special assessment our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up sharply on both a sequential and yearoveryear basis strong equity and fixed income markets coupled with favorable currency movements drove most of the improvement in both periods offset slightly by asset outflows in both periods given the intraperiod market movement and lag effects of our fee arrangements markets had an unfavorable impact on sequential trust fee growth and a favorable impact on yearoveryear trust fee growth on a yearoveryear basis currency movements had an approximate basis point favorable impact on revenue growth largely within our asset servicing segment and a basis point unfavorable impact on expenses on a sequential basis currency impacts were immaterial excluding notable items in all periods revenue was flat on both a sequential quarter and yearoveryear basis expenses were wellcontrolled up sequentially and up over the prior year trust investment and other servicing fees totaled billion sequential decrease and a increase compared to last year all other noninterest income on an fte basis was down sequentially and down over the prior year net interest income on an fte basis was million up sequentially and down from a year ago our provision for credit losses was million in the fourth quarter overall our credit quality remains very strong net chargeoffs during the quarter were million nonperforming loan levels decreased to million from million in the prior period and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans remained stable turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custodyadministration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend asset servicing fees totaled million custody and fund administration fees were million assets under management for asset servicing clients were trillion and asset management fees within asset servicing were million moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients were ph billion assets and trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were million moving to page and our balance sheet and net interest income trends our average balance sheet decreased on a linkedquarter basis primarily due to lower borrowing activity it declined compared to the prior year due to lower client deposits average deposits were billion essentially flat with the prior quarter and meaningfully better than our expectations we experienced a strongerthananticipated increase in deposits late in the quarter ending the year at billion at quarterend operational deposits comprised approximately twothirds of institutional deposits and institutional deposits comprised to of the total mix despite significant leverage capacity we reduced our average borrowings by billion relative to the third quarter or nearly reducing both our fhlb advances and fed funds purchased shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet billion securities repositioning we completed in november involved the sale of both highquality liquid assets and nonhighquality liquid assets availableforsale securities with a weighted average maturity of two to three years earlier this week we completed another billion repositioning which enhances our flexibility given the dynamic rate environment well record an associated loss northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 in the first quarter of approximately million the proceeds of both sales were invested in short floating rate securities further reducing the duration of the portfolio which is now years average loan balances were billion flat both sequentially and relative to the prior year our endofperiod loan balances were up billion or over the third quarter reflecting an increase in overdrafts related to higher levels of yearend trading and settlement activity our loans have since returned to billion the heightened activity at the end of the quarter did not have a material impact on net interest income in either the fourth quarter or first quarter as a reminder approximately of the loan portfolio is floating the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year our average liquidity levels remain strong cash held at the federal reserve and other central banks was down reflecting the decrease in borrowings but highquality liquid assets comprise more than of our deposits and more than of total earning assets on average our net interest income in will continue to be driven largely by client deposit behavior which has been less predictable given the unique aspects of this rate cycle we expect the november and january securities repositioning to provide an incremental million in net interest income per quarter in relative to fourth quarter levels we currently expect first quarter net interest income to be in the range of million to million this assumes deposits remain stable but deposit pricing continues to be under some pressure with further nim compression possible as long as quantitative tightening persists and the deposit environment stays highly competitive turning to page as reported noninterest expenses were billion in the fourth quarter up sequentially and up as compared to the prior year excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide expenses in the fourth quarter were up just under sequentially and under yearoveryear ill hit on just a few highlights excluding all notable items compensation expense was up yearoveryear this reflected the impact from base pay adjustments partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and head count actions taken yeartodate fulltime equivalent head count was down or sequentially and down or over the prior year excluding notable items in all periods noncompensation expense was up yearoveryear equipment and software expense was up yearoveryear largely due to increased amortization expense recall that as much as twothirds of this line item is comprised of depreciation and amortization expense and finally we realized basis points of trust fee operating leverage in the quarter turning to the full year results on page trust fees were down in largely due to asset outflows and weaker transaction volume partially offset by the elimination of ratedriven fee waivers and new business generation excluding the impact of the two securities repositionings other noninterest income was down reflecting weakness in foreign exchange trading and other capital markets activities net interest income was up over million or which largely offset the decline in the other noninterest income categories this translated to flat total revenue growth reported expenses were up for the full year to billion excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide the expenses were billion in up which compares favorably to as weve noticed previously we expect to bring the expense growth rate down further in we have clear line of sight to two key areas of increase base pay adjustments within compensation expense and depreciation and amortization increases within equipment and software northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 on a blended rate we expect to provide base pay adjustments of approximately million in which will hit our compensation line beginning in the second quarter this compares to base pay adjustments of million in within equipment and software expense we expect a million or increase in combined these two line items will drive approximately increase in operating expenses above levels alone that said we expect to continue to generate meaningful efficiency gains from our productivity office and have identified further opportunities for improvement as we look out to the first quarter we expect the following first quarter compensation expense will include our annual equity incentive payments including those for retirementeligible employees along with modest employee head count growth associated with growth in the underlying businesses this should translate to a sequential increase of million to million employee benefits expense is expected to increase by approximately million due to seasonally higher payroll taxes turning to page our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimums our common equity tier ratio under the standardized approach was flat with the prior quarter at as capital accretion offset a modest increase in riskweighted assets levels this reflects a basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements our tier leverage ratio was up basis points from the prior quarter at quarterend our unrealized pre tax loss on availableforsale securities was million we returned over million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of million and common stock repurchases of million for the full year we returned approximately million to common stockholders including common stock repurchases of approximately million and with that ruth please open the line for questions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to glenn schorr with evercore jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there good morning so i appreciate all the numbers you helped us with im going to try to peek a little bit more under the covers so deposits stable heard your thoughts on nii on the further deposit pricing pressure so the question is as we go throughout the year do you have any window into that stability in deposits sticking around and then with the combination of floating rate loan book and still pressure on deposits is it reasonable to assume that nii might go down in second quarter forward before stabilizing later in the year and rising i know thats a little bit further look into the future but indiscernible jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i think its a very reasonable way to frame looking out further into the year and i think youre right for us to say full year numbers at this point its just too early but it is good to think about how the assets and liabilities are going to react with looming rate cuts and i think its helpful to think back on how the impact in nim occurred with rates rising initially it was very different than what happened eventually when betas were much higher and i think on the way down we might have a similar situation where the first cuts may be different than the later ones and two things jump out in my mind one is weve never tried to be a pricesetter in deposits our goal has always been keep the deposits in the house and we were very aggressive at following what we saw market pricing was and the second thing is that as we get these initial cuts we could see the market reacting in a way to cheap deposit costs deposit yields for clients higher to hold on to deposits and so i think initially might be tougher than what happens eventually now all that said the volumes matter a lot and its obviously been extremely hard for us to predict where volumes were going to go and we saw october better than we anticipated november was better than october december was better than november and so volumes are going to be critical in what happens in the first half of the year and its just super hard to predict glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i definitely appreciate that this one might be a little bit easier the followup on fee operating leverage i mean just by means of pricing alone or the markets alone the markets had a strong end to the fourth quarter so your fee run rate should probably be a lot better going into the first quarter and with your comments on even more sharper discipline on expenses do you expect to make some meaningful progress early on in the year in this fee to expense ratio jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 yeah youre right to call out that theres a there is a lift the launch point higher coming into the year and i dont know if id say meaningful but its definitely higher and the lag effects will help us as we walk into the year and so thats the math of it but then more strategically we do feel positive about the pipeline in both asset servicing and in wealth management and underneath both businesses our asset management business is incredibly important and as mike mentioned in his commentary theres some early signs of flows back in and we always think just as we do on deposits just keep the money in the house keep the client assets in the house but if our asset management business does better then that helps as well and so i think the strategic component is also were feeling early signs of some positive movement from an organic perspective operator well go next to steven chubak with wolfe research jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i was hoping to maybe just unpack like the deposit discussion a bit further and specifically just get a sense as to how youre thinking through the impact of ongoing fed qt it does feel like a lot of the liquidity in the system has come out of rrp thats provided a bit of stability or at least has helped drive better deposit resiliency over the last six months but with the rrp expected to be exhausted over the next call it three to four months just want to get a sense once that happens how you expect deposit flows to ultimately trend jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah ill start and mike may have thoughts too because we talk about this a lot and its more predictive than it is quantitatively spitting out results frankly but youre right that my sense is that the rrp program had a really significant impact on deposits and it was effectively competing with banks for deposits and now that its come down i do think that thats been a help now from here is different and i think we have to think about the fact that rate movements are going to also have an impact on how clients think about deposits and with the deposit costs having gone up so much in the second half of the year and again that was that had a big impact on deposit costs and client behavior we could see that having an impact this year as rates come down and so i think its not just the rrp program but how clients think about instead of rates how they think about rates and comparing that to maybe more of a riskon trade and so i think weve got to think both about the program and the rate environment michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah and i would agree with what jason said there and just as there was a transition on the way up with qe theres going to be a transition on the way down unchartered territory for everyone on qt and how they go about that and when they might stop more aggressively seeing their portfolio come down so i think the timing of that will matter and then also we saw with client behavior that as rates went up more of the liquidity moved into treasuries and that had an impact on us and as we come down i think over time a lot of the funds that have moved into treasuries will start to move into other alternatives and as jason said our objective is to work with the clients and really try to meet any of those needs and keep the dollars in the house northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and just for my followup the duration on the asset side of the balance sheet admittedly has been a little bit more volatile especially given some of the repositioning actions you talked about the asset betas with rate hikes were quite elevated for you guys and some of your trust peers as well just wanted to get a sense as to what percentage of the asset side of the balance sheet if we took a snapshot today is sensitive to movement in short rates as we do prepare for eventual rate cuts jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp were going to do it in three buckets and if you just take cash obviously of that the second loans and roughly threequarters are ratesensitive and you think about the securities portfolio and ill give you two numbers to play with one is the duration is meaningful at now about years but also just the weighted average maturity of the portfolio i think is also helpful which is a little under years and we quote this the duration of the balance sheet thats just us doing a weighted average across those effectively just to give a sense of the impact of the large size of the cash component and the large floating component of the loan book steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and jason could we just clarify what percentage of the securities book today is floating jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its about a third of the book is floating is floating operator well go next to alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey jason hey mike good morning everybody just building on stevens questions for a second i guess given the fact that rates are expected to come down and you guys have actually been i guess shifting the balance sheet to be maybe a little bit more floating for the right reason and obviously been a good trait for nii for last quarter this quarter any expectations to actually start locking in higher yields going forward and maybe extending duration a little bit i know this is pretty quick you guys have just kind of gone the other way but the balance sheet effectively became a little more floating as rates are about to come down so just curious how youre thinking about that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its on our mind a lot and as were talking about it and we have brought the duration down and one of the benefits to that is that it does make us just a lot more flexible because the markets have been really dynamic northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 and so there will come a time when i i anticipate where we would say its time to step out a little bit our bias over the last year has obviously been to go shorter and thats played out i think rates have the way rates have played out we had a view and not materially but it worked in our favor but from here i think we do have to think about its not locking in as much as just taking the downside risk off the table of a dramatic reduction in rates and so theres some component there that wed say we can naturally hedge against alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you makes sense i wanted to follow up for my second one just around the expense outlook was super noisy there is a bunch of onetimers obviously so i just want to clarify a couple of things jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc so i guess the ultimate message is that expense growth expected to be lower than i think the core expense growth in was about so i just want to confirm that and then the core base youre speaking to is it still kind of billion to maybe billion in sort of core expense base off of which we should think about jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so confirm that the number we think of is just a little bit less than that right at about and the we are working from a base in of billion and probably worthwhile to invest a minute and just explain because youre right there have been a few things so if you walk the reported billion and then you take out in the year severancerelated charges with two occupancy charges that totaled about million there was a client capability writeoff we mentioned in second quarter million fdic special assessment million and then there was a small equipment credit of million in the third quarter that we mentioned as well and the severancerelated charge in q2 was million just to make sure i give you the numbers on everything and so lets work that tells us wed work from a base of billion operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question would love to follow up on that last question actually so thanks for clarifying the base thats helpful you number one just to confirm you did mention that i think it would be inclusive of adjusting for the writeoff of the client capability just want to confirm that and just to clarify the message on the investing super clear that youre working to drive expense growth lower than you saw in northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 but you also laid out an uplift of from base pay and software so does that represent like a floor to growth or do you have sufficient levers to offset at least some of that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp its not a floor but it does give you a sense of whats already in the base from which were working and so weve got to use productivity to get aggressively at that some of our productivity work is already reflected in that but weve got to do more this year and we wanted to be super transparent in the things that we already know that are in the increase so that you guys can predict what that level is brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay and is the writeoff of the capability that was in other operating expense part of the adjustments too sorry if i missed that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes operator our next question comes from the line of mike brown with kbw jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey mike michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey great good morning thanks for taking my questions the sequential increase in the noninterestbearing deposits that was a positive to see this quarter could you just touch on maybe some of the key drivers there was this supported by some of the new business activity that you referenced in the prepared remarks and then i appreciate the comments on the deposits and the potential for the stability here nearterm but i guess focusing on the nibs can they stabilize at this level either in terms of like an absolute dollar basis or as a percentage of the total deposits jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp my observation looking at it is that its less percentagedriven and more what is that base and the reason i mention it that way is a lot of that nib it comes from one of the channels in our institutional business and it actually performed better than the rest of the institutional business in looking at it over the last few weeks and so it just tells me that that client that subclient channel behaves on its own and it looks like that has flattened out somewhat not necessarily calling it a plateau at this point but it certainly behaved a little bit better than the rest of the institutional book and another component is the wealth book which that deposit base increased in the quarter it was not dramatically but it was nice to see that up on average and obviously we saw overall the whole deposit book very flat but nice to see that the wealth book doing well because even though the noninterestbearing is northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 obviously highly attractive economically the wealth deposits are very attractive as well not at zero but theyre very attractive and that component did well on the quarter michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for those thoughts jason jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i guess on the servicing side of the business i was hoping you could maybe just touch on the competitive landscape in the alternative asset side of the business how do you think about maybe that opportunity for northern trust and how are your if you could just talk about your capabilities today and maybe where youre investing to take some share in that space michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah mike so ill address that we believe that the alternative space or broadly speaking just private markets is a major opportunity for us on the asset servicing side and that largely follows with whats happening in the marketplace from an investor perspective and so we expect that market to grow and we think we have the value proposition that is compelling within that you heard in my comments earlier that weve recently won a very large mandate with one of the large private markets firms and it was after an exhaustive process that we went through to win that business very capabilities oriented very global as to the capabilities necessary and the footprint necessary to do it so again its an area of focus for us and one where we think were going to be able to continue to grow as the market grows and as were able to take share michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks mike appreciate the commentary there michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator well go next to ryan kenny with morgan stanley jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning ryan northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i have a question on capital so your cet1 ratio is well above the regulatory minimum well above last years level and then we got the comment letter from basel endgame a couple of days ago and theres clearly a lot of industry pushback there your earnings generation from nii looked a little bit higher than consensus expected so putting that all together how should we think about how northern is approaching buybacks this year and this quarter is there any room to maybe lean in a little bit there jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so youre right in the teeup of the numbers theres obviously room we did a fair amount of buybacks in the quarter a little bit more than we do on average and were always looking at that relative to other opportunities we have to invest capital and so in the nearterm were thinking about does it make more sense to invest in rwa effectively to say we could grow the loan book more or we could do more in fx we could do more in sec lending or do we want to reposition the take a different repositioning in the securities portfolio the repositionings we did this year were all helpful to capital because in going shorter we and out of nonhqla into hqla on that those were all helpful to capital but you also know how closely we look at peers and we take pride in the capital levels we have we think its part of our financial model and our business model and talking to clients and being able to evidence to them how strong the capital base is and so theres definitely room but we also got to have in mind that basel endgame which youve referenced briefly its still unclear and we did do a comment letter which you referenced but its unclear what the impacts are going to be we think were in good position relative to peers but want to keep an eye on that but well also think about additional stock repurchases as we always do given alternatives we have ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and can you also update us on your expectations regarding ability and timing to dispose of the class b visa shares and would that potentially have any impact on capital and buybacks outlook jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so just for people who dont follow this closely we own just over million visa b shares and at the current exchange rate show that translates to about billion and theres a proposal that is going to be voted on next week i think that would enable the b shareholders to monetize half of the holdings so what are we planning to do one at this point theres nothing to do the proposal is still outstanding and weve got to wait and see what the shareholder vote looks like even assuming it passes there are timing restrictions to it but that said this is not a strategic asset for northern trust and so you should read into that its not something that were saying were going to hold on to beyond what the restrictions would enable us to do and were discussing all the options theres likely going to be a combination of a few tools that well take but early to give details on that at this point operator well go next to brian bedell with deutsche bank northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks hey good morning if i could just clarify jason a couple of things you gave guidance on earlier just to make sure i heard it right the incremental nii from the two portfolio securities sales is million annualized and that comparison period is versus is that correct jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so you broke up a tiny bit but i think im following where you are but dont hesitate to tell me if i missed it so the november repositioning helped in the quarter by call it million and but that should be helpful going forward to the tune of in the neighborhood of million a quarter the january repositioning which we mentioned for the first time a little while ago that should help in the quarter about round numbers about million a quarter brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc million per quarter okay and then on the expense side maybe just if we can try to get some more clarity on the total expense growth i think you said comp expense being up million to million in versus because of the retirementeligible options and then employee benefits up million versus so correct me if im wrong on that and then just translating that into expense growth through the year obviously theres lots of different levers but is the idea to try to improve on the expense contribution from that from a total growth perspective or should we be thinking of expense growth say better than lower than but potentially higher than and can you improve that trust expense to trust fee ratio in from jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah yeah so couple of things one confirm your numbers are right on first quarter and the stepup remember both of those are fully seasonal brian so the stepup in first quarter is just because thats what thats the booking of our retirementeligible equity grants and so that in and of itself represents the vast majority of that stepup and then similarly the weve got a higher payroll tax in first quarter just as we hit the caps on that level but both of those numbers come back down for second third fourth quarter that said second quarter we got to build in the base pay adjustments that we referenced which was that million thatll be second third fourth quarter so all that said the goal is to do better than the roughly we did this year the was not seen as again back to it its not seen as a floor but also its thats a big difference to go from down to and so were using the productivity to do everything we can to get materially better than the but the fact that were walking in with already in the base is just going to make it difficult and so i think its and the last thing ill mention is for us were anticipating organic growth thats our we target we have organic growth targets for each of the three businesses and we want to continue to be a growth company that is important and that drives some expenses in addition to expectation of what were doing from a revenue perspective and so its hard to finetune much with to say is it between and if were not doing northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 as well from an organic perspective were going to be working really hard to say what else do we do to make sure were doing the right thing and we get positive fee operating leverage operator well go next to jim mitchell with seaport global jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning hey good morning maybe just to follow up on that last comment just maybe a little more detail it seems like organic growth in it was a tough environment a little mixed so it seems like youre more optimistic across the board so if you can kind of just give us a little more thought detail on the organic growth prospects this year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure jim its mike ill start off here so youre absolutely right weve gone through i would say a time period where the organic growth has definitely been strained and lower than our historical levels and theres a number of factors behind that that weve talked about over the preceding earnings calls that relate to client activity that relate to some of the outflows that we had in the asset management business which obviously impacts then wealth management and asset servicing and the reason why were so positive going forward here on organic growth some of those trends as we talked about have turned around and so we see good inflows into asset management so that aspect of it is a lift going forward to our organic growth but then also the strategies that we have in place to drive profitable organic growth where weve been focused as a company is in a couple of areas or a few areas one is really looking at the portfolio of our growth so historically asset servicing has been the majority of the organic growth and looking forward were looking to shift that more towards the more scalable parts of our business so wealth management and asset management that doesnt mean that the asset servicing business will not be growing its just were very focused within that business to the areas that scale the most so if you think about the nature of all the things we do for clients on that front some of those activities are more scalable more profitable than others and so well lean towards those areas i mentioned the success weve had with asset owners in the americas a lot of that is that custody and related services on that front thats some of the more scalable services that we have and its again not to say that we wont be doing the business with the asset managers so fund services but some of those areas are more resourceintensive and so were going to be really disciplined about the types of business that we take in that require hiring more people investing more in particular technologies around that and then the last thing i would say just around the organic growth and why were optimistic on it is the businesses are working i would say much more closely together in how we go to market so as we would call it here one northern trust is our approach to the marketplace so its not separate businesses but rather to the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 extent that were going to approach a client or a prospect to work with them its going to include multiple offerings from across the businesses particularly asset management with asset servicing on the frontend as part of a bundle that were offering to the clients and then certainly with wealth management as well you heard in some of our earlier comments here the advisory fee component of wealth management has been growing nicely through the year we think that it can grow at a higher rate but importantly the more that we can do on the product side with those clients as well so as we talk about the transitioning with quantitative tightening for example and the move out of shortterm treasuries to the extent that we can help those clients move into fixed income funds for example thats a real opportunity for us so a number of things that were doing to proactively try to drive that organic growth jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thats really great color mike and maybe just a quick followup on deposit pricing jason you talked about still some pressure on overall deposit costs is that lag still on pricing or is that an assumption of a negative mix shift out of nibs whats kind of driving further pricing pressure in deposits jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its lags and we actually in fourth quarter made some agreements on pricing that will come into play in first quarter more than they did in fourth quarter and it didnt drive deposit volumes higher in fourth quarter but it is something that as we try to do more finetune predictions of what first quarter would look like its something that we factored in we think the cost could be cost will be higher and thats part of the reason why even though we ended at million and i indicated that december was better than november and october we think were still going to be flat to down a little bit in first quarter largely because of that pricing element and in general we do our view is that as the fed does reduce rates were going to have client conversations about it and again were not a pricesetter but highly committed to making sure our clients leave their deposits here operator well go next to robert wildhack with autonomous research jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys one more question on expenses im curious how you would approach a hypothetical year where revenue growth comes in a lot better than expected and what that might mean for expense growth i guess the core question is what takes precedent your expense to fee ratio or the absolute level of expense growth this year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp ill start and mike may want to add to it historically wed say we want to grow and but we have talked about ensuring that we were committed to more of an absolute number in terms of the expenses and weve also committed to more scalable growth and so were already having conversations internally about ensuring that northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 were highly disciplined on bringing on business that is scalable and so i think that that is a change relative to how weve thought about it before where there was more of a desire to bring on business at always at attractive margin but our commitment to scalable growth is going to be is higher at this point and that means that the expenses shouldnt be as volatile with anticipation or even line of sight on new business coming on that brings with it a high degree of expense yeah michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp so i agree with what jason said there just to add to your point were outside of our range on expense to trust fee ratio so were trying to drive that into the range and so as jasons indicating were leaning towards trying to get into that range sooner rather than later robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks and then on nii i would just love to get your thoughts on the sensitivity there as it relates to different scenarios from the fed whats the impact of say one or two fed cuts this year as opposed to say six fed cuts jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah those are the scenarios were looking at but i come back to this theme its just going to depend on how well were able to hang on to spread and we and theyre just been highly variable and i think our ability to predict just over the last couple of quarters has been really hard but i feel really good about the volumes that stayed in place and so i think our approach has worked but it makes its going to make it less predictable its the opposite of what we just talked about on the expense side ironically where were saying we want to be more predictable on the expenses to try and get that expense to trust fee ratio where we want it to be on the deposit side theres more flexibility and more willingness to follow where the market goes to make sure were holding on to client assets operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning mike robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning hey good morning this is rob rutschow for mike just wanted to follow up on the custody commentary a little bit more as we calculated your fees to assets under custody were down about yearover year you mentioned client outflows so how much of that is kind of riskoff versus actual pricing pressure what was the new business this year and whats the outlook for pricing pressure versus new business as we look into michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 yeah ill start and then jason you can fill it out but first of all i just think you need to take into account that we are compensated sometimes on the asset level sometimes on the transaction levels and transaction volumes were lower during the year so that drove some of the weakness in the custody fees there from a pricing perspective i would say nothing in particular as far as the competitive environment that is driving custody pricing to much lower levels if you will i would say its relatively stable on the pricing front there jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and as i look at just the underlying details of how we did i think youre leaning more toward the asset servicing business the net new business for the year was it was positive and year over im just thinking yearoveryear for the quarter and asset servicing hit its mark on net new business the issue with the company is some of the other things happening as we get into transactions and then what we referenced earlier in our clients going through their asset levels declining but much less of a repricing story relative to prior years and the business is winning if we just look at their win rate in the market it is strong so a lot of this year the impact came from these other dynamics of lower transaction volumes and same number of clients but less assets robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and if i could follow up on wealth i guess can you talk about the competitive dynamic there and especially in global family office you saw a little bit of deceleration in the growth rate any changes or any areas that youre looking to grow either inside the us or out jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah youre right to call it gfo had a lower much lower growth rate than it has over the last couple of years its been the last couple of years have been excellent for that business and this year was weaker but we always talk about the fact that is the spikiest business that we have very small number of client activity can lead to meaningful change and its also one of the businesses where with what happens underneath from an investment management perspective can have a meaningful impact on how the business is doing so but weve actually invested heavily in that business theyve got a lot of accomplishments in technology and some of the things that they have done with their wealth passport their overall technology platform we feel is industryleading it is industryleading just the way that theyre now interacting with clients from that platform perspective what clients are able to do with multiple accounts and reporting and client asset movement all coming and a lot of and its all cloudenabled is what weve done recently and so its highly marketleading from our view in terms what were doing and were continuing to invest in that business from a technology perspective so theres more coming which makes us feel very optimistic about what that business is going to do over the next couple of years operator this does conclude the questionandanswer
