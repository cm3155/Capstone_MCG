chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks kristin and good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today we continue to execute well through a challenging environment our focus has been on playing strong defense and maintaining a strong balance sheet during the quarter we grew our cet1 ratio to near the top of peers while still buying in million in stock with noncore loan runoff of billion and deposit growth of million in the quarter we lowered our spot loantodeposit ratio to at quarter end we focused on building up our liquidity even further given geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory direction of travel adding almost billion to cash and securities we also built our acl further to well above our pro forma day one cecl reserve of with our general office reserve now at while the balance sheet has been a principal focus we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives which should drive strong mediumterm performance our private bank is being built out we had a soft launch during the back half of q3 and we brought in around million in deposits and investments full launch is scheduled over the next several weeks were executing well on our new york city metro push our deposit strategies our top programs our esg initiatives and our payments strategy our underlying eps for the quarter missed the mark slightly at as several capital markets deals slipped from q3 to q4 given linked quarter market volatility this was the weakest capital markets quarter since the third quarter of three years ago and prior to several acquisitions like jmp and dh capital the good news here is that the pipelines remain strong and we continue to maintain and grow our market share nii expenses and credit costs all track to expectations we included what we hope is an informative and useful slide in the deck page which breaks out results for our legacy core business our private bank startup investment and the drag from noncore note the legacy core performance shows q3 eps of nim of and rotce of the private bank should turn positive by mid2024 and be nicely accretive in and noncore will dramatically run down over the next several quarters this dynamic will help offset the drag from forwardstarting swaps and help propel results higher over time citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 given the continued macro uncertainty and pressure on revenue from higher rates weve initiated a zerobased review of expenses in an effort to keep expenses flat in well report further on this on our january call when we give guidance for q4 we expect to see key trends begin to stabilize nii will decline but by less than in the past two quarters fees should bounce back somewhat though the extent is marketdependent expenses and credit costs should be stable and we should buy in a modest amount of stock given continued solid earnings and loan runoff this has clearly been a challenging year for regional banks like citizens rest assured we are working hard were navigating the current turbulence well and were taking the actions to position us well for the medium term and with that let me turn it over to john to take you through more of the financial details john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone let me start with the headlines for the third quarter referencing slides and for the third quarter we generated underlying net income of million and eps of this includes the private bank startup investment of and a negative impact from the noncore portfolio our underlying rotce for the quarter is on slide youll see that weve provided a schedule separating out our noncore runoff portfolio and the start up investment in our new private bank from our legacy core results so you can see how those impact our performance our legacy core bank delivered a solid underwriting rotce of currently the private bank startup investment is a drag to results but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive eps benefit in similarly while noncore is currently a sizable drag to revenues it will run off quickly further bolstering our overall performance and partially mitigating the expected impact of forwardstarting swaps back to slide total net interest income was down linked quarter and our margin was down basis points both in line with expectations deposits were up slightly in the quarter reflecting the ongoing resilience of the franchise we continued our balance sheet optimization efforts further strengthening liquidity during the quarter given the uncertain geopolitical environment and in preparation for potential changes to liquidity regulations increasing cash and securities by about billion in addition the noncore portfolio declined by billion and in the quarter at billion indiscernible clarity on new liquidity rules for category iv banks it is worth pointing out that we currently exceed the current lcr requirements for both category i and category iii banks our periodend ldr improved to while our credit metrics remained solid with net chargeoffs of basis points stable linked quarter we recorded a provision for credit losses of million and a reserve build of million this quarter increasing our acl coverage to up from at the end of the second quarter with the increase primarily directed to raising the general office portfolio reserves from in to at the end of citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 we repurchased million of common shares in the third quarter and delivered a strong cet1 ratio of up from in the second quarter and our tangible book value per share decreased linked quarter reflecting aoci impacts associated with higher rates turning to slide on net interest income linked quarter results were down as expected primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin which was down basis points to as you can see from the walk at the bottom of the slide the decrease in margin was driven by deposit repricing which includes mix shift from lower cost to higher interestbearing categories noninterest bearing deposit migration as well as the mixed impact of the liquidity build i mentioned earlier these factors were mitigated by positive impacts from asset repricing and rundown of the noncore portfolio our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta is through which has been rising in response to the rate cycle and competitive environment our deposit franchise has performed well with deposit betas generally in the pack with peers this is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers our sensitivity to rising rates at the end of the third quarter is roughly neutral down slightly versus the prior quarter moving to sliding fees were down linked quarter driven primarily by lower capital markets and card fees partly offset by the increase in mortgage banking fees the capital markets fees outlook was positive early in september but with market volatility and higher long rates picking up to the end of the month we saw a number of ma deals pushed into the fourth quarter resulting in lower linked quarter ma advisory fees as well as lower bond underwriting while we continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines uncertainty continues around the timing of these deals closing given the level of market volatility card fees were slightly lower reflecting lower balance transfer fees the increase in mortgage banking fees was driven by higher msr valuation the servicing pl provides a diversifying benefit which in the quarter more than offset the decline in production as higher mortgage rates weighed on lock volumes on slide we did well on expenses keeping them broadly stable linked quarter excluding the million private bank startup investment on slide average loans are down and periodend loans are down linked quarter the noncore portfolio runoff of billion drove the overall decline partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity average core loans are down largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment periodend core loans are sustainable average commercial line utilization was down slightly this quarter as clients look to deleverage given the environment and higher rates we saw less ma financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment next to slides and we continue to do well on deposits periodend deposits were up million linked quarter with growth led by commercial and consumer deposits broadly stable our interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points which translates to a cumulative beta our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels and with of our deposits in consumer citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 and about insuredsecured this has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in this rising rate environment as rates rose in the third quarter we saw continued migration of lower cost deposits to higher yielding categories with noninterest bearing now representing about of total deposits this is back to prepandemic levels and we would expect the decline to moderate from here although this will be dependent upon the path of rates and consumer behavior now moving to credit on slide net chargeoffs were basis points stable linked quarter with a decrease in commercial offset by a slight increase in retail driven by auto which normalized following a very low second quarter result nonaccrual loans increased linked quarter to basis points of total loans reflecting an increase in general office we feel the rate of increase in nonaccruals is decelerating after a jump in q2 turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a basispoint increase from the second quarter which reflects a reserve build of million as well as the denominator effect from the rundown of the noncore portfolio we increased our general office coverage to from in the second quarter you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than weve seen in historical downturns as mentioned we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to million this quarter which represents coverage of against the billion portfolio we have already taken million in chargeoffs in this portfolio which is about of loans in setting the general office reserve we are factoring in a very severe peaktotrough decline in office values of about with the remaining to default rate and a loss severity of about so we feel the current coverage of is very strong its worth noting that the financial impact of further deterioration beyond our outlook would be manageable given our strong reserve and capital position we have a very experienced cre team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loanbyloan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrowerspecific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses i should also note that about of cre general office is in current pay status moving to slide we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio increased to as we look to grow capital given the dynamic macro environment and new capital rules proposed by the bank regulators weve returned a total of million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we plan to maintain strong and growing capital and liquidity to levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks with our size turning to slide and ill update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank so that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 first on slide weve included just a few of the business initiatives we are pursuing to drive improving performance over the medium term on the commercial side we highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital although deal activity has been relatively muted recently many sponsors have meaningful amounts of capital to deploy so there is a tremendous amount of pentup demand for ma and capital markets activity given the right market conditions we have been serving the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last years and weve established ourselves at the top of the middle market sponsor league tables and our new private bankers will significantly expand our sponsor relationships and we stand ready to leverage our capabilities in this space when sponsor activity picks up we also think there is a tremendous opportunity in the payments space and weve been investing in our treasury solutions business developing integrated payments platforms and expanding our client hedging capabilities on the consumer side our entry into new york metro is going very well with some early success attracting new customers to the bank and growing deposits about nine times faster than in our legacy branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network the buildout of the private bank is also going very well these bankers have hit the ground running and have already brought in around million in deposits and investment balances through a soft launch in the back half of q3 this is a coasttocoast team with a presence in some of our key markets like new york boston and places where wed like to do more like florida and california we plan to open a few private banking centers in these geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with our clarfeld legacy wealth business as the centerpiece of that effort turning to slide on the top left side is our balance sheet optimization program which is progressing well the chart illustrates the relatively rapid rundown of the noncore portfolio which is comprised of our billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans this portfolio is expected to decline by about billion from where we are now to about billion at the end of and as this runs down we plan to redeploy the majority of cash pay downs to building core bank liquidity with the remainder used to support organic relationshipbased loan growth in the core portfolio the capital recaptured through reduction in noncore rwa will be reallocated to support the growth of the private bank in summary this strategy strengthens liquidity and has already been a source of about billion of term funding abs issuance this year it builds capital by reducing rwas and its accretive to nim eps and rotce next to our top program on the right side of the slide our latest program is well underway and on target to deliver a million pretax run rate benefit by yearend our top programs are essential to improving our returns over the medium term and we are ready to launch on top looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of ai to better serve our customers citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 we are looking at ways to simplify our organization and save more in thirdparty spend as well in light of pressure on revenue given the rate environment we are targeting to keep underlying expenses flat on the technology front we have a very extensive agenda with a multiyear nextgen tech cloud migration targeting the exit of all of our data centers by and a program to converge our core deposit system onto a cloudbased modern banking platform weve come a long way modernizing our platforms since the ipo and on the esg front we recently announced a billion sustainable finance target which we plan to achieve by and commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by and we are working diligently to help our clients prepare for and finance their own transitions to a lower carbon economy moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter on slide our outlook incorporates the private bank and assumes that the fed hold rates steady through the end of the year we expect nii to be down approximately next quarter given the impact from noninterest bearing and lowcost deposits migrating to higher cost categories albeit at a decelerating rate more than offsetting the benefit of higher asset yields noncore runoff and day count based on the forward curve we expect the cumulative deposit beta at the end of to be approximately and to rise to a terminal level of low percent before the first rate cut noninterest income is expected to be up to with a seasonal pickup in capital markets depending upon on the market environment noninterest expense should be broadly stable which includes the private bank and excludes the anticipated fdic special assessment net chargeoffs are expected to rise to approximately mid basis points as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expected further normalization we feel good about our reserve coverage around the current level and the acl level will continue to benefit from loan runoff our cet1 is expected to increase to approximately with the opportunity to engage in a modest level of share repurchases the execution of which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment beyond the guidance as i mentioned earlier we are targeting flat underlying expenses this includes the private bank and the noncore portfolio and excludes the anticipated fdic special assessment also weve included slide in the appendix on the swaps impact through we expect higher swap expense in to be partly offset by the benefit to nii from the noncore rundown notably the swap expense drag will reduce meaningfully over through as swaps run off and the fed normalizes short rates in addition the impact of terminated swaps is dramatically lower in and to wrap up we delivered solid results this quarter while navigating through a dynamic environment importantly we made good progress positioning the company with a strong capital liquidity and funding position which will serve us well as regulatory requirements are finalized and if the environment becomes more challenging our balance sheet strength also positions us to take advantage of opportunities through our strategic priorities as we continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive riskadjusted returns citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john greg why dont we open it up for some qa question and answer section operator okay operator instructions your first question comes from the line of erika najarian from ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is for john john there has been a lot of feedback from investors on uncertainty over the nii trajectory for in the environment of higher for longer and i think you know where im going here i think that investors are trying to sort of square the billion billion increase in notional swaps right at a received fixed rate of in the second half of next year and trying to square that in a higher for longer environment with some of the balance sheet optimization so if you could just sort of take us through a little bit of the moving pieces and perhaps simplify it for the investors listening in terms of how that impacts your nii trough timing what happens after you hit trough and are you still confident in what you said i guess a month ago in that you could exit with a nim john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks erika maybe ill take that a little bit in reverse order because it might help us with the jump off conversation so net interest margin came in as expected in the third quarter so we felt good about that at i think that the two big forces that i would talk about broadly as you look out into the fourth quarter would be our basic ongoing deposit migration and how that is expected to play out so id say that if you look at overall net interest margin id say that were going to see another call it midsingle digit sort of headwind into the fourth quarter just on the entire balance sheet outside of liquidity build and so that kind of comes in right around that so thats kind of playing out the way we expect it notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing ongoing migration id say that thats holding about where we think it should be citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 the other item as you may have seen in some of our walks in the slide deck is the fact that given the uncertainty and regulatory environment weve endeavored to actually build liquidity in a much more meaningful way that liquidity build is niineutral but it does have a nominal impact to the net interest margin and so you could see that being an impact in the fourth quarter of it was a couple maybe basis points or so in the third quarter that could be maybe another call it several basis points as you get into fourth quarter so you can see things playing out as we expect in the fourth quarter when you basically get to the dynamics once you reset the table in the fourth quarter the big puts and takes are we do have the swap portfolio increasing as you get into its flattish when you get into the first half of the year but it rises in the second half of the year it happens that as it relates to thats about when the forward curve would start implying that cuts are starting to come in so id say that when you think about some of the mitigants to the outlook with the swap portfolio youre going to have potentially the fed beginning to cut in the second half of you have the ongoing benefit of the noncore portfolio youve got the growing accretive contributions from the private bank and with long rates being where they are asset front book back book is a kind of will contribute positively and then just the broader balance sheet optimization efforts that were doing across the bank i think are all the areas that i would highlight as nice mitigants to what were seeing play out and lets see where the rate environment plays out i mean the forwards have it in one place we have economic bloomberg economist consensus are probably basis points lower than where the forwards are but i mean nevertheless we see this potentially playing out to a very manageable and frankly growing momentum as you exit on the net interest margin erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and just to clarify are you still confident that you could exit taking all that into account exit have a nim of about and based on sort of what youre telling us it sounds like if the fed doesnt cut as the forward curve indicated that would be the risk to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think in the fourth quarter id say that all else equal were getting around that level depending upon the impact of liquidity builds which are niineutral and as i said liquidity build piece that i would say which is kind of i would say sort of set that aside just given where we are it doesnt drive nii so when youre thinking about the net interest margin that drives nii were going to be in that neighborhood of exliquidity build erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and im going to step back after this because i think im taking up too much time i just want to clarify im asking about are you talking about for i just wanted to make sure were on the same page john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sorry i needed to make sure that was clear everything i was just saying was about in that last bit was that were getting around that level give or take in exliquidity build and the liquidity build is niineutral so if youre trying to think about where were driving nii its around that plus or minus level ex citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 liquidity build for and all the other forces that we talked about earlier where were as youre going into when i was ticking off that the tailwinds from noncore private bank asset front book back book and bso all of those are tailwinds into which will be mitigants along with lets see where the rate cuts actually start kicking in in the second half of and well see where we exit but thats something well come back to you on in terms of adding more color in january as we typically do and well assess our environment and all of those forces and puts and takes at that time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thank you for taking the question i guess i want to revisit that fourth quarter margin just to make sure everybodys on the same page but the reported margin it sounds like will be below the however right because you do and i know it will be dependent on liquidity build but it sounds like you do anticipate liquidity build so well be talking kind of something in the mid2 would that be sort of the reported expectation john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island it will be lower it just depends on the niineutral liquidity build that we determined to be appropriate so its sort of i think its useful to talk about it exliquidity build given the fact that thats the driver of nii and therell be possibly additional just in terms of the variability of cash and how that gets funded itll be thats flat to nii but it will be a denominator effect that would take the nim below that plus or minus that i talked about before but not an nii driver r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay all right perfect and then maybe as we look out just in terms of sort of the handoff from the non core loan runoff to more visible private bank growth when do we sort of think that will become sort of more neutral from in terms of visibility to the balance sheet like when would we expect the loan portfolio to sort of level out john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think that we were saying that we think that the noncore runoff will be a continued driver of sort of in the first half of in and the first half of youll see some declines in the loan portfolio but in the second half of we start seeing the private bank contributing as well as organic contribution and starting to see loan growth such that yearoveryear we would have an expectation youd see us starting to see loan growth in the second half of citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter from da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thank you just i was wondering on the credit side weve just seen in general some preannouncements on chargeoffs in the shared national credit space can you just remind us what your exposure is to share of national credits and how you fared in the recent exam bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so let me take that john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so just in general as i think of theres a lot of focus on shared national credits actually when we came through the exam this year we had more upgrades than we had downgrades so we didnt have any forced chargeoffs in terms of our the shared national credit book weve been taking our participations down as part of our bso exercise were there about lower than they were a couple of quarters ago i think theres a lot of focus on shared national credit we treat participations or shared national credit deals exactly as we treat every other credit extension so one it has to return people think about it as hanging paper and then deploying loans and not returning we go through the exact same process whether were participating or leaving a transaction or a sole lender and then also we do full credit analysis of every single extension that we make whether it be a shared national credit extension or not so our snc book doesnt perform any worse than any other book that we have in the bank and actually in some cases its larger credits so they might perform marginally better than some of the middlemarket assets that we have on the book over time brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i think just as part of the bso as bruce said as part of bso in general were kind of looking at the total relationship returns and if we went into a credit as a participant thinking we can kind of move left and become more important bank thats not panning out were not getting the crosssell we anticipated and were extricating ourselves at the next available opportunity so i think youll continue to see that trend citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me just pick up on that just in the last quarter back to the loan growth question we had about million of front book loan originations offset by about billion of bso activity so were really churning the book towards full relationship credits and away from some of those participations that bruce mentioned and i think a lot of the competition is doing exactly the same thing we see people supporting their lead bank relationships and moving away from more speculative future opportunities peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thank you and then just can you just provide a little bit more color maybe on the deposit repricing and migration and how you see it playing out with a longer higher for longer rates just impacting the deposit pricing pressures john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and handle that i mean i think first off i mean i think when you look at our performance from a deposit beta standpoint we feel like were basically in the pack with what youre seeing across the industry which is a really positive result compared to where we were last cycle its just part of the ongoing investments weve been making in primacy and product capabilities and delivering the entire banks for our customers so were really kind of pleased to see where were how things are playing out cycle to date that said we still are and frankly you look at the overall metric of noninterest bearing to overall deposits were around thats basically back to where we were prepandemic weve seen a decelerating migration out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing and seeing decelerating migration even inside of the interestbearing book nevertheless its getting smaller every quarter we would expect to see that really dissipating over the coming quarter or two and thats really what you see when you get late in the cycle and the feds on hold so feeling very good about that trajectory bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe brendan you track very carefully how were doing versus peers and some of our strategy is to continue to maintain that lowcost focus so maybe you could add some additional color brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sounds good so much of our lowcost deposit book is in the consumer space and obviously was buoyed through the pandemic by all the stimulus we saw the rundown of the stimulus rate peak in may and it started to abate as we got into the summer and the fall although its still kind of spending down at a decent clip we do have a lot of analytics benchmarking analytics and how were doing and this is supportive of johns commentary that the franchise is performing at a very different level than it did the last upgrade cycle we believe were number two in the peer set in terms of dda consumer migration so were performing exceptionally well on the dda side citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 when you look at beta on the consumer side as compared with the growth that were getting it appears were about to basis points better in net growth on the consumer book through the cycle so far and our betas are mildly better so more growth slightly better cost on the core book thats excluding citizens access thats a real indicator of the quality of the franchise and the quality of the customer base that weve moved from sort of a community banking highpriced deposit focus to deeply engaged primary banking relationships so we expect the paydown of lowcost deposits to continue to slow obviously depending on rate environment and the economy that potentially could change but i do feel really confident in is that our relative performance to peers will be strong and well continue to outperform on the consumer side on the stability of our lowcost book at the individual customer level they still have a little bit more liquidity in their balances than they did pre pandemic thats largely held by affluent and highnetworth individuals our mass market book and even in the mass affluent space theyve sort of moderated back down to operating floors so i think those are all signs that would support a continued slowdown in the rundown of lowcost deposits pending any recessionary impact that may bring them below operating floor so we feel pretty good and just on the uninsured and insured deposit front we saw a little bit of a blip on the uninsured in march and since march that has been incredibly stable and all parts of the book have been growing so all the fundamentals point to continued trajectory and stability and certainly continue to outperform and then in addition to that you know were controlling what we can control were performing in the top quartile in the united states in terms of household acquisition growth the new york market as john pointed out is helping to give us an extra lever to drive lowcost deposit growth over and above just the portfolio trends which are generally outperforming so we do believe weve got a distinctive amount of levers for the franchise to continue to outperform in the mediumterm outlook on a lowcost deposits peter j winter q analyst da davidson co great very helpful and then just one quick housekeeping i just want to confirm john you said that the expense outlook for next year being flat that includes the private bank buildout expenses john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah it does so underlying expenses should be flat next year including the private bank as well as noncore peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 hey thanks good morning just a followup on that last question don i just wanted to ask you i know that the private bank buildout was million of costs this quarter just wondering if theres any changes to your expectation of what that would trend like going forward as part of that cost commentary john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think brendan will probably add some color on this but its pretty similar into the fourth quarter and then of course into next year you see it starting to migrate towards a instead of being an eps drag it gets back to breakeven when you get out into and then more broadly a contribution to eps is our outlook there but go ahead brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah therell be into q4 some very modest upticks in the low potentially and the reasons for that we hired the majority of the team as you all know in the early part of the summer the influences on that nudging up is our successful securing of various different private banking offices coast to coast to house the team and start to bring in customers into the platform some operating expenses clients come on board as well as were playing some very selective secondtier offense theres still a lot of talent in motion and this quarter after the first we also hired another really top alist talent folks in all of those same offices that we opened in the summer and so were going to be selective but as we see the right talent pop up were going to grab them and add them to the team so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island but the other thing just in the way that comp is structured ken that the folks who came over on guarantees as if theyre fully producing so as the revenues come in there wont be incremental costs therell just be kind of earning those pay levels so another factor to consider ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats a great point and then as a followup you guys have done a great job over the years on the top program and just i take your commentary about holding costs flat inclusive of these extra builds that would imply a real turn exiting the year given that youre ramped through the year on costs this year and john i know you mentioned ai as a piece of that increment but youve done 100plus of top each year im just wondering like where else would you be digging in in across the organization to get that magnitude of what seems to be a pretty meaningful implied extra cost save out of the numbers next year thanks guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so its bruce and let me just start off and then john can amplify but the top program i think has been a real consistent contributor to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage but to actually get to flat for next year we have to go beyond that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 so weve geared up a very nice top program and were adding to it but i think were going to have to look at kind of employment levels broadly to see where we can extract some folks and well look at certain business activities that may be less important going forward than what we have been engaged in historically weve already done some of that this year so weve downsized the mortgage business quite a bit we exited the auto business so i think its a combination of actions its continuing to find ways to upsize top leverage things like ai where we can do that look at our overall org structure and staffing levels and see if we can pinch some efficiencies there and then look hard at our business mix and figure out where the key here is not to just have a kneejerk revenues theres revenue pressure in the environment so lets really take a hard knife at all expenses we have to be judicious about where were cutting and protect the things that we feel are really going to help us grow and outperform in the medium term so things like the private banks things like the new york metro expansion theres things that were going to ringfence and then theres other areas were going to have to go a little harder with the knife john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think that that covered it well bruce and just the ongoing fundamentals our bread and butter of focusing on organizational related items and thirdparty spend and the like and i wont repeat all the categories that bruce articulated but weve got a fundamental underpinning that we feel like we have the opportunity to broaden out with while protecting the initiatives that are going to help us outperform over the medium term ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you for the color operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning you have of deposits from consumer so strong franchise there and you noted that you should outperform peers on a relative basis but one of your large peers noted last week that banks may still be overearning on nii so i guess my question was how do you see competitive factors playing out for consumer deposits next year especially if the rate environment stays higher for longer bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island brendan do you want to brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we certainly have seen continued heavy competition for consumer deposits youre seeing kind of money market and cd rates in the mid in some spots we feel like were competing really really well on that obviously its supported by our transformation on low cost thats where you kind of start on how you manage strong nii levels and nim levels is having a solid foundation of lowcost highly engaged customers citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 we have probably more levers than other have to manage through whatever the competitive intensity ends up coming our way in certainly we have citizens access which has been an incredibly positive tool for us to grow interestbearing deposits in a smart way with really sticky relationships but also it helps not put too much contagion into the retail banking system with heavy kind of window rates on the front of the branches that may drive in hot money and bring the franchise into nonrelationshipbased banking and so thats been an incredibly effective tool to both raise money and also protect how we manage and compete on interestbearing costs where we have competed in the core franchise with some of the more aggressive rates weve done it in an incredibly relationshipbased way so the access into no pun intended with citizens access access into higher rates on deposits if youre a core banking customer of ours requires you to be in a relationship product we call it quest or private client which is mass affluent or affluent value proposition so when you do more with us you get more that strategy has enabled us to be more targeted on how we think about introducing interestbearing cost into the environment that were able to protect and retain balances in a really thoughtful way versus reprice the entire book in some spots so yeah its intense out there we expect that to continue through the first half of the year as deposits are sort of hard to come by to the us banking system but we think we got the right tools and the right levers to continue to win and compete well with our peers john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and just maybe just to add all great points there and just to add one other point about this i mean the rate environment is expected to become more constructive i guess is the point meaning if youre raising deposits in a world where the yield curve is inverted or at best getting less inverted thats always going to be a tricky situation for banks until it becomes a more stable upward slopping situation which i think its a little more likely to be the case as you get into and certainly to the end of when you start seeing lower shortterm rates and nevertheless an attractive longterm rate where we can basically deploy our capital and make a positive return so thats really what i think is going to shake out as you get into bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i mean other one last piece of color i would add is that as we enter were still kind of having a net loan shrink and thatll eventually turn around as the private banks starts to put on loans and well see where the economy is but were not pressured to grow deposits given that dynamic on loans we can still see the ldr improve just by keeping loans stable or even letting them drop a little bit so factoring that into the calculus of do you really need to be aggressive given thats your dynamic around loans and deposits that helps you manage the cost of your deposit franchise manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you i appreciate all the color there and just separately on the lcr requirements you mentioned that youre compliant in both category i and category iii now and that this bill is also niineutral but i guess the question is how much more do you think you need to build from here and how do you think about that increasing your asset sensitivity in the long run citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i theres just a couple of questions in there i mean i think the regulatory requirements are generally inducing banks to become more assetsensitive youve got the issue of more broadly if the longterm debt rule goes in that would be along with having to hold liquidity that is shorter duration thats going to cause assetsensitivity to grow over time were naturally an assetsensitive bank and those forces would cause us to be more assetsensitive so well have to consider in the coming and during the transition periods whether it makes sense to moderate those positions with offbalance sheet types of actions but nevertheless theres generally a tailwind of assetsensitivity being created from the regulatory environment but also idiosyncratic to us our noncore portfolio as that runs off thats mostly a fixed book and that has a tailwind to assetsensitivity were around neutral now so becoming a bit more assetsensitive over time is some of the underlying forces there that i would say are in place and well decide as the environment plays out whether how and whether to moderate that and again the liquidity build is niineutral so its really not a driver and its something that again at the nii guide of down is really driven by basically having a the exliquidity build nim decline is really the driver of that and equates to the that youre seeing in the guide so thats the way to pull it all together for manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt connor sic matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i want to talk earlier in the call in terms of noninterest income trajectory for next year and all the puts and takes but i just want to circle back on that in a sustainable rate environment so kind of higher for longer when and around what level does the net interest income dollars start to bottom john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean were still working through our outlooks right so were going to be much more i would say transparent about what our expectations are for as you get into planning season here and completing that and of course we do that in january with that said we broadly as you look at the swap trajectory for us into we have a swap portfolio growing right around the time that the forwards would indicate the fed would begin to cut and matter of fact as i mentioned earlier theres you could actually see deviation around that and we happen to have a view that is likely that itll actually come in a little lower than where the forwards had it coming in at the end of citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 so thatll be a mitigant and as i mentioned the noncore rundown is a mitigant and private bank as that grows is of course accretive the other thing ill mention i mean if you get beyond and you look at whats happening in the through timeframes its certainly more consistent with a more neutral fed posture that would represent regardless of what the transition is in that would represent a significant tailwind getting into to as you see the swap portfolio being more of a neutral impact to net interest margin and nii and so working our way through we get some really nice tailwinds and thats just on the active swap portfolio we also have a lockedin and bakedin tailwind from the terminated swaps which run off as you can see on our slide in a significant way over to so i would call a transition year while the fed normalizes rates and our balance sheet optimization takes hold with noncore and creates this create a lot of momentum as you look out into and beyond bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add a little color here matt to you and erikas question i think erika was looking for john to say are you still holding at in the fourth quarter this year and the fourth quarter next year i think the reluctance to draw a line in the sand on is the amount of the liquidity build and that some of the cards from the regulators on new liquidity regulation arent turned over yet so just putting that aside if you just say thats a bit of an unknown do we still have an ambition to have our exit rate at the end of be roughly the exit rate at the end of yeah that would still be the ambition we have to go through the work as john said to go through kind of the budget process for next year but thats still where wed be hoping to arrive matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just in terms of the impact of rate cuts versus higherforlonger scenario what does higherforlonger do versus the rate cuts because it sounds like youre still a little asset sensitive but the rollon of the swaps would obviously benefit from rate cuts so whats the net impact if rates are stable versus what the forward curve has for next year is it better or worse john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say id say that where were positioned yeah were right around neutral a small increase in rates is actually positive to our platform a large we tend to calculate the stuff using the 100basispoint and basispoint gradual rises were relatively neutral in those kinds of calculations which youll see disclosures on in our 10q but when it comes to just another hike or and those kinds of conversations meaning we tend to in those environments continue to make money and have a positive impact to nii the other way so generally the forward curve is favorable to us i think we like the tracking of the forward curve we start getting cuts at the end of and that allows the continued front book back book we like the long end citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 being more anchored a little higher that helps too in terms of our originations at our fixed rate loan book so again and it also provides opportunities to later on lock in higher rates to the extent that thats desirable so the forward curve is i think constructive for us plus or minus is fine i think large moves either way is where we would say it starts to kind of create potential headwinds but other than that were feeling we feel okay with it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so to summarize steeper is better as a good rule of thumb john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island id say forward curve is better and plus or minus is not going to move the needle very much so having some cuts and a slow i mean in general over the long term banks do better were maturity intermediary when rate when we have an upward sloping yield curve so the short rates are at we think that that its more constructive to see short rates around to over the long term we also think its constructive to have 10year thats north of in that same environment so therefore a gradual decline from down to about to over the next two years we think is not only good for us but good for the industry and allow us to get back to an upward sloping yield curve and i think that thats the environment where we would be performing in a very good way that said we pivot and manage to the extent that the rate environment migrates differently than that but thats the one that i would say works out the best for us and the industry as a whole matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay makes sense thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks i guess i have a couple of clarifications given all the discussions going on john when you said lets start with expenses you talked about underlying expenses to be flat next year but then you also said that includes private bank and noncore noncore is not included in the way you define underlying expenses so are you saying both underlying which is core and reported expenses are both going to be flat next year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island no its underlying expenses at the top of the house will be flat next year versus underlying includes private bank it includes noncore overall cfg expenses will be flat in versus citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah underlying does not exclude those things today vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island it includes those things vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so i want to but all these definitions everybody has a little difference so its important to clarify that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you the second one i guess john going back to the rates discussion just trying to get my head wrapped around that if i heard you right just in response to matts question you said small increase in rates is beneficial to nii but then rate cuts is also positive so im trying to reconcile how both scenarios are positive for you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i can clarify that vivek i mean a small increase in rates from here would drive some nii a small amount of nii and a small decline would be a small negative event in terms of a small decline in nii but theyre both quite small which is why were calling ourselves neutral but just from a positioning standpoint it would be a small positive if rates rose from here and with lets say one additional hike for example lets say that if the fed has a hike in the fourth quarter in november or december well see an nii contribution to that a small cut goes the other way and also but not a significant decline if there was a cut vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and to be clear the difference here is what happens immediately say in the next quarter versus what happens over time citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 we are very constructive and feel very good about a gradual decline in rates where the short end gets down to to over call it a orderly period of time we think thats very good and it gives time for balance sheets to adjust and to have front book back books continue to get locked in and be supportive of a healthy balance sheet migration over the next call it year or two as our balance sheet optimization continues to take hold with noncore runoff etcetera so we would our balance sheet does well with an upward sloping balance sheet that will migrate to over the call it the and early period vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and one more clarification thats helpful on the expenses bruce when you talk about stable for next year what are you assuming for capital markets are you assuming for capital markets revenues and therefore incentive comp goes up or are you just using current level any color on that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well we havent given the full guidance yet on but there is a variable element of pay that if revenues go up in capital markets that pay would go up thats probably the one area that has the greatest tie to revenues across the bank and we would have to contemplate that as we go through the budget process so we said were targeting the flat expenses for next year and we would incorporate our view on kind of where the capital markets fees are going to be and then what additional payouts would result from that and then wed have to find ways to offset that elsewhere in the bank vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks operator and at this time there are no further questions with that ill turn the call over to mr van saun for closing remarks bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks again for dialing in today we certainly appreciate your interest and support have a great day thank you very much
