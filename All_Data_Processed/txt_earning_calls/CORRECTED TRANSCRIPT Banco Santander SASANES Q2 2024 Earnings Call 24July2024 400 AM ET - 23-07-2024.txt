of our results in the first half of are the following q2 was another record quarter for santander which shows the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model profit reached billion thats above q2 even after the impact of million of onetime charges net of taxes and minorities excluding them recurring profit was billion in q2 profit in the first half reached billion also a record high up supported by the strong cost of revenue growth in all regions and global businesses we continued to accelerate one transformation to become simpler more automated and more integrated as a result our efficiency ratio improved by basis points to the best in years and our return on tangible equity rose basis points to or if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in spain finally our solid balance sheet with a sound capital ratio solid credit quality and a strict capital discipline help us reach strong profitable growth and shareholder value creation with tnav plus dividend per share increasing lets stop for a moment in our income statement as always we present growth rates in both current and constant euros this quarter there were no material differences between them since last quarter we have reported variation in constant euros in all countries except argentina which is shown in current euros to mitigate the distortions from hyperinflation in q2 we have taken a prudent approach again and used an inflation adjusted exchange rate for the argentine peso given the significant divergence between inflation and the official effects although it has little impact when comparing half years distortions are more significant when we compare with q1 our pl is strong from top to bottom revenue was alltime high with record nii and fees supported by all global businesses and regions second expenses increased below inflation and below revenue on good cost management and costs has been stable for four quarters in a row third we have reported net operating income growing doubledigit for nine consecutive quarters demonstrating the sustainability of our results fourth loan loss provisions continued to normalize as expected the highest profit ever as i mentioned before was achieved even after onetime charges these were additional swiss mortgage provision in poland reaching coverage of million from the write down of our merchant platform in germany and superdigital in latin america that i will explain in more detail later on additionally we have positive and negative oneoff impacts in brazil which do not affect profit and have been netted in the underlying pl this as you can see is a strong first half of the year with solid commercial and business dynamics that already puts us ahead of our plan for as a result we have upgraded some of our targets for the year we have increased our revenue growth target to highsingle digit with better nii and fee income we have improved our efficiency ratio target to around as accelerating one transformation leads to higher operational leverage and we have raised our rote target to above versus the previous we are also confirming the rest of our targets for the year cost of risk is expected to remain stable at around on active risk management and strong labor markets as a reference yeartodate cost of risk was even with additional provisions that i just described in poland in capital our cet1 ratio ended june at with a strong organic capital generation in line with our target to be above even after the basel iii implementation one transformation and the operational leverage it brings are behind our record performance is structurally improving both revenue and cost performances simplifying and automating processes plus our active spread management have already contributed basis points of efficiencies since we started our global businesses banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 continued to push the groups profitability and have delivered basis point in efficiency gains finally our proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated basis points in efficiencies so far as we have often said we are going back to basics which supports value creation based on profitable growth how by focusing on offering customers the best products and user experience and by obtaining the operational leverage from global platforms and common tech this is reflected in the performance of our global businesses our retail and consumer businesses efficiency ratio improved by basis points and basis points respectively in cib we are building a worldclass business leveraging our expertise to grow in the us maintaining our risk profile revenue grew another record supported by the strong performance and client flows in the us wealth continued its strong growth improving efficiency and profitability and in payments where we manage over million cards in the group we have significantly improved profitability as a reminder in q1 of last year we had a onetime fee from a commercial agreement in brazil excluding this impact payments revenue would be up and efficiency would have improved by basis points even after investing in the global platforms in the coming five slides i will review the advances on each of our global businesses lets start with retail where we are working to become the number one bank for our customers it is a great example of the benefits from one transformation innovation helps to offer the best customer experience in mexico for example our new digital processes helped onboarding time and led to a record digital account openings just last month our common operating model across our banks automation and digitalization frees up time of our people to focus on commercial activities dedication of resources to noncommercial activities has dropped versus last year deployment of our global platform has continued in the us it has been successfully completed within the group gravity is already operational in spain the uk mexico brazil and chile and it is processing a number of transactions that is around higher yearonyear financially were extracting the potential from todays favorable conditions in our footprint as we benefit from our diversification we carefully manage margins in the higher for longer rate environment in europe and keep capturing the benefits from our negative sensitivity to rates in south america and while we achieve a strong capital a strong operational leverage across the group as a result our profit grew yearonyear rote up basis points to on the back of revenue up doubledigit on good performance of nii and fees with all regions growing especially europe and south america cost is well under control down in real terms reflecting the structural benefits from our transformation and provision and cost of risk fairly stable at comfortable levels in consumer we strive to be the partner of choice for our customers our bestinclass global solutions are integrated into our partners processes for example last year we launched a new digital onboarding to pure direct auto players which allows them to offer their customers the completion of their auto finance online endto end in very little time we are progressing well in deposit gathering to increase nii stability and autonomous funding across the interest rate cycle deposits were up year on year supported by our digital solutions we expect positive trends to continue helped by the launch of our deposit gathering platforms banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business reducing cost to serve and improving profitability in checkout lending we recently launched installments loans with apple in germany through zinia which we are looking to expand to other european countries consumer had a great quarter on its operational leverage which resulted in doubledigit growth in net operating income and a profit increase in h1 with number one strong revenue driven by positive commercial dynamics with higher volumes mainly in europe and brazil good nii performance and fee growth from insurance number two cost falling in real terms on the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans executed last year and third higher provisions mainly swiss franc mortgages and expected cost of risk normalization in europe and the us volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that consumer will end with a profit growth of around doubledigit even after the normalization of provisions we are building a world class cib business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to grow profit while maintaining the same low risk profile we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the us building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across regions our collaboration in the us with the rest of the group is starting to pay off with several firsts for example we made our first corporate share buyback for a us company and we were appointed global coordinator for a uslisted ipo for the first time ever in mexico we are creating a significant partnership within the mexicous corridor leveraging our global markets and us bank buildout sic us banking buildout initiatives and these are just a few examples from a long list as a result revenue in cib in the us rose year on year this strong growth reflects the benefits of our us banking buildout initiative which will become even more evident in the coming quarters we continue to spend and strengthen our centers of expertise including key industry groups such as chemicals technology and paper and packaging our cib business is capitallight very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace year on year our active capital management continue to support indiscernible origination and high profitability levels in essence cib had great results increasing revenue in h1 year on year even after a record first half in making h1 the best ever with fees growing at double digits and the vast majority of our growth coming from customer flows moving on to wealth management insurance we continue to build the best bank private bank in each and insurance manager in europe and the americas how number one by improving customer relationships through the best service and right solutions resulting in doubledigit growth in private banking customers second collaboration with other businesses especially retail and cib which is a major driver for growth and allows us to capture network benefits collaboration fees increased by year on year third developing global platforms across all three businesses and digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth a good example of this is auto compara our auto insurance comparison engine that operates in six countries and which we are expanding to new segments and businesses in summary were accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability attributable profit rose doubledigit on a strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with total fees from all three businesses growing at double digit and cost up slightly in real terms finally efficiency improved basis points year on year and rote rose to basis points to over banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 finally payments where we have our unique positions on both sides of the value chain one issuing where we manage more than million cards worldwide and second in merchant acquiring in merchant we are the second largest acquirer in latin america and a market leader in spain and portugal with the right balance between growth and profitability we are gaining market share in most markets as we strengthened getnets customer value proposition with new global solution an example is dynamic currency conversion in mexico which has helped getnet to become second in mexico with a market share and a ebitda margin in q2 we continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to pagonxt global platform to leverage the group scale the transactions managed globally through pagonxt payments surpassed billion per year during the first half of this year with ph growth quarter on quarter the rollout of plard our global cards platform is on track we continue to increase the number of debit cards managing plard at a good pace and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio we plan to manage around million cards through plard in brazil by yearend as i mentioned earlier we recorded oneoff charges in pagonxt from the writedown of investments one is the discontinuation of our merchant platform in germany we announced in june as we are focusing on our current acquiring value proposition in our core markets where we have a very competitive business the other one is our decision to write down superdigital a natural step to promote the use of common platforms across the group and maximize operational leverage these decisions will enable a more stable and profitable business reducing fixed cost going forward excluding these impacts underlying performance was very positive profit in payments was up year on year on good revenue performance costs falling in real terms while we invest in our common platforms and sound credit quality in cards pagonxts ebitda margin improved to one of the best among competitors we expect the consistent execution of our strategy efficiency and capex optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters today results show that our strategy has enabled us to deliver outstanding profitability growth in h1 with double digit shareholder value creation for the fifth consecutive quarter rote was up basis points year on year reflecting the high levels of profitability at which we are ph originally originating new business eps rose to nearly thats around year on year and we delivered growth in shareholder value creation supported all by strong profit generation our strict discipline in capital allocation and share buybacks we have repurchased around of our outstanding shares in the last three years returning around billion through buybacks and providing a return on investment of to our shareholders i leave you now with josé to go into our financial performance in more detail please josé josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor and good morning everyone like always i will go into a bit more detail in the pl and the capital ratio but let me start by making some general comments the first one is that our record profits include as héctor mentioned million from oneoffs coming basically from the writedowns in pagonxt and additional provisions in the swiss franc mortgage portfolio in poland we also had a oneoff in brazil related to capital gain from the transaction we announced with sodexo but we use that amount to strengthen the balance sheet so no impact on the bottom line we achieved these results as our transformation continues to drive operational leverage with very positive momentum both in europe and in latin america at the same time revenue grew with the highest nii and fee income in our history and costs were down slightly in real terms as a result operating income was up banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 provisions increased even after including the million increase in swiss franc provisions that we took in the quarter on the righthand side you can see the upward trend in profit quarter on quarter at which was driven by top line growth with lower cost and provisions fairly flat as i just mentioned let me now spend a couple of minutes on the reasons why were starting to use a new inflationadjusted exchange rate in argentina rather than the official one we have observed a significant divergence between the official exchange rate and inflation and we have decided to follow a prudent accounting approach the new exchange rate is the result of adjusting the official exchange rate with a differential between the inflation in argentina and in the us this is a very conservative approach and a much more conservative way of recognizing the actual value in euros of our results and our investment in argentina and this should mitigate the volatility that the currency might experience in the future as you all remember was the case in following these accounting rules we have recorded the full q1 and q2 impacts from this adjustment in q2 which does not significantly affect the yearonyear figures but it has significant impact and causes some distortions when we look at quarter on quarter and i will try to show these differences in the coming slides for instance nii is dropping is down in the quarter but if we exclude argentina the groups nii would have gone up something similar happens with fees instead of decreasing in the quarter or increasing they would have increased and cost would have been fairly flat if this exchange rate does not materialize we would revert this adjustment and account for the results that we are not recognizing today but it looks to us that this is a prudent more conservative way of recognizing our investment and results in argentina there was a strong total revenue growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter which made up more than of total revenue this strong growth was primarily supported by retail retail accounts as you know for more than of our businesses and is growing at doubledigits with very good performance in nii across regions and fees also growing especially in the americas and also consumer which is reaching good profitability levels in new businesses and a strong loan growth in europe and latam corporate investment banking also had a good quarter as revenue reached an alltime high both in the quarter and in the first half of the year particularly in spain in the us and in mexico also doubledigit growth in wealth as héctor mentioned driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management payments also performing very well particularly if we exclude the onetime positive impact recorded in brazil in the first quarter of as you remember which we explained and héctor just mentioned where we had a oneoff from an agreement with mastercard and finally the corporate centres higher liquidity buffer remuneration was offset by higher tlacmrel issuances and the negative impact from fx hedging most of our revenue growth came from nii which continued to increase in the quarter if we exclude argentina particularly driven by retail consumer and cib which represented of groups nii on the slide you can see that we are in this small box in red put in the figure that we would have recorded if we had used the official argentina exchange rate so this is important to keep this in mind and to show again that what we have decided to do is a prudent accounting of our profits coming from argentina nii rose yearon year supported by all businesses and regions on the back of very active price management in retail europe especially in deposits also higher volumes and the benefits of negative sensitivity to interest rates in south america in retail south america and in consumer which is now very evident especially in brazil and chile and very good levels of activity in corporate investment banking in terms of profitability we have improved net interest margin yearonyear explained by higher yield on assets as we continue repricing our books but also very good management of deposit costs which more than basically banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 outweighed the pressures that we are seeing its true that the margin is expanding as you can see if we exclude argentina or if we had used the official exchange rate so overall the margin management pricing management on both the asset side and liability side is really strong we see a slight deterioration though if we use our official exchange rate our adjusted exchange rate although its not very significant in the quarter going forward we would expect some marginal margin pressure in europe that will be more than compensated by positive contribution from the americas and our consumer business in the context of low fee growth in general across the sector as a result of subdued loan demand we generated another record quarter in fee income billion with solid growth all across the five businesses retail increased basically driven by brazil north america and poland outstanding performance in consumer on the back of very strong insurance businesses corporate investment banking also grew from already very high levels in the first half of last year especially in the us wealth supported by very strong private banking activity and payments as we mentioned was affected by the onetime fee recorded in brazil last year structural efficiency gains from our transformation program are very evident quarter after quarter cost to income was the best level that we have reported for the last years and one of the best in the sector its already better than the levels that we guided for cost declined quarteronquarter were very flattish if we exclude argentina after having been stable for the last three quarters with revenue growing steadily quarterafterquarter improving an increase in operational leverage that we obviously expect to continue to have in the second half of the year and into average inflation continued its gradual decline down from a year ago to below this quarter in this context cost fell in real terms yearonyear despite that as you all know we have some lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation by businesses cost remained well under control in retail consumer and payments which represent of our cost base and of the increase as you can see on the bottom of the chart came from cib reflecting our strategy to reinforce our corporate investment banking franchise in fact if we exclude this investment cost in the rest of the group would have decreased in real terms credit quality remained very much under control obviously its supported by stable economic environment and our active risk management all across the group cost of risk was remember that we look at the last months if we look at the first half of the year cost of risk was even including the increase in the provisions for the swiss franc mortgage portfolio in argentina so we are very much on target to reach the for the year and we reiterate that target in the second half we expect that trends in consumer and mexico will be closer to more normalized levels but this will be offset by a better performance in retail europe and south america turning to capital and closing my section here our cet1 ratio remains at very comfortable level backed by strong organic capital generation and significant riskweighted asset rotation this quarter we generated basis points organically supported by our asset rotation initiatives to compensate organic riskweighted asset growth we recorded basis points charge for shareholder remuneration in line with our payout and finally there was a 7basis point negative impact mainly related to intangibles the valuation of availableforsale portfolios and others there were no significant regulatory impacts in the quarter we continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity our disciplined capital allocation has resulted in a new book return on riskweighted assets of in the quarter which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of well above that of our back book at our centralized asset management desk which aims at optimizing capital deployment is achieving outstanding results in the first half we disposed off an amount of capital equivalent of billion in riskweighted assets at a cost of capital of half of that of the new originations in addition the one banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by the more profitable new businesses at this return on tangible equity of the combination of these actions explain the expanding profitability and the increasing capital ratio let me turn it now back to héctor for his conclusions héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé as our results clearly show we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for in our last investor day thanks to our unique business model and execution of our strategy with a strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans further improving our profitability to above and by growing both profit and profitability sustainably we have been able to deliver value creation to our shareholders we said it in our investor day and i want to remind you again we have entered a new phase for value creation for our shareholders in conclusion the benefits from the execution of our strategy are very evident the strong growth in revenue with flattish cost and around growth in eps and the best ever h1 profit with alltime high nii fees and net operating income backed by strong performance in all our businesses and regions sustained progress in our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model leveraging the groups scale is driving both high revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have ever reported in the last years our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and doubledigit shareholder value creation as a result we expect to exceed some of our targets for we are upgrading our revenue growth target to high singledigits efficiency to run and as we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities we are improving our profitability target to above our focus at santander is to be reliable in providing returns that compound on an always increasing quantum of tangible book value consistently and through the cycle based on both business and geographic diversification the progress of the last years to simplify and align our model in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident and now depends on execution to continue to deliver on our primary target of doubledigit tnav plus dps growth through the cycle and now we will be happy to take all your questions thank you begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and héctor we can start the qa session now please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we already have our first question from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi this is sofie from jpmorgan thanks a lot for taking my questions so my first question would be on the risk transfers did i hear you correctly that you saw billion of riskweighted asset disposals in the quarter and maybe you could just talk about the decline in riskweighted assets i see riskweighted assets especially in spain were down around quarteronquarter in digital consumer bank minus quarteronquarter but in both entities the loan book grew by quarteronquarter so how should we think about these srts or securitizations and what will be the revenue impacts going forward from securitizing some of the loans and also related to that if you could just remind us on the regulatory capital headwinds that are coming in the second half and then my second question would be on ebury there has been quite a few press articles suggesting that you are looking to potentially ipo ebury can you just remind us what the tangible book value per share is or tangible book value for these businesses how much revenue you get from ebury and what your kind of plans for ebury is thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sofie i mean first of all i mean our policy basically has been to as josé was explaining in detail to rotate the balance sheet as much as we can this is basically a very important change for us given the high capabilities that we have to reunite assets so this is basically helping us to rotate and also giving us a new basically i would say a turbocharger in the sense that with every single time that we sell something we basically reuse that capital or redeploy that capital within the organization at a much better price so thats exactly what were doing and rotating the capital in a much better way as josé was explaining you well rotate a third of the balance sheet every year and since were very focused on profitability were actually reinvesting better and better and thats actually a new way of basically managing the balance sheet of the bank then josé can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining about it in terms of regulatory capital as we told you our guidance is basically to be above after regulatory charges et cetera so we continue to basically hang on to that number above and as i said and josé basically reiterated were going to be above the after basel iii as well and in terms of the ipo of ebury well give you the details josé will give you the details on that thank you josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa hi sofie first of all the billion was riskweighted assets in the first half so more or less of these is srts but the rest is other types of transactions like asset sales hedges et cetera the cost of mobilizing this billion was around in rote equivalent we always look at rorwa but just to use the same currency everywhere in rote equivalent the cost of mobilizing these billion was slightly below and we reinvested the capital as i said at so there was at least percentage points difference on these billion in riskweighted assets billion in riskweighted assets is close to billion in capital times this so on an annualized basis we generated increased profits with the same capital of around million we banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 expect to continue doing this the demand for private credit is significant we have a very busy second half of the year its difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays et cetera but we expect to mobilize much more than last year and as you can see from the figures i gave you this is very profitable capital headwinds this year we still expect basis points to basis points in the second half of the year basel iii as héctor mentioned fully loaded and when we mention fully loaded its fully loaded even taking into account those impacts that come in we will be comfortably above and the day one impacts will be very relatively small as we mentioned before and in the case of ebury we are always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage so there were some news that we are contemplating an ipo in ebury again we are looking at all types of alternatives to maximize the capital this is one of them that doesnt necessarily mean that this will be executed and again this will be put as one of our several capital management initiatives that we have across the group begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst bnp paribas sa hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i have two questions the first one is on the revenue performance we have seen a very good performance in europe probably a bit better than what we expected at least expected at the beginning of the year latam has been lagging a bit behind with brazil being softer how should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half when you have upgraded the revenue guidance to high singledigits from the currently should we expect second half in line with these levels kind of getting a little bit of a sense whether latam should offset the weakness of europe that you have flagged josé during the call in margin and the second question is on the uk if you could elaborate a bit what should we expect in terms of nii for the uk it looks nims are stabilizing so trying a bit of getting your thoughts on the outlook for the uk thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you ignacio i mean first of all let me tell you as you have said revenue has been very strong much stronger than we believed at the beginning rates have helped but also the good performance of our different businesses as you know we are very focused on profitability in the way were structuring things and the nav basically is paying off i believe that i mean revenue will continue basically to give good results i dont see that latam has a weakness i see that actually latam is going to be doing very well in the second half and you can see also very good results coming out of what we are doing in retail in brazil and also chile is doing quite a good performance mexico basically on retail were changing the mix and thats why you see the flat nii in there but i mean it will continue to give very good results so we expect a very good second half of the year in terms of revenue and in that sense basically what you were asking about the uk uk was a better second half first of all we see that the market is a little bit more rational competition has been much rational than we saw during the first quarter second quarter has stabilized we also some of the strategies we have done in terms of betas are paying off so i believe that all in all uk will have a much better second half of the year than we have seen in terms of retail basically its more rational behavior as i told you fees are not going to be doing that well banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 due to the future campaign that we structured but benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter much better than the way we basically saw it and what youre going to see is also a very good cost control because we have cost control initiatives coming into the uk which are going to make the business perform much better than we saw i dont know if josé would like to complement a little bit on the revenue side but josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa i think im sure that you will ask about nii you mentioned that revenue in europe is better than you expected at the beginning of the year we guided for a drop in nii in the eurozone we now see nii in the eurozone particularly in spain portugal et cetera up midsingledigits obviously rates are higher for longer so much better performance in nii we have hedged a substantial amount of our balance sheets in the eurozone basically through the alco portfolio hedging the assets particularly mortgages and also swapping our fixed liabilities into variable liabilities and it means that the sensitivity of our nii in europe going forward is going to be significantly lower than we had before so as héctor mentioned we expect fairly stable maybe a slightly down nii in spain in the second half of the year and next year but at the same time we continue to see good momentum coming from south america brazil and particularly chile so we are constructive on the future evolution of nii and revenue in the second half begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi good morning can i ask couple of follow ups on just wanted to confirm the comment you just made around midsingledigit in spain nii that implies i think almost reduction halfonhalf which it feels a bit substantial so i dont know if i have done my math very quickly wrong or if you can sort of add a bit of color on that and then on the performance in fees in the us could you give us a bit of color on the obviously very strong performance but if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on is it ecm dcm just to form an opinion of how sustainable it is going forward if i can slip in a third youve mentioned over capital but i thought the target was at the end of the year so can you just confirm thats the case and we should still expect the basis points basis points regulatory headwinds thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you alvaro first of all let me talk about capital in capital we have always said were going to be above and that basically has been the guidance were at right now and we said as josé basically reiterated that were going to be above even after basel iii fully loaded thats exactly the guidance in terms of performance in the us fees the majority is basically the cib our business in cib is the one that is driving and also a little bit in terms of good performance in retail that were having a little bit also in the us but cib is the main driver it grew yearonyear quarteronquarter as you know cib business is cyclical so we have pretty good mandates the business is basically doing well and also a very good connection in between what were doing with the us as i explained during the presentation with the business in latin america and the business in europe banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 whats happening and let me explain a little bit is some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of dcm that we wouldnt get because we wouldnt be seen as a dollar house were becoming one and youll see us top three in the league tables right now in latin america doing dollar transactions not just to the corporates but also to the governments i mean when indiscernible transaction at the beginning of the year billion we were one of the principal bookrunners in the transaction so youre starting to see that because of the indiscernible that we did in the us so thats starting to payoff i believe that with the four teams that we added i think its going to complement the rest of the business and will continue driving fees up but lets see what happens with the cyclicality of the business on the other side retail is also performing well in fees and we believe that it continue to do so over the rest of the year in terms of what we indiscernible in terms of spain partly performance loans are starting to reprice at lower rates while deposits betas are behaving very well this is helping contain the cost of deposits also as josé explained you in detail alco volumes are helping and the lower cost of the hedging which were not in place before are now in place so its going to help us nii as josé said is reaching its peak but i expect nii to grow midsingledigits in better performance than we expected at the beginning of the year and its also because of the higher for longer rates environment that were experiencing i dont know if josé would like to add something josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah in terms of details alvaro i mean its first half against first half nii in spain is up so if we grew zero in the second half the yearonyear would be around so i dont understand where you get the minus if i go quarter on quarter nii in spain was started in the third quarter of last year million fourth quarter million first quarter of this year million second quarter million we would expect the million to be the peak and then slightly down in the second half probably to very very similar levels that we had in the second half of last year and we expect to be able to keep that same level in in terms of capital to basis points headwinds taking into account that we generate to basis points bau you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by yearend the guidance of is post basel iii fully loaded begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from marta sanchez romero from citi please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you very much ive got a couple of followups in the us so youre still struggling to deliver positive jaws when do you think things will turn around there do you think that we will see positive jaws in the second half of the year in the us as well your pl still remains pretty supported by tax credits can you help us understand how the tax line will look like in the next few quarters and then if i may ask do you think the new reporting is helping investors understand santander better because judging by your low pe i think not so i would like to hear your thoughts there thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you marta okay let me explain you a little bit whats going on in the us if you look it by business youre going to see the retail is actually having lower cost than it used to have because of the transformation even with the strong investment were doing in transformation but we have done a really good cost reduction and we believe were going to perform better the jaws are negative due to the fact that were investing in cib and cib as you understand i mean cost a lot to do it so if were going to have a second half that is better ph it is going to start looking better but its going to depend on the cyclicality of the cib business and some of the still people are coming into the team that will start to come in in the next few months as you know there is a period of garden leave et cetera but the main reason is the investment were doing in cib which by in any way is not creating a big investment bank or anything like that this is basically as we said complementing the rest of the business that we have our size is not going to be huge its the size of a really small boutique but its helping us out to beef up and to help us in the remainder of the business and you can see fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact okay in terms of the pl its quite easy to understand the ph dtas are basically what we said last year that when we started doing the electric vehicles i mean we signed contracts with some oems that are generating these ph dtas and thats why youll see that the pl is affected by that and its going to continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing i mean that volume so we have now three things and this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the ph dtas in the us all right and youre going to see that throughout the year in terms of the new reporting its very important to understand what were doing the new reporting is helping us a lot in the way we are managing the business on a daytoday basis okay because its making us work together its making us spend a lot less in the past for example and let me give you a really stupid example i mean we used to have different apps in different banks right now were just having one app being deployed in all the countries for example one app is being deployed today it is being deployed in all of europe the last deployment we did was uk and ph they were deployed in brazil and then we will were deploying also in the us so what happens is basically you use the same around and thats the goal that were basically going through investing just once and ph thats common customization per each country so that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much cheaper way we gave you a pretty good example in what were doing in acquiring when acquiring when the acquiring platform was deployed in mexico it took us in months to number two and you saw the results that i explained i mean how ebitda is growing and i showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market and its just one platform the one that is being deployed now this platform is being deployed down to chile is being deployed to argentina and then we will deploy it in europe in the near future so this is basically helping us to work together and to manage the business in a much better way then in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they are reporting i mean youre going to start getting used to it because its going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way were managing it were reporting now as you can see the operational leverage that were getting by working together in which revenue is going up cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run so its very important that you understand that banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 also let me give you a great example in cib where we have been working together for a long time the same fx factors that we use for mexico brazil spain or the uk are completely the same and its the same product and we just made them once so that basically tells you how were going to be able i mean how we have been able to make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around that i gave you so this is exactly the points that were doing and i believe that this will enable us to give a lot more value to our shareholders there is no way were going to give you more value if we dont work together and do things in a much cheaper way begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can i have the next question please operator next question from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you so two questions for me the first one is on nii in brazil you still maintain the guidance of the growth in the high teens for the year midteens would imply a quarteronquarter fall during the second half if you think this could be the case or not i mean because selic rates have been expectations of cuts have been pushed out so if you can comment on the main drivers of the nii in the coming quarters and also update on the sensitivity of the nii to selic rates in brazil and the second question is about nii in the us we have seen its bottoming out in this second quarter but ph they have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now so you would need to pay up for deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not in this context if you can also comment on the plans to launch openbank what shall we expect there because when i look for example at the digital consumer bank the deposits are growing there by but net interest margin is still falling despite the shift to retail deposits so if you can comment also on this nii trends here thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you francisco let me start with brazil first of all as you have seen i mean very strong and solid numbers coming from brazil nii once again very strong quarter up more than and is up more than in the year okay whats behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth the changing mix and lower rates okay it is true first of all rates outlook has changed the market is expecting smaller than initially anticipated rate cut by the year by yearend and this ultimately mean that nii growth will be a bit less intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year thats a fact okay having said that we still expect brazil nii to grow in the midteens mark by the end of okay so good performance that should continue in and let me tell you that to take the opportunity that brazil has delivered a rote we believe that the end of the year should end up between and strong profitability improvement its not just relying on nii growth but on the good delivery on fees also the cost contention that we have had and expected cost of risk is stable during the year so i remain very optimistic in brazil and the ability to continue expanding the profitability as you have seen in terms of openbank in the us openbank will come into the us with a deposit gathering facility towards september october okay we expect that to come the first phase is deposit gathering and i believe it would banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 be quite successful we had a pretty good plan in place and then well come and well be improving the platform as we see fit in terms of deposits the deposits the transactional deposits that sbna has had remained stable during the year what you have seen the movement in deposits in the us is basically the deposits that we have in cib which are the ones that we decide on profitability whats better for us or not so sometimes because of profitability we basically let them go and we move as we see fit so there is no problem into that and we will continue to see that work in profitability towards every business that we do josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa one quick comment on dcb europe margins and profitability the new business we wrote in was extremely profitable this was postcovid and we have historically high profitability levels this year is going to stay this production is going to stay in our books for three years so its still in our books in it will gradually disappear between and the new business that we are writing in is at rotes of around rorwas of which is much much higher than and annual productions so you should expect in a very substantial pickup in profitability in margins and in profitability in consumer europe because of these in and out of the different productions and the fact that there was an abnormally high profitability in the year following covid begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from álvaro fernándezgarayzábal from ubs please go ahead álvaro fernándezgarayzábal q analyst ubs europe se spain yeah hello good morning and thanks for taking my questions i have two first we assume youre aiming for the upper end of your rote target for next year so that is which implies some meaningful profit increase in versus so my question is geographically where is that earnings growth going to come from and second related to previous questions we have seen revenues improving in the us over the last couple of quarters with volumes up customer spread expanding and fees coming quite strong so basically how sustainable is this revenue pickup going forward thanks héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you álvaro let me start with the us to tell you i believe i mean the us revenue is going to continue to do pretty well but the profitability is always the most difficult in the second part because of seasonality in terms of what happens to us in provisions so what youre going to see is revenue continue to go up quite fairly strong lets see how we do in fees as i said due to the cyclicality of the cib business but revenues will be doing fine in terms of the seasonality lets see how we do in terms of the provisions but we believe and the indication that we have had in terms of provisions show us that theyre coming better the ltm numbers that we have in provisions for the us are much better than last year so look is looking well and so the us shall have a much better year than last year in terms of the rote and josé if you would like to comment banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah obviously we expect profitability to continue to increase on the back of increased audio gap sorry what i was saying is that we expect our profitability to continue to increase on the back of higher operational leverage our transformation program is delivering very positive jaws that we expect to maintain particularly in consumer and retail in the negative the sensitivity to rates in europe has been much decreased as i mentioned before and we should have positive tailwinds coming from nii in south america both brazil and chile so definitely operational leverage is what will continue driving increased profitability in terms of cost of risk no signs of deterioration and looking into the next few quarters we see no signs that we will require to increase our provisions going forward so if you put all of these together again this means that our profits should continue to increase going forward begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from benjamin toms from rbc please go ahead benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd good morning thank you both for taking my questions the first one is on brazil you used million gains to top up your provisioning i think thats the strategy weve adopted before but how comfortable are you that you will need not need to do further topups in brazilian cost of risk going forward another topups to catch up or can we assume that the topups will mean a structurally lower cost of risk in brazil in the coming years and then secondly in the uk in the deck you mentioned that of your hedge income is already locked in for this suggests that either you do not have any maturities this year or you prehedged some of your maturities if you have been prehedging what proportion of structural hedge maturities have you pre hedged and what rates did you lock in at given that swap rates have been volatile and do you expect the tailwind from the structural hedge will overwhelm the headwinds on nii in the uk in thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you okay let me go to brazil okay first of all its very important to tell you that increase in provisions exclusively linked to the loan growth that we have in the country okay cost of risk as you have seen is flat quarteronquarter and credit quality in brazil remains sound and solid its very important to understand that the recent vintages that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration so its performing better than we expected its very important to understand that were also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio just to explain a little bit for example credit cards where in we were making around to credit cards per month today were just growing by credit cards a month and just to our client base so the important thing and the big change is exactly that were not going to react to the open market which was the one that hurt us quite a lot during ph and banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 so thats exactly the change of mix that is helping us also its very important to understand that were very focused on profitability and we have been very opportunistic and we used the proceeds of a corporate transaction to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point and we reiterate that the guidance of delivering is a flattish cost of risk versus okay excluding the oneoffs so thats what i see in terms of brazil in terms of the uk josé please josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so as you know obviously the strategy is to keep the structural hedge position in line with core deposits to protect the balance sheet ahead of decrease in interest rates following the recent increase in market rates and in order to protect the nii we have accelerated the planned investments for amongst other measures so the sensitivity we have today is to a decrease parallel decrease in rates in the uk today is minus million compared to minus million a year ago so roughly we have half of the sensitivity today that we had a year ago the current hedge structural hedge is billion compared with billion in december so this is related to my comment before with duration of years in december it was sorry years in december it was years and the yield is slightly over begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi yes hi good morning so my first question will actually be a followup in spain and sorry indiscernible on this again but did i understood correctly and the message was that in nii should be roughly aligned with the second half of this year where you already expect nii to drop somewhat towards the midsingle digit growth in the full year that you are mentioning and then my second question would actually be on the us evs tax rebate that you have been booking i was just wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that or basically for how long is it in place is it something that we should also witness next year and also is it this federal level rebate or something at a state level and at what extent the potential changes political changes in the us could drive that to disappear or not just to have an idea on the timeframe for which this valid right now thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you carlos all right i mean i think josé gave a pretty good explanation of whats going on in terms of how do we see now i think its important to understand what josé explained you about what were doing on the hedges the alco position that we have that will help also throughout the year even if the rates come down i think were probably in the best ever position in that sense and even that we say i mean the nii will slightly come down over the second half and then well see that we will have a pretty good indiscernible lets see how rates basically behave but i dont know josé if youd like to complement but its basically banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa its exactly what i said carlos its exactly what you said we expect nii to go down slightly in the second half of the year the yearonyear growth against will be somewhere between to and then next year nii should be fairly flat relative to the second half of this year which means that nii should be down slightly low single digits carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi okay josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa because again and this is using the forward rate curves today so if this was to change obviously we will need to update these estimates but using forward curve rates today thats our best estimate for the nii in spain next year and as héctor mentioned this is thanks to the substantial reduction in nii sensitivity that we have conducted in the eurozone in the last year year and a half héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you carlos okay in the us let me walk you through exactly what happens okay first of all let me tell you that is federal okay we dont know if this is going to be sustained if there is a change of government in the us or not i mean i dont want to speculate on that one exactly what happens is every single time we do a lease on an electric vehicle we buy the vehicle in the bank okay so what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle and then we get the cash back or the tax credit and you show the tax credit in one lumped okay during the month in which we do that all right to be exactly how it goes so you dont see the impact in the revenue but the impact you see it in the taxes so thats exactly how it works i dont know if im being correct or i mean if im being clear in the way im explaining to you this but its exactly how it works all right so what we have done is we have a program what we have signed with the oems that were doing this for depends also the capacity that we have to absorb those ph dtas because this is not i mean unlimited this is not i mean we have to have depends on the balance sheet that we have and we have calculated the numbers actually that we can absorb and this is exactly what we negotiate with the oems i dont know if you understood the question in the right way but this is exactly how it works okay and we dont know if its going to happen in the future or not hopefully it continues to be like that begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from miruna chirea from jefferies please go ahead miruna chirea q analyst jefferies international ltd banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 good morning héctor good morning josé thank you for taking my questions i just have a couple of follow ups please on points we touched on before firstly in the uk your nii was slightly up quarteronquarter in q2 so just wondering how you see this progressing from here and is it fair to say that q1 was probably the low point on nii and it should start building from here supported the hedge and what is the shape of this into h2 and also into next year secondly just a clarification on your us business you are talking about some seasonality into the second half of the year in provisions could you please explain what is driving this seasonality and then lastly for brazil also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business when do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you okay so as i said in the uk we see that were going to have a second half better than the first half okay market is more rational both in the margins and in the betas and on top of that cost as i said is going to be slightly better than the first half of the year q2 in nii is showing signs of improvement okay and as i basically explained and we see that betas are not going to go up so that basically will help us in terms of revenue we see mid to single digit decrease in nii down midsingle digits versus last year and fees down lowdouble digit due to the fact that i was explaining about what were doing with the switcher campaign and indiscernible youre going to see that is going to be much better in because exactly were preparing the bank towards that also were very focused on profitability its very important that you understand that okay were not using capital below our cost of equity so were being very tough on that thats exactly why we manage that and then josé i would you like to indiscernible josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah sorry one quick comment the mortgage dynamics in the uk seem to suggest that margins in this business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year just as an additional comment brazil cost of risk we still believe the cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last year remember that when you look at cost of risk quarteronquarter it was a bit substantial increase in the fourth quarter when we look at yearonyear ex the fourth quarter and we look at cost of risk for the full of we would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk so yearonyear because the fourth quarter will come out in the fourth quarter of this year you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth quarter and then provisions in the us are normalizing cost of risk this year should be somehow around or slightly below begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the last question please operator last question from alberto nigro from mediobanca please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 24jul2024 alberto nigro q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes thanks for taking my questions i have a just a few followups the first one is on uk if you can give us more color on the contribution of the uk structural hedge in the second half of this year and in next year and the second one is again on brazil following your comment on the change of the loan mix should we expect a normalization of the cost of risk in the next year and see an absolute decline of total provision next year thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay in terms of brazil were changing the loan mix but we are very flexible and very dynamic in the way we change the loan mix over there depending on what we are seeing and how the vintages are behaving okay so we see that brazil basically and were starting to see positive signs of how the mass market basically reacts is inflation is coming down and we see the rates coming down we might change the mix again and we might be a little bit more aggressive and i couldnt tell you at this point what are we going to do because we revise the strategy every single month of what we do and also the pricing okay so i dont know what the mix is going to be in brazil in but i must tell you that were working in a very dynamic way it is a very dynamic market and you need to be on top of it all right so i couldnt tell you at this point but i mean everything basically is and we do change the mix to sustain the cost of risk at reasonable levels and thats the intent that we have in order to manage that all right josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so uk nii i think i gave you all the details to calculate that i gave you the maturity the rates the amount and everything else in terms of cost of risk in brazil rates this year are expected to stay at by yearend but to dropped significantly next year and that should help in addition to the structure of the balance sheet lower rates next year in brazil will help not only in terms of nii but also cost of risk it will be a gradual improvement we need to see exactly how we will build the business in in brazil but definitely lower rates should help begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé thank you héctor and thank you all for your attendance and if there are any further questions santander
