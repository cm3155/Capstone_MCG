everyone and thanks for joining our call ill begin on slide in the fourth quarter we reported earnings per share of which included per share of notable items that john will discuss in more detail excluding these notable items earnings per share totaled in the fourth quarter for the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis net revenue totaled billion and for the full year we generated record net revenue of billion we demonstrated strength across our fee businesses which helped to offset pressure on net interest income turning to slide total loans were lower on a linked quarter basis by reflecting slower demand particularly in corporate lending and continued focus on lending opportunities that meet our return hurdles average deposits declined compared with the third quarter as our strong funding position allowed us to be more disciplined on deposit pricing while maintaining our liquidity profile credit quality continued to normalize towards prepandemic levels this quarter and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding million to our loan loss reserve as of december tangible book value per share increased from a year ago and our common equity tier capital ratio ended the year at an increase of basis points this quarter this ratio is basis points higher than when we completed the acquisition of union bank in the fourth quarter of supported by our us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 strong capital accretion this year the board approved an increase to our quarterly common dividend in december to per common share slide provides key performance metrics on an adjusted basis we delivered return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter and return on tangible common equity for the full year let me now turn the call over to john who will provide more details on the quarter as well as forwardlooking guidance john c stern senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy turning to slide we reported diluted earnings per share of for the quarter or per share after adjusting for notable items notable items totaled billion on a pretax basis or million net of tax representing a reduction per diluted common share including an fdic special assessment charge of million offset by a benefit from tax settlements in the quarter other notable items this quarter included merger and integration costs of million a charitable contribution to fund our community benefits plan of million and a balance sheet optimization charge of million this quarter we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment securities portfolio which we expect will enhance our net interest income trajectory while also strengthening our capital and liquidity positioning slide provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter turning to slide we continued to manage the balance sheet prudently as we saw reduced loan demand this quarter and the competition for deposits remained heightened as systemwide liquidity declined total assets ended the year at billion average loans declined on a linked quarter basis as growth in credit card loans supported by consumer spending and low payment rates was more than offset by weaker commercial loan demand average deposits declined linked quarter given our strong deposit balances in the third quarter we moderated our deposit pricing somewhat in the fourth quarter even as we grew consumer deposits by during the quarter we rebalanced a portion of our securities portfolio which provided riskweighted asset relief and improved our overall earnings trajectory the average yield on total investment securities portfolio increased for the fourth quarter a 55basis point increase compared to a year earlier as of december the ending balance on the total investment securities portfolio was billion during the quarter effective duration on the availableforsale portfolio declined to less than three years as unrealized losses net of tax improved by approximately billion given the movement in rates and repositioning turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined linked quarter driven by a modest decline in the net interest margin of the 3basis point decline in the net interest margin reflected market dynamics including deposit pricing pressure and unfavorable shifts in the deposit mix partially offset by better earning asset spreads and improved total funding mix in the first quarter of we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of billion to billion for the full year we expect net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter net interest income level of approximately billion to up slightly us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 slide highlights trends in noninterest income noninterest income as adjusted increased on a year overyear basis driven by new account growth and deepening relationships across the business yearoveryear payment service revenue benefited by continued strength in consumer and business spending activities while increases in trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenue were driven by underlying market activity a full fourth quarter with union bank and core growth turning to slide noninterest expense as adjusted decreased by on a linked quarter basis driven by lower compensationrelated expense that was partially offset by strategic investments in marketing and business development slide highlights our credit quality performance asset quality metrics trended in line with expectations and key metrics continued to normalize to our prepandemic levels our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at december compared with at september and a year ago the fourth quarter net chargeoff ratio of increased basis points from a third quarter level of and was higher when compared to a fourth quarter level of as adjusted turning to slide we increased our common equity tier ratio to as of december the combination of earnings accretion net of distributions and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a basis point increase linked quarter balance sheet optimization activities continue to have a low to neutral impact on earnings and provided additional risk transfer benefits as we move into we expect earnings to be in the we expect earnings to be the primary driver of capital accretion with limited reliance on balance sheet capitalrelated actions as of december our common equity tier capital ratio remains above our regulatory capital minimum by basis points let me now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john ill end my prepared comments on slide was a turbulent year for the industry however we achieved a great deal including our successful conversion of union bank in late may and the realization of million in run rate cost synergies related to union bank by year end as we had targeted additionally we accomplished our goal of accelerating the accretion of cet1 capital and received full relief from category ii commitments we made in conjunction with the union bank transaction entering we are positioned to continue to deliver industryleading returns on tangible common equity are appropriately reserved for macroeconomic uncertainties and remain confident in our strategy for future growth and expansion we are seeing positive momentum across our feebased businesses as we deepen our most profitable client relationships and continue to target flat expense growth in even as we strategically invest in key areas and further execute on revenue growth opportunities with union bank let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to supporting the needs of our clients communities and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company well now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well pause for just a moment to compile the qa roster your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks everybody good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey john i was hoping you could maybe provide a little more context around the nii thoughts for the full year it sounds like if i did the math correctly were expecting somewhere between billion and billion for the full year maybe just some thoughts on how the margin and nii should traject i would presume maybe a little more downward pressure on nii given day count in the first quarter but the trough there and then sort of growth throughout the year or would there be other factors that would cause nii maybe to bleed through say middle of the year and then start to inflect back upward maybe just any thoughts there john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure good morning scott thank you maybe just to reiterate what was mentioned in the first quarter well see net interest income between billion and billion as we think about the full year for its going to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter number level of billion billion and to up slightly and were using the fourth quarter actuals really because we feel thats a more appropriate starting point given our balance sheet is now past all the capital actions that took place during the calendar year and so some of the color around that and some of the drivers related to how we are thinking about that as we we do believe that dda and low cost deposit churn into higher cost deposits are going to abate over time by the end of this quarter well be nine months past the last fed hike as an example we continue to see loan spreads improve in various categories ph led on the commercial side of things loan and investment portfolio asset churn continues to occur our loan pipelines have continued to strengthen over this quarter certainly stronger than weve seen in the past couple of quarters and we think that loan demand should be improved just given that the fed is likely going to be in a cutting mode over time and the counter to that of course is that deposit pricing is going to be competitive especially with qt running in some form in the background so ill say that first quarter nii projection is going to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter these broad factors are really going to be supportive of nii growth especially as we think about the second half of the year us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then maybe just a quick question on capital glad to hear that some of those balance sheet optimization efforts are beginning to sunset maybe one do you have what you all estimate the sort of fully loaded common equity tier ratio to be now and maybe the balance between just building and potentially returning capital going forward john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so i mean right now as you know were at on cet1 with the improvement in rates the impact of the aoci on the investment portfolio securities is about percentage points and so youre at as we think about on a fully loaded basis so if you think about it on a goforward basis were going to create capital in the area of basis points to basis points per quarter we will have a burn down on that securities book of about or so relative to where it is by the end of just to give you some context so all that kind of adds up to building our capital to where we think it needs to be for the appropriate time given regulation and the timing of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you very much john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp ph good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just maybe john following up on the nii question one sorry if i missed it what rate cut assumptions did you have in your nii outlook and then just talk to us about sensitivity are three cuts worse than six cuts just how us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 we should given market expectations around this probably is going to change weekbyweek im just trying to test the resiliency of your nii outlook if we get more or less rate cuts john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure absolutely so in terms of our current projections we have four interest rate cuts by the fed starting in the second quarter of this year now whether or not thats two cuts or six cuts its not going to be a material driver to our outlook we have worked hard to get our net interest income sensitivity to be more or less in a neutral position and so we feel like whether the cuts are how theyre positioned are not going to be a material driver to the change the outlook excuse me ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just a second question im not sure if you laid out any outlook for fee revenue growth for the year in terms of if you can just talk to in terms of what you expect overall in fee revenues and particularly on payments if you can call out expectations on what you assume for the year there thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure yeah ill call out a couple things on payments and some of the other fee categories so as we think about payments certainly in terms of merchant processing weve put a lot of investment in there theres a lot of technologyled advancements that we made in terms of connections and certainly some mub synergies and so we continue to expect highsingle digits in terms of revenue growth there the same would be said for corporate payments we think highsingle digits given the amount of te growth and client growth and all that sort of thing that we see and then on the card side of things weve seen a very nice margin expansion mub certainly helps and holiday sales have been or certainly helpful this past quarter but we see that extending and so we think midsingle digits from that standpoint i would also reiterate we had really very nice growth in the commercial product side weve had particularly in we would expect highsingle digits there given strength weve had in foreign exchange derivatives the fixed income capital markets loan syndications all been performing very well for us our trust investment management fee also should experience growth led by our institutional service businesses and corporate trust and fund services and certainly in wealth management some of the fees associated with that the one thing i would point out though in terms of service charges we have weve exited our atm cash servicing business and that was a business we decided to exit just given the high level of capital related to it in terms of intensity and investment and so that will impact us by about million to million per quarter starting in the first quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi your line is open us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi john thanks for the color so far on the guidance i guess similarly can you walk through your within the nii expectation that you provided can you walk through your expectation for loan growth for the year and how you expect that could traject i know youre citing demand weakening and then same thing on the deposit front can you maybe give us your expectation on how you think growth can look like on the on an overall basis and maybe how the net interest i mean the noninterest bearing mix could traject from here thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure so a couple of things there so ill start in the loan growth side i do believe our expectations is that we will see growth in the commercial side of course that was a little bit weaker this last quarter as we experienced pay downs particularly as clients were accessing capital markets and things of that nature but weve seen really a good pipeline build in that we expect utilization to pick up and things of that variety so we feel like that along with credit cards will be good sources of growth for us as we think about loan growth going forward on the deposit side as a reminder well probably be lower in the first quarter we seasonally lose deposits just as we kind of go through the yearend process and just given the mix of our businesses deposits end up being a little bit lower in the first quarter but then we see more or less stabilization but there might be some headwind there particularly depending on qt and how the fed draining of liquidity out of the system will impact the numbers there and then going into your nib comment weve seen of course rotation out of nib into other interestbearing products that continues but starts to wane as we go throughout the year and again as i mentioned were going to be nine months by the end of this quarter past the last fed hike and that gives us some signal that that will begin to abate john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you for that and then i guess if you could help us just think about how we should think about the magnitude of operating leverage thats reasonable as you look at next year i know we do have some color on how youre thinking about nii and fees and then put that against your efforts to keep expenses stable but i guess if you could just maybe frame it the range of operating leverage that you think is reasonable as we look at next year andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 good morning john this is andy so let me start with this and john can add on so as i said in my prepared remarks were going to benefit from the cost efficiencies of the union deal to a total of million and that is fully reflected now in the run rate starting this quarter so were achieving those benefits because of the benefits of technology investments weve made digital investments operational investments our risk platform and so that is the benefit of the investments weve made and we would expect to continue to invest in the business in those capabilities and payments and technology modernization so we are also very cognizant in managing expenses very closely we still have opportunities in terms of efficiencies in personnel in operations in activities around technology that will allow us to more efficiently deliver the services we have so i would expect as we get towards the second half of the year that when we start to see that margin growth that john talked about as well as the fee normalization that we would have opportunity for positive operating leverage and were going to again that is our longterm objective as always and we have levers to pull john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp good morning john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning i was wondering if you could give a little color on what you saw this quarter in credit quality on the npa movement particularly in commercial and then also john maybe just some thoughts on the potential chargeoff trajectory as you see things migrate from npa into chargeoffs this year what we should be thinking about thank you terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah good morning john this is terry dolan so im going to take this question related to credit quality your first one was really related to nonperforming assets and some of the things that we saw in the fourth quarter ph us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 at the end of going across the portfolio generally pretty stable we did see a couple of idiosyncratic loans that went into nonperforming status both of those were kind of union legacy sort of credits so continue to kind of work through that but i would also say that both of those are fairly well collateralized so we dont necessarily see a lot of chargeoff content related to those idiosyncratic credits when we look at net chargeoffs and the trajectory i would expect that we would expect that it will continue to kind of normalize credit card is kind of getting closer to prepandemic levels but that will continue to move up a little bit our expectation is that for full year well probably be in kind of in the mid in terms of the net chargeoff rate john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks terry and then john or andy just on the fee revenues john ticked off on the fee revenues a number of highsingle digit kind of potential growers in how do we think about kind of the ability to grow total fee revenues and what kind of base should we use for that it looks like maybe the adjusted base for was about billion of fee revenues is that something you can grow off of that just trying to contextualize total revenue last year was around billion how should we think about the ability to grow revenues on fees and maybe total revenues this year john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so i mean we had as you mentioned some of the fee numbers there from a core fee perspective we do expect to grow i ticked off some of the areas in terms of payments commercial products trust and all that sort of thing other and some of the service charges components there of course in terms of mortgage that will be probably somewhat on the flat range and in terms of other we had a little bit of a high number in terms of the fourth quarter related to tax credit related impact finance syndication fees and things like that so all those things and we expect kind of that midsingle in terms of the fee components going forward for this year john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay kind of a midsingle from that billion adjusted base john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp yes john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good morning my first question is for you andy clearly you went through it in terms of some capital ph consternation and now youre sitting here with cet1 no longer have to be a category ii bank early and all the color that were getting from washington is that basel iii endgame will be at least delayed if not softened significantly as you think about maybe just one more hurdle ahead over the nearterm in terms of the dfast how are you thinking about where usbs proper cet1 ratio is in terms of the minimum looking forward to a future where maybe capital is a little bit tighter but youre also growing and do you feel like youre now on offense and all the sort of balance sheet management that was designed to optimize capital is fully behind you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah erika as john mentioned i think our balance sheet optimization efforts are behind us our focus on capital accretion will be from earnings as we go into and forward as we talked about were at a cet1 ratio today a couple of years ago our target was between and so were above that target but were also cognizant of the rules that are coming both from the perspective of basel iii endgame which is still uncertain as you talked about as well as ccar and how that will evolve over time so we will continue to accrete ph to well continue to burn down the aoci when we get clarity on the capital rules both basel iii and ccar well then determine what the proper capital target will be my expectation is well be above the that we were a few years ago but well define that refine that and then well get into what the math is around buybacks at that time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and one followup question for you john thank you for giving us some of the components of the nii im just wondering as you mentioned qt are you generally expecting deposits to be down total deposits to be down even if dda mix shift abates and also how quickly do you think the deposit betas on the way down can react to each fed rate cut john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure so the first part of your question in terms of qt we do anticipate qt to be throughout the year and so thats going to on whole put pressure on deposits throughout the year in terms of balances and so we dont expect a lot of growth overall in deposits but well we have ways to manage through that of course theyre talking through various ways to change the qt but that just remains to be seen us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 in terms of deposits performance on the way down i would anticipate commercial and wholesale type balances will go down just as fast as they would come up on the retail side its going to be more of an arc itll take some time for that to turn but those are our expectations erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so i wasnt clear are you guiding for flat positive or negative operating leverage or none of the above for and more generally i mean the real question is when do you get back to your historical efficiency ratio i think you talked about this at a presentation in december i mean core efficiency in the fourth quarter isnt exactly like legacy us bancorp and thats up basis points yearoveryear and earlier last decade you were and going back further you were in the low is that just a aspirational target now or is there a real target over the next two years or so and along those lines i guess you have all the savings youre going to get from union bank so where does the rest come from here andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike its probably more likely a positive operating leverage in the second half of versus the first half given some of the margin pressures that we talked about that is still our objective my expectation is once we get more to our normalized revenue level that we will continue to manage expenses below revenue growth and continue to tick down that efficiency ratios into the thats the way were planning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc when you say into the i mean is it can you get back to is that in your planning horizon even going out a few more years and it looks like the payments business is recatching its stride here and along those lines i didnt see the slide anymore on the payments business combined with small business banking youre going to grow small business relationships by to and the revenues by to i dont see any slide for that and i know youve got look youve got union bank deal you had the issues of last march and april and its okay your capital is back the deal is done and now were back to kind of us bancorp business as usual so im just trying to look for some color on that if youre going to become the square of banking or if thats still a goal and how those revenues might help you improve that efficiency andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 sure mike and it is still a goal we do think this combination of payments and business banking and providing that comprehensive product set and capabilities to help people run their business is a key strategic priority and continues to be and i think the fee categories that john mentioned are also a key driver of revenue including payments commercial products trust and investment and those are all areas that we expect continued growth on the immediate pressure on net interest income is whats causing us not to get positive operating leverage in the shortterm but it is something that i believe and as john mentioned will abate and start to grow into the second half of and so i think were going to get to the positive operating leverage we are planning on it and we will continue to drive that efficiency ratio down certainly into the high at the beginning and continue to deliver positive operating leverage to get it even lower thats our objective mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning just to clarify the flat expense guidance for is off of the adjusted level of of ph andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thats correct john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and i assume that includes any expense benefit from the exit of the atm cash business that you referenced earlier us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp correct john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp yes matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just stepping back like any other kind of small businesses or segments that youre kind of the reevaluating for not so much kind of the regulatory proposals which well see how they finalize but just other areas that youre stepping back and whether its in mortgage ph getting a smaller market there or other parts of the business portfolio that youre looking either to exit or to potentially lean into thats a bit different than you were thinking say six months ago john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp i can start and andy can chime in i think weve commented on the atm business i mean youre constantly evaluating certain things particularly in light of regulatory change clearly a lot of comment letters have been submitted in terms of the basel iii endgame at the end of the day its not going to materially drive whether we exit or businesses or enter new businesses that sort of thing its just going to be a combination of continual investment as andy mentioned in terms of what we need to do toward achieving positive operating leverage and managing around regulatory actions those are some of the comments id throw out there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think i agree john and the only thing id add is the environment and the competitive dynamic is something that causes us to be more aggressive or less aggressive in certain categories maybe an example ill give you is auto lending which is for us is not growing right now and thats because of the spreads and the returns are just not at our levels that we want to put on the books so those are areas that were going to not get out of or close down but just not emphasize in terms of growth at the levels of returns that were seeing right now matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then historically in credit card were obviously seeing a normalization of losses with you guys and throughout the industry and also very strong growth so if we adjust losses kind of on a lagged basis they are above a few years ago at what point do you tighten up credit card and say we should slow growth at this point in the cycle or do you think there is still quite a bit of runway of call it good growth or healthy growth terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah well i mean it is an area matt that we think there continues to be nice growth in that particular space it is an area though that certainly as we have looked at the economic uncertainties and those sorts of things the pressure on consumers especially given the inflationary sort of pressure we on the margin around the edges we do make adjustments to underwriting and tighten that up where we need to but when you end up kind of us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 thinking about the overall credit performance of credit card business we still think its a very nice business we focus on prime super prime sort of customers and even through this cycle i think its going to perform very well matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning andy good morning john andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john you touched on in answering a question about commercial loan growth that some of your customers were accessing the capital markets and things of that nature can you guys share with us we read a lot and see a lot about the private credit markets have really become quite active and aggressive in making loans to corporate and commercial customers are you guys seeing that competition number one and also is it any different than past years or has it intensified and then simultaneously are any of these private apollo blackstone et cetera are these customers of yours and if they are how do you balance the competition versus handling their needs john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure this is john gerard so in terms of on the commercial side when i comment that going to the capital markets is more or less the public markets so taking bond issuance to in the public investmentgrade market we tend not to see them or compete on the private credit side of things its just not a structure or type of loan type in terms of our client base that we tend to run into so its more or less i cant say its increased or decreased versus because we just dont see those names we compete in the commercial space with our peer banks more or less in that particular venue in terms of you mentioned in terms of client interaction we have great relationships with a number of different names in terms of investment services capital markets activities other sorts of categories so we do have some very nice relationships with those institutions us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah our corporate trust and global fund services gerard as john mentioned businesses they support a number of large private credit funds in the industry and they are customers and clients of ours that we continue to serve gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp i think the last thing i would just add is that depending upon where the capital rules end up and what sort of where the emphasis is or isnt you could see more or less moving into the private capital sort of markets they tend to have more flexibility in terms of structure they take on more risk all sorts of things again it may not be where we compete but certainly from an industry standpoint private credit continues to be an area of focus gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you terry just if we step back for a moment and look at beyond basel iii endgame maybe we do get the final proposal in the middle of this year or later this year we get through the next dfast us bancorp has always had a hallmark of having one of the highest rotces amongst the regional banks obviously youre probably going to maintain that but you also were very disciplined in giving back the excess capital every year to shareholders in buybacks and dividends generally if i recall correctly around to of total earnings in a combination of both andy do you see that coming on the horizon maybe once we get all the rules set and you know what your cet1 ratio needs to be whats your outlook there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah gerard we do achieve a high return on tangible common i mentioned to fourth quarter versus full year of and as we think about going forward i would expect us to continue to lead the pack in terms of that return which is key to generating capital to key to returning capital and again once we get clarity on the rules as i mentioned earlier in both the basel iii endgame as well as the ccar process and determine our target capital levels we will return the difference either through dividends or buybacks ph has been our history gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is open us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning just to followup on the deposit side you mentioned in your prepared remarks about starting to moderate pricing a little bit and you also talked about rolloff of higher cost deposits just wondering if you can amplify both of those comments so what types of products or tweaks are you already being able to make on the deposit pricing front and then where did those highercost deposits flow out of from a business perspective thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure thanks ken the comment was really around in terms of the fourth quarter and just what we saw maybe just stepping back a bit in the third quarter we grew deposits quite a bit and part of that was we were just getting through the union bank acquisition we wanted to make sure we were maintaining strong relationships with those clients and really all clients as we were going through those times in the fourth quarter given where loan demand went and where we had a little bit of excess of deposits so we made decisions really just tactically to go away from nondeposits or nonrelationship or less relationship based and specifically on time deposits declining and things of that nature so i think thats just going to be the ebb and flow of things of just how we manage it going forward depending on loan growth depending on our profile and depending on the relationship so thats really what that comment was intended for andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and importantly john on our core consumer deposits we are continuing to see growth there as you mentioned thats what we had in the slide john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp yep we continue to expect core deposit growth in the consumer side and that has been something that the team has been very focused on and we feel weve had great success there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and as a followup to the ub point is everything from ub now fully baked whether its the cost actions and structure and also thats kind of making sure youre buttoned up as a starting point has that base of loans and deposits gotten to a steady state as well andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so we just move forward with everything and listen to the guide comments that you gave earlier okay got it thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp exactly its all in the core now yes operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with hsbc your line is open saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hey good morning guys john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp good morning saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc maybe on the payments side can you just add a little bit more detail about how youre feeling about your payments strategy and how youre doing and how big the upside opportunity is there obviously youre growing nicely on the issuing side the merchant acquiring side sort of midsingle digit growth in revenues and volumes i think you said highsingle digit next year i mean as you guys know the banks have ceded a lot of share to software companies integrated service providers and just how do you feel its going in terms of integrating your commercial banking and payments offering and it does seem like you have a major advantage in terms of having relationships both on the retail and commercial side and obviously you kind of have that twosided network that a lot of the fintechs want but obviously banks have struggled in this area so just maybe if you can just give us sort of an overview of how youre doing and how you feel the opportunity set is evolving andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah saul so first of all the highsingle digits on merchant processing is a function of the investments weve made and the initiatives we have underway and i would highlight two things number one is our techled initiative which is now up over of our activities related to techled so that is integrating our merchant processing capabilities into the software that people use to run their businesses and number two is this whole integration of banking and payments that weve talked about earlier and the advantage i do believe that we have is that we are not just providing one single service were integrating banking services deposit lending capabilities treasury management together with payments and money movement into one comprehensive offering that helps people again run their business particularly small businesses and helps them ease into the process of payments activity in a comprehensive way together with the software theyre using to run their company so those are the initiatives that we have underway and that continues to be a huge focus and one that i do think differentiates us a little bit because of the capabilities we have in payments and thats true of merchant processing corporate payments as well as retail issuing us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2024 saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay got it thats helpful maybe ill just follow up on deposits you mentioned the migration you expect the migration out of noninterest bearing deposits to sort of run its course just when and where do you see that i think noninterest bearing was of total deposits how much more room is there and just on deposit cost i think the cumulative beta if my calculation is right is around how much more room is there for that to increase or whats embedded in your guidance for nii john c stern a senior executive vice president and chief financial officer us bancorp sure so in terms of the nib i think weve talked quite a bit about it and i would just i mean were at a certain percentage that you mentioned and were going to be around that area it certainly could drift a little lower but we are at a point where from a core standpoint particularly on the commercial and small business side where youre starting to get into places where companies have to run operating accounts and over time youre going to have account growth and things of that variety so i think theyll be conducive to supporting nib going forward but there will be some leftover churn as i alluded to earlier in the call in terms of beta as you mentioned or so percent is our beta right now i think it can creep up as weve kind of talked about but its going to depend on when the fed cuts is going to be kind of that focus point in terms of how much it will go from here and so how what level is hard to predict but there will be pressure until the fed starts cutting saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay got it thanks operator there are no further questions at this time mr andersen ill turn the
