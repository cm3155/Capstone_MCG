it over to neal to cover our financial results in greater detail were really pleased with our strategic and tactical accomplishments in the quarter ill hit the highlights and neal will provide more details we grew deposits in the quarter including growth in dda overall commercial deposits and hsa we grew loans in the quarter consistent with our full year growth expectations excluding a million securitization we performed to reduce our cre concentration our growth was in the quarter with accelerating growth in ci categories we further reduced our cre concentration through payoffs and reclassification of certain healthcarerelated loans as a result our cre outstanding as a percentage of tier capital and reserves declined from to approximately at the end of q3 our net interest income grew quarteroverquarter and increased over last years comparable period in line with our full year expectations we benefited from asset growth and a balance sheet repositioning we continue to mitigate our asset sensitivity positioning us well as rates continue to come down our capital levels remained strong with our cet1 now in excess of our current operating target of resulting from earnings and capital optimization activities providing us capital flexibility in and beyond our expenses remained wellmanaged resulting in a third quarter efficiency ratio of still in an industryleading position ill now turn to our financial performance for the quarter beginning on slide on an adjusted basis for the quarter we generated a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of our adjusted eps was a our profitability and return metrics remain favorable to peers again this quarter at this point most of you are familiar with slide which illustrates our diverse and versatile deposit base as i mentioned upfront our robust growth this period came from a breadth of the segments on the slide including lower cost channels in our commercial bank hsa bank and ametros we executed on the million deposit opportunity for hsa bank we discussed last quarter which provided a nice boost to deposits there strong execution within the commercial bank added to lower cost funding growth as well our ability to generate low cost funding across a number of business segments continues to be a tremendous advantage in growing our balance sheet efficiently and profitably moving to slide i will review our commercial real estate portfolio as that has been a continued focus of investors the segment of the cre portfolio on which we have been most focused continues to be traditional office the portfolio balance continues to shrink with million in outstandings at quarter end down roughly from the first half of we did see some continued negative migration this quarter with nonaccrual loans decreasing to from last quarter largely as a result of two larger credits webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 we continue to be proactive in identifying and managing problem credits and prudently managing reserves in the sector while theres been an investor focus there have been no significant changes in the quality of our rent regulated multifamily portfolio where credit performance has held up consistently well on credit more generally we continue to see negative risk rating migration in the quarter as we keep a close eye on credit at a later stage in the cycle we did see our nonaccrual loans increased by million this quarter primarily driven by the aforementioned office portfolio migration outside of cre office negative migration was generally credit specific across the portfolio and not driven by one industry sector or asset class or the healthcare related portfolios continue to show some weakness while we have seen continued migration and well continue to be proactive in our risk reviews our realization of loan losses remains in the range we have observed in recent quarters and importantly is consistent with through thecycle and prepandemic commercial annualized chargeoff rates with that ill turn it over to neal to cover our financials in more detail william neal holland chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap and adjusted earnings for the quarter on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and diluted eps of adjustments consisted of a pretax million securities repositioning charge a million impact from the exit of noncore factoring operations and a million of strategic restructuring costs turning to slide total assets were billion at periodend up billion from the second quarter mirrored by robust deposit growth of billion deposit growth was aided by a seasonal surge in public funds of billion as a result of the substantial deposit growth we are holding higher cash balances than we have historically we also exhibited solid loan growth of excluding the securitization the loantodeposit ratio was tangible book value increased to per common share with the increase from the prior quarter driven by retained earnings and positive movement in aoci due to the low rate environment capital levels improved significantly the common equity tier ratio was up basis points linkedquarter and our tangible common equity ratio was in addition to internal capital generation the tce ratio benefited from the improvement in aoci the common equity tier ratio also benefited from several actions we undertook to optimize asset risk weighting as well as the securitization in total these actions added basis points to our common equity tier ratio loan trends are highlighted on slide in total loans were up million or linked quarter excluding cre other loan categories grew by this quarter commercial real estate balances were down million as we experience some natural attrition in addition to the securitization this accelerates our path to our target of of capital plus reserves the securitization creating capacity and adds and allows us to add commercial real estate relationships with attractive riskreward characteristics the yield on the portfolio was flat given the mix of new loan originations and repricing of floating rate loans on the september fed move we provide additional details on deposits on slide we grew total deposits by billion with diverse growth across categories the pace was accelerated this quarter due to seasonal inflows of public deposits and a discrete opportunity with a hsa bank that added webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 million of lowcost deposits dda balances increased by over million this quarter with the majority of the increase coming from seasonal effects however it is still encouraging to see normalization in the dda balances after several quarters of declines moving to slide net interest income was up million from the prior quarter driven by balance sheet growth and higher earning asset yields adjusted noninterest income was up million adjusted expenses were up million and the provision decreased by million excluding adjustments our tax rate was overall adjusted net income was up million relative to the prior quarter our efficiency ratio was on slide we highlight net interest income which increased million or linked quarter driven by balance sheet growth and the increased earning asset yield the net interest margin was up basis points to our yield on earning assets increased basis points over the prior quarter with loan yields flat and the securities portfolio up basis points in the third quarter we incrementally sold securities with a book value of million and reinvested with an approximate basis point improvement in yields with minimal impact to capital ratios we anticipate an earnback of less than two years our net we were able to maintain our total deposit cost effectively flat for the quarter slide illustrates the progress webster has made in mitigating its asset sensitivity over the past three years by increasing the duration of our assets and reducing the duration of our liabilities on slide is noninterest income which was up million versus prior quarter on an adjusted basis adjusted income included both a million negative cva and million gain on the securitization we continue to experience pressure on core fee growth yearoveryear fees are up million including the impact of ametros acquisition offset by yearoveryear changes in cva noninterest expense is on slide we reported adjusted expenses of million up million for the prior quarter driven by modest increases in technology human capital and occupancy costs slide details components of our allowance for credit losses which was up million relative to the prior quarter after booking million in net chargeoffs we recorded million provision primarily due to credit factors as a result our allowance coverage to loan increased to a basis points from a basis points last quarter slide highlights our key asset quality metrics as you can see on the four charts we saw continued migration in the quarter net chargeoffs came in at million versus million in the prior quarter on slide we enhanced our already strong capital levels as we noted previously we took several actions to improve our capital ratios in the quarter including reviewing the risk weighting of our multifamily lender finance and public sector portfolios as well as the securitization of multifamily loans these actions in combination with organic capital generation and lower aoci losses led to a significant increase in our capital ratios this quarter i will wrap up my comments on slide with our outlook for the fourth quarter we expect loans to grow by to with growth across the diverse categories including the potential for some modest growth in commercial real estate we are anticipating deposits will decline by around as seasonality in the public funds business leads to outflows webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 we expect net interest income in the range of million to million on a nonfte basis this is within the guidance range we provided on the second quarter earnings call our net interest income outlook assumes basis points of cuts in the first fourth quarter with basis points each in november and december adjusted noninterest income will be million to million we anticipate adjusted expenses will be in the range of million with an efficiency ratio in the mid our nearterm common equity tier ratio remains with that ill turn it back to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks neal im anticipating will receive questions on our priorities for capital allocation given the sharp increase in our capital ratios in the quarter while we continue to prioritize funding organic balance sheet growth and complementary tuckin acquisitions our capacity to return capital to shareholders has increased since the second quarter and we will be prudent and proactive managers of capital we are wellpositioned to maintain our profitability profile as neal detailed we have proactively managed our balance sheet over the past year to ensure stable net interest income in a declining interest rate environment both in terms of managing our funding costs and tweaking the profile of our earning assets we have capacity and capability to grow our balance sheet via the diversified mix of loan and deposit categories while at the same time maintaining flexibility on capital allocation and our efficiency ratio remains among the best of our peers we have retained superior profitability even as we invest in people processes and technology on the latter over the last months we have made significant investments to strengthen our technology foundation including the modernization of our core banking platform building advanced bsa aml competencies and heightening our cybersecurity and cloud capabilities finally id like to thank our colleagues for their continued effort their hard work is reflected in our performance this quarter particularly in our strong deposit growth in favorable categories thank you again for joining us today operator we will open the line to questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe john or neal the actions you took with the balance sheet obviously set up for a better more neutrally positioned balance sheet going into how do we think about i guess trough nii is q4 the trough how are you thinking about it given you freed up a little bit of space on the balance sheet yeah maybe ill leave it there william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so we came in at for the quarter as you look at how we exited q3 were going to be holding a little bit more cash on the balance sheet which in q4 will have a slight drag to nim so were kind of in the q4 are going to be in range and having that exit velocity in the next year and then kind of staying right in that level into is how we think about nim so we think were at a stable nim we may be at plus or minus basis points as we move forward but thats the range were looking at going forward into christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect and then my followup john you alluded to the capital return flexibility could you maybe just rank order and also the timing of what you think you might be able to return more capital john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean i think we always talk about kind of prioritizing for organic balance sheet growth thinking about doing things like weve done with ametros and interlink and bend and then obviously if theres no other productive use of capital i do think given where we are and the fact that we do think with interest rates coming down that we should see an inflection point in credit as we get into this quarter in the first half of that were more likely to begin repurchases again absent other organic opportunities to deploy that capital chris so i think were there we feel really good about our capital levels now and we have some more flexibility so were more likely than we were before in the next quarter or two to begin share repurchases absent other uses of organic deployment webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc looking at maybe loan growth as we exit going into how much additional attritional headwind should we expect from cre it sort of sounds like maybe not that much but and should we expect or anticipate that maybe the overall loan growth rate starts to accelerate as we exit the year going into john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean its a great question right loan growth has clearly been muted for the industry in the last couple of quarters we did have a really good quarter in many core ci categories and i will say that that sort of pull through has continued early on in this quarter although we know that the fourth quarter is also subject to significant prepayments and theres a lot of activity particularly on transactional sponsor and specialty deals so thats why we didnt really change our guidance for the fourth quarter i think youve heard me say and for years or so weve been able to kind of grow commercial categories in the high single digits to around i think right now our view of jared is that we see theres continued kind of modest loan demand so i think right now we think about next year as a 5ish kind of loan growth were going to give formal guidance when we get into the january call could we outperform that sure i think ive always said i think we can kind of perform at or better than whatever the market allows but i think if you read what others are saying and we look kind of at activity i think may not be a blowout year but be more modest and similar to this year with respect to loan growth with respect to your question about mix and commercial real estate obviously were really pleased this quarter and i think theres a bit of a template there for us we had significant organic prepayments which i know many others in the industry have reported over the last couple of quarters in cre and then we did the securitization which actually was economically beneficial to us in terms of the gain on the transaction and we look at that not as just trying to drive down cre balances as much as we can but it gives us capacity to support our really good clients and in full relationships were really good at it and so you will see some level of origination there and then at the end of the day as we grow our capital base and we grow our other ci classes youll see either flat to modest growth overall in cre with our ability to maybe exit nonstrategic cre relationships but i think we showed this quarter we can still grow loans at market while not relying on outsized cre growth webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc thats great color thanks and then maybe for my followup on the deposit side really good trends there yeah as were entering the enrollment season what are your thoughts on maybe audio gap luis massiani a president chief operating officer webster financial corp yeah hey jared its luis we feel good jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc or do you think that there could be some pressures or opportunity luis massiani a president chief operating officer webster financial corp hello hey jared its luis so we do see weve seen pretty good early indicators that the enrollment season is going to be as good as weve seen in the recent couple of years so weve made a fair amount of investments in bunch of clientfacing technology we launched the new investment management platform that you may have seen we rolled out earlier this year and so we feel very good about the investments and how weve positioned the and continue to position the hsa business and we think that youre going to see similar to slightly more faster deposit growth in relative to what we saw this year so we feel good about where hsa is today john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp and jared as we usually do in january well be able to give you a kind of a first look at new business and what we anticipate and then obviously at the end of the first quarter we kind of can final tally whats come in but i agree with luis i think it was a good selling season for hsa luis massiani a president chief operating officer webster financial corp yeah jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks a lot john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler your line is open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp hey mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co john the real deal published an article late last week suggesting that you guys have two large office loans in new jersey that are in default to the tune of about million i guess im wondering are these on nonaccrual in the third quarter and do you have any specific reserves against them john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks for the question mark yeah so both of those loans and let me make a couple comments obviously with a billion loan book we dont generally comment on specific relationships single point exposures litigation and so on and so forth but obviously this has become a bit public so what i will tell you is the highlight numbers there are significantly overstate websters exposure those were two loans originated premerger one has a webster exposure under million the other one is webster exposure under million both of those loans are on nonaccrual at the end of the third quarter both of those loans have obviously been reviewed and there have been the appropriate chargeoffs and specific reserves put against those loans as i mentioned in my early comments two office loans drove the significant or not that what the increase was in nonperformers in the quarter those were the two loans and we took chargeoffs that that contributed to the overall million charge in the quarter so thats what ill tell you office chargeoffs were of the chargeoffs in our quarter so you can kind of triangulate from there but were pretty good about making sure that we are proactively managing things that things go nonperformer when theyre supposed to go and taking charges that were supposed to take and so the good thing about being a company our size right now is weve got significant earnings power weve got a very high loan loss reserve compared to our peer median and so this quarter it really didnt have an impact on our overall financial performance and we feel pretty good that weve got enough reserves in not only those two loans but in our overall cre portfolio that we continue to work down to not have there be a material financial impact as we move forward mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay thats great and then just as a followup john you guys have done a great job shrinking the office book i guess i wondered if you could share with us what the reserve on the office portfolio is right now john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think its a mark ill give you again ill repeat what i said jason had talked to me when the portfolio was billion a quarter or so ago we talked about there being about a third of that which is kind of handtohand combat that were working through these two credits that i just referenced and that you asked webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 about were obviously in that kind of third of difficult working through weve got about a third of the portfolio that we dont worry about thats highly leased that has longdated maturities and then the stuff in the middle we continue to kind of just actively manage and we think weve got enough secondary and tertiary support as well as inplace leases to kind of work through so when you think about on the overall million thats left remember there are some specific reserves as well and when you think about the reserving we feel comfortable about it because its really against that onethird of the portfolio thats most problematic for us mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you mark operator your next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everybody john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i was hoping you could talk a little bit about expectations around loan and deposit betas over the next year or so whether or not youve had any early success tweaking and lowering deposit costs if so where and then the other side of the coin is just given over the quarters youve reduced asset sensitivity whether or not you think fullcycle loan beta will match what weve seen during the heightened cycle which was kind of in the low50 range william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah ill jump in there i think obviously we had our first cut in the cycle of basis points and we took pretty quick action on the deposit portfolio and weve repriced down billion billion of that portfolio at about of our deposit portfolio at about a beta so its kind of billion and beta or if you look at our total book about beta so far our interlinked deposits basically almost immediate beta and those are over billion we saw some nice pricing down in our commercial deposit portfolio beta so far on our online portfolio with brio and then a bunch of different moves that our consumer portfolio through the first cut so were feeling pretty good there as you take a step back and look at our overall portfolio within the next year we expect approximately billion of webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 our loans and securities in cash to reprice thats billion in loans and billion in securities so our securities book is fixed and long with less than billion out of our billion portfolio there or variable so we kind of look at that as the repricing side on the loans and if you flip to the deposit side in the first five quarters of the upcycle with beta and were anticipating approximately basis a beta of in the first five quarters down and if you think about it beta on a billion portfolio you do the quick math there thats about billion to billion and a beta we have short borrowings billion out of billion will mature this quarter and next weve got a billion hedge portfolio that helps support our current positioning and then theres another large factor for us is that we have approximately billion of fixed rate securities that mature and churn annually and those are anticipated to rollover rolloff at about and roll back on with new originations in the range so basis points or so up so when you kind of put all that together we have a pretty wellbalanced position going into next year and as you can see in our model results a very neutral positioning despite us having a fairly large portion of variable rate load so a long answer there but i know its an important topic and i think that the team has done a really good job positioning us for this down rate environment matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i appreciate all that thank you and the followup is just on expenses expectations around expense growth over the next year or so specifically as it relates to preparation for billion should we expect any acceleration in the coming quarters or year in expense growth as you get ready for this and what areas do you expect to address as you kind of piece out infrastructure thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah matt thank you for the question and this may leave you a little wanting for more but as we said were finishing up right now with pwc our gaap analysis and our plan for our march to category i always remind you that were three years to four years away from an organic growth perspective in hitting the billion category and as we mentioned before there will be additional expense for us to get there in terms of hiring people and building out reporting capabilities and technology and obviously the expense of indiscernible and were going through right now kind of a cadence of running that through and our plan is as i mentioned last quarter that in january when we give our guidance that will include kind of our fully loaded assumptions about what that means for expenses i also remind you that we have the three years to four years to spread those expenses out and you heard neal mention earlier for example that we took some charges on severance and reorganization in the quarter and a lot of those moves in terms of exiting noncore businesses and looking at our organization will free up dollars to invest so as we move forward youre going to get the answer to the question in january in our guidance we think that that will put additional pressure on our expenses but it wont be material we still feel very confident in our ability to deliver outsized returns as we go through this process and so neal i dont know if you want to put a little bit of more flavor around that but william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 yeah i think you said that well john one of my initial concerns coming into the organization was hey were running at a efficiency ratio are there really opportunities to find more efficiency and as john mentioned the team have done a nice job putting together a small program and with the restructuring charges we took this quarter we expect our expense run rate next year to drop million which wont flow all to the bottom line well use some of those dollars to reinvest and prepare for category so i think its an example of how we can continue to find efficiencies to pave our way to that kind of the requirements and as john mentioned well talk about specific numbers in q1 but if you take a step back we have an expense base thats just over billion so of that is million if you add to our expense growth rate over the next four years that probably hits a good chunk of what we need to build im not saying that thats whats going to happen but just kind of highlighting that it should be some incremental around the edges on the expense side versus a kind of a big popup of onetime expenses is the current view but as john mentioned were not fully through the analysis and preparation and were making good progress there and well get more details in q1 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i appreciate all that thank you thats all i have john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you matt operator your next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james your line is open daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc i guess first just a followup on the credit side john i think you mentioned an inflection in credit could lead to the possibility for increased repurchases going forward but how should we think about that do you think that nonaccruals are at or nearing a peak here obviously theres some uncertainty with how the whole office loan environment plays out but just curious how we should be thinking about those nonaccrual and kind of early stage credit levels and how that plays into your thinking on net chargeoffs as well john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its a terrific question and one that i loathe answering just because it is difficult to predict we mentioned last quarter that this quarter would be less worse if you were and if we were marginally less worse weve been through the entire portfolio we are getting to a point where i think weve identified obviously all proactively all the real issues in the portfolio that we go through and i again remind everybody that if you look at our absolute webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 statistics theyre kind of still in line with prepandemic statistics so i know a lot of ceos are saying were trying to remind everybody that this hasnt been a cratering of credit its been sort of a return to normalcy on credit our hope right now and what were looking at is weve got interest rates coming down weve already seen an increase in commercial real estate refinancing activity based on the behavior of the fiveyear and the forward curve and so as interest rates come down if the fed navigates this soft landing i do think that we should see running through bank pls and bank balance sheets an inflection in credit certainly in the first half of its tough to call a particular quarter we have seen some negative risk rating migrations weve been pleased that that migration has not continued to result in higher levels of annualized chargeoffs and so it would be difficult for me to say hey we think is the bottom but i do think all the macro factors and our understanding of our portfolio that the first half of we should start to see kind of absolute improvement in the balance sheet and obviously we have a forward look based where were trading if youre asking the question with respect to capital allocation and return of capital weve got lots of earnings weve got really good reserves so well put that all into the box and decide whether or not in the fourth quarter we start buybacks or whether or not thats the first half of activity daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay terrific thanks for all that color and then changing gears here just looking at loan growth the loan growth side you talked about how the fourth quarter could be impacted by some slower perhaps ci and sponsor with the headwinds you mentioned specifically for prepayments but just curious the pace of growth in the third quarter what you saw there if that picked up near the end of the quarter if it was relatively steady and then just also curious on the residential side expectations for how much youre going to be adding to the portfolio relative to the other sides of the house thanks john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah our primary focus is continuing to grow a myriad of ci categories i would say that the loan behaviors in the third quarter interestingly that growth if you take out the securitization it was sort of more back ended if you will in the quarter which gives us some momentum on nii as we go into q4 and as ive said weve continued to see pull through in the early in the fourth quarter the reason we didnt up the guidance is because we know theres a lot of activity both on origination and prepayments in the quarter and we dont really have full visibility yet i think we still have pressure on our sponsor and specialty business from the proliferation of private credit were going to have our asset manager program hopefully up and running in the first quarter which should give us some additional momentum there our middle market performed well our public sector finance performed well weve got other levers to pull in assetbased lending and in equipment finance so i think with our portfolio well continue to be able to grow ci categories youll probably see some level as neal mentioned of modest growth in commercial real estate because right now if youre good at it and you can get really nice riskreward because there are fewer players in the market and then i think well sort of fill in with our mortgage originations obviously serving our customers in our market and then some level of correspondent mortgage origination so i would say its balanced and on balance we still think that kind of if 5ish annualized loan growth is the right number webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thanks for all that color operator your next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank your line is open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank hey guys good morning so on page of the deck you noted that youve identified and documented certain loans eligible to optimize rwa treatment and i know youve been talking about this on the call but just to elaborate a bit more on these actions and if you could size how big this was to capital improvement during the quarter william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so i think all of our actions in total were about basis points to the quarter we really went in and did deep dives into our multifamily lender finance and public sector portfolios and looked at the risk weighting ill give you an example kind of in the public sector we have a lot of loans sitting at risk weighting and general obligation bonds can be a and revenue pledge at so we did a lot of work to pull additional data and really optimize our risk weighting there thats one example across the categories so hopefully that and then the as we mentioned that securitization also helped drive increased capital levels and that was about basis points included in that basis points that i just mentioned bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank okay thats helpful william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp great bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank and then on expenses obviously with technology you basically highlighted youve been making these significant investments in the tech stack modernizing the core banking platform the bsa aml cybersecurity cloud capabilities during the quarter you also highlighted the tech spend increase sequentially of professional services and occupancy costs can you just provide some color on those for the quarter on the tech professional and occupancy luis massiani a president chief operating officer webster financial corp specific bernard your question mean like specific expenses related to those initiatives for the quarter or webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank yeah luis massiani a president chief operating officer webster financial corp yeah we dont really think about it that way i think that this is every year we look at a rolling threeyear technology roadmap and investment initiatives and everything that you highlighted there and that weve highlighted in the specific items that you were talking about are part of the longterm strategies that weve been deploying so there is nothing really new there that we would isolate as something thats going to be recurring longterm in nature and neal alluded to what we expect expenses are going to be and kind of with the progression of those are going to be in the and all that estimated projection includes everything that we think is going to be required to continue to modernize the tech stack build out the tech stack invest in the various business lines invest in risk management platforms and so all its all inclusive when we provide that guidance for and we dont envision that theres going to be any outsized tech spend in relative to what youve seen this year so we feel again we feel pretty good about where our tech longterm technology roadmap is and we have a clear path to making the investments in specific areas to support client experience while at the same time building out risk in operating platforms bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank okay great

your book and youve been very proactive and transparent but on your million of loan loss provisions that you took this quarter how much of that was office and then of the two loans that are new on nonperforming thats million and million can you help us think a little bit about what is the occupancy whats the new debt service there and then specific reserves on those two loans certainly under the backdrop that you gave mark office reserves are or million basically of your million what are the specific reserves on those two loans and then just sort of final question here on office specifically that million exposure that bankwell just filed theyre a part of it and you guys it looks like where the lead ie sterling was the lead can you just help us think about again this is just per the bankwell filing that there was a refresh property appraisal done in april at million and then five months later that property is now worth million so if you could just help us think through any parts of that that would be really helpful thanks john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah laurie i dont think first of all i dont have all of that information and i dont think i can give you very good answers there i mean ill tell you with respect to cecl and the provisioning for the quarter there are so many inandouts right that theres you cant identify the amount of the provision related to a specific credit or even to a specific portfolio because what youre doing is refreshing and updating your risk ratings along with your qualitative factors and youre coming up with a refreshed life of loan losses for a billion portfolio so certainly the amount of chargeoffs impacts what you provide but it doesnt necessarily immediately correlate with where the chargeoffs came from so i dont think i can draw a connection to those two loans to our provision i gave you the fact that the chargeoffs in the quarter about of the chargeoffs were related to office loans those loans we mentioned being the largest drivers we actually had net recoveries in consumer which offset our overall chargeoffs a little bit so again its tough to draw those conclusions i certainly dont have the inplace debt service coverage and ltvs on those two specific loans now what i can tell you from the ceo seat is that if theyre on nonaccrual it means that there is a question as to whether or not the underlying cash flows can repay the loan as agreed so we might be able to get you some of that offline with emlen and jason but i cant give you the specifics on those two transactions we were the lead lender youre correct it was i think a or origination significantly premerger so i can tell you that we were the agent on those two credits and i think thats the information that i have available to me here laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc okay okay and then my followup question just switching gears when in the quarter did the securities restructuring occur and then finally do you have a september spot margin thanks for taking my questions william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 yeah ill jump in with the september spot margin so september was a little bit lower we were about loans came down basis points and deposits basis points ill caveat that by saying monthly nim is a little bit more variable than quarterly nim ill also say that september nim really represents our repricing dynamics sofr started moving down well before the fed cuts and theres obviously some lag there with our deposits repricing later with the cut coming in the middle of the month we also started holding higher levels of cash in september so since midseptember as i mentioned before weve taken significant action on our deposit costs that beta already and we are confident that our q4 nim will come in above our september spot number yes i think that and in the transaction there was kind of a it happens throughout the quarter but probably weighted average more to the middle of the quarter john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you laurie operator your next question comes from the line of samuel varga with ubs your line is open samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning just wanted to go back to the securities book and you commented on the rollon yields being around expected on the sort of the billion of annual cash flows on that obviously this quarters was so can you just comment on why this quarter was lower why you expect it to move higher over the next months william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so on my comment of that that was more a mix of loans and securities so kind of full fixed rate repricing to your point in this quarter we added a billion at i think were modeling average for q4 and our most recent purchase was kind of in between that and so im feeling good about our numbers there but just to clarify that that of that plus basis points was the repricing of our fixed securities and loans so thats why the numbers little bit higher there samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for the clarification on that and then on the brio deposit base you said that beta just to clarify as well is that on the new production for this quarter or is that the overall book given the short duration of it thats already realized william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah the on the overall portfolio samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then so in terms of new production have you been able to get to near or potentially over webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 william neal holland a chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so i think before the cut to where were priced now were down basis points down basis points for the cut and were actively monitoring for potential additional moves weve done i think the team has done a really nice job of balancing liquidity versus earnings and weve been very prudent in our moves and youll see more downward moves from us in the future as weve seen pretty good client reaction so far through the first cut that weve made samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc great luis massiani a president chief operating officer webster financial corp yeah theres no real difference sam there is no real the portfolio is one rate on the portfolio so new dollars versus the existing portfolio all its not like theres a very diverse product pricing in there so the way to think about it is one overall data for the portfolio which is existing deposits plus new deposits are all getting originated at risk essentially the same exact same yields so the beta on both new and existing would be roughly the same samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you sam operator this concludes the questionandanswer session ill turn the call to john ciulla for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you very much we appreciate everyone joining today and your continued interest in the company have a great day
