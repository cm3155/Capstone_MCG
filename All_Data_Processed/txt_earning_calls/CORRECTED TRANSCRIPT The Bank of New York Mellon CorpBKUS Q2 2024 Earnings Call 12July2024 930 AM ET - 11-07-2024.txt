primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix partially offset by higher interest rates expenses were down yearoveryear on a reported basis and up excluding notable items primarily in the prior year the increase from higher investments employee merit increases and higher revenuerelated expenses was partially offset by efficiency savings from running our company better notable items in the second quarter of the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 this year primarily included an expense benefit from a reduction in the fdic special assessment

investment services fees grew by primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business we continue to see strong momentum in etf servicing with auca of over trillion up more than yearonyear and the number of funds serviced up over yearonyear this growth reflects both higher market values as well as client inflows which included a large etf mandate in ireland from a leading global asset manager in alternatives fund launches for the quarter continued the recent activity in private markets investment services fees for alternatives were up mid singledigits reflecting growth from both new and existing clients the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 in issuer services investment services fees were up reflecting net new business across both

supported osaic since its founding in and we are proud to help the company drive its growth strategy for years to come client demand for wove continues to be strong in the quarter we signed additional client agreements the pipeline continues to grow and we are on track to meet our goal of million to million realized revenue in in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes us securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong throughout the quarter supported by a growing market and active trading and we are excited about the opportunity to do even more for clients having realigned pershings institutional solutions business to clearance and collateral management we can offer clients a choice across a continuum of clearance settlement and financing solutions for those that selfclear as well as those seeking capital and operational efficiency through outsourcing this

offset by net outflows in active equity and multiasset strategies we saw billion of net outflows from index strategies and billion of net outflows from shortterm strategies wealth management client assets of billion increased by yearoveryear reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows page shows the results of the other segment ill close with a couple of comments on our outlook for the full year starting with nii im pleased to report that the first half of the year came in slightly better than we had expected as we saw the decline in noninterest bearing deposits decelerate and we continued to grow interestbearing deposits while we are cautiously optimistic we remain humble as we head into the seasonally low summer months and for now we will therefore keep our nii outlook for the full year unchanged down yearoveryear regarding expenses our goal remains to keep expenses excluding notable items for the full year roughly flat as robin put it earlier bny is in execution mode and were embracing the hard work ahead of us we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be between and and lastly we continue to expect to return or more of earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks our board of directors declared our increased common dividend for the third quarter and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program as always we are calibrating the pace of our buybacks considering various factors such as our capital management targets the macroeconomic and interest rate environment as well as the size of our balance sheet to wrap up we enter the second half of the year on the back of solid fee growth a betterthanexpected nii performance todate and continued expense discipline which gives us incremental confidence in our ability to drive positive operating leverage in with that operator can you please open the line for qa the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is coming from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you good morning robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc good morning id just like to ask dermot about that nii humbleness for the second half can you just walk us through what the moving pieces would be including the seasonality that you mentioned and any other things that might have been overearning in the nii in the first quarter so that you would seemingly in your maintained guide still expect a meaningful rampdown in nii which i dont think is what seems to be the base case given how well the balance sheet has held up so far as you pointed out relative to your expectations thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question ken i guess the best way to answer the question is to look back at last year where q1 q2 typically strong quarters for us q3 typically a seasonally lower quarter summer months clients taking their foot off the gas in terms of activity and then we pick back up again in q4 now as youve seen from this quarters numbers and the first half overall were very pleased with the performance i guess weve outperformed our expectations for the first half and thats in large part due to underlying activity within our core businesses and in my remarks i particularly called out corporate trust where we saw like elevated activity in the clo space which in turn drives deposits so when our core businesses are doing well which theyve all performed well that has a knockon impact in the number of deposits that we have and so we outperformed our expectations in the first half notwithstanding that when i look out at the rest of the year and when we gave the guidance of down in january the market at that time was roughly calling for six rate cuts now were in the middle of the summer we had a slowdown in inflation print yesterday lets see how jay speaks on monday and how he guides out of jackson hole and into a september potential rate cut but we take all of those levers and we just say for now theres no point in me changing guidance to change guidance again in september or october at the next call so were cautiously optimistic i think i used the word last year in march skewed so were playing for the best outcome but we do expect q3 to be somewhat seasonally quieter and thats why we didnt change our guidance ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 okay and then just can you followup just on the size of the deposits so youre just expecting the size of the deposit base to decline or is it the mix just trying to understand like what pieces of it would revert given that seasonality dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so when i think about deposits i kind of i think there are three components to it one is interestbearing deposits where we outperformed plan nibs where we outperformed plan and so pleased with that but that really reflects clients showing up in a different way with us and we showing up in a different way with clients so good and then the third thing and ive talked about this a number of times on previous calls really the strength of the collaboration and teamwork between our treasurer our cio and our global liquidity solutions platform where we think about liquidity as a trillion ecosystem and weve been very much in offense mode this quarter and our gls team has really shown up in a positive way and weve really managed to gather good liquidityfriendly deposits which is kind of fueling the growth of our balance sheet and thats allowed us to do more loans so i think in terms of specifically to your question its both i think the overall balance will come down and as a consequence i would expect nibs from here to grind a little bit lower which is the main driver of the nii change ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay thank you operator our next question is coming from glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much you alluded to the robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello you alluded to the higher clearance and collateral management and higher clearance volumes im just curious if you can parse out how much of that is just clients being more active during a more active second quarter versus winning new business and organic growth it just might help for the thoughts on the goforward and how to model thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 thanks glenn i think its a combination of both so clients are for sure doing more rate volatility in q2 was there for all to see so as a consequence more activity in the treasury market more treasury issuance which feeds volumes so overall very healthy volumes and we have a highmargin scaled business which the platform was able to benefit from that increased level of activity also i think as we did last year we continue to innovate for clients in the domestic market and as we said on our january call the international business is also a key growth opportunity for us and our teams are innovating and developing new products and solutions for our clients internationally and so i think its a combination of all the factors that weve talked about on previous calls showed up as a nice tailwind for us this quarter and for clearance and collateral management i think i do expect that trend to continue in the nearterm glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks dermot you piqued my interest in the opening remarks you all talked about t1 coming into the market and that helping you help clients im curious now that its built now that its in the run rate just a couple of quickies of is there a cost runoff now or is that not big enough does t1 come with lower spread for you but does it free up capital with more frequent settlement im just curious what the net impact of it all is robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey glenn i would describe it in terms of the raw pl impact which is sort of the second part of your question it is really pretty de minimis we spent a bunch of time preparing for this over the course of the past couple of years so it wasnt like there was some big hump in the cost curve in order to really do it we sort of worked the process over time but for us i think the biggest opportunity associated with t1 is whenever theres a market inflection like this and this was one of the more significant ones but were looking ahead to treasury clearing as another good example of something like that it gives us the opportunity to get closer to our clients it creates uncertainty for our clients how is it going to work and they need help navigating it and so the combination of uncertainty and a need for assistance is really the macro opportunity for us and weve leant into that well continue leaning into those types of market changes again with treasury clearing being another good example and i would say overall these types of changes create things that create more efficiency in the market things that can reduce risk in the market things that improve efficiency sure they do sometimes call on more of our products and solutions which of course is great but its also just a good thing for the market to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of market operation and i think over time were also a beneficiary of that glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you operator our next question is coming from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey guys good morning i guess maybe one quick the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc followup dermot for you on nii in response to kens question you talked about fed policy and that having an impact remind us the positioning of the balance sheet if the fed does decide to cut rates come september and we get bps bps of cuts remind us how the balance sheet will behave how we should think about nii in that backdrop dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so thanks for the question so i would kind of id give a couple of different perspectives on that is one cumulative betas are roughly unchanged quarteroverquarter which feels like i really believe our book to be fairly priced as you will remember our book is largely institutional we pass on the rates and so cumulative betas are in good shape so for the dollar portfolio roughly low range and then for euros and sterling were in the high low and so we kind of do a range of scenarios and at the beginning the year were positioned roughly were roughly flat so if chairman powell cuts in september and then cuts again i guess which is the general view of the market were kind of basically nii okay it doesnt really impact the book that much so for small moves were wellpositioned in terms of expectation ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and separately i guess maybe robin for you just in terms of the fee revenue momentum that you talked about at pershing and elsewhere just give us a sense around what the drivers we should be thinking as we think about sort of the mediumterm outlook on fee revenue outside of just pure markets activity that could drive fees in a world where nii might be stable to lower as we think about sort of momentum on the positive op lev operating leverage robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure look revenue growth in any given year is somewhat marketdependent because of course interest rates equity fixed income markets volumes volatility that stuff all moves around but our strategy has been of course to fuel the organic growth of the company but also to try to position our businesses to be able to respond as well as they can to growth tailwinds that exist just in markets and so in answer to the question earlier on around the treasury market weve positioned that business to be able to benefit from what we think is a secular growth in activity the us treasury market so thats a place where were benefiting yes from the market were also benefiting from the investments that dermot detailed and as we go through whats next for our fee growth we talked a lot about our 1bny campaign quarters ago and we talked last quarter and in january about the fact that were sort of operationalizing more and more what started off as a movement of 1bny into referrals into new targets into our commercial model and our chief commercial officer joining and really then getting into the client coverage the practices the integrated solutions which we the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 talked about in our prepared remarks the fact that we can now bundle individual products into true solutions for clients so there are a lot of levers on the fee growth and weve been working very methodically through our plan to build momentum in that space but also to position the business to be able to take advantage of macro things going on in the market ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question is coming from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning robin good morning dermot robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i guess i wanted to build on that earlier line of questioning but really focusing more on repo activity its been a big area of investor focus youve certainly benefited from recent strength on the repo side and i was hoping you could potentially quantify the benefit yearonyear from elevated repo activity and just longer term like how youre thinking about the durability of the recent repo strength and what are some of the factors supporting that view dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question steven so i would say in terms of yearonyear activity cleared repo is not a game changer for us in terms of the overall yearonyear nii story its about overall in its totality it makes up about of our nii today i think i would just echo or follow on from robins answer to the last question in terms of its a product clients wanted we are meeting them where they want to be were innovating this comes under the trillion liquidity ecosystem laide runs that business does a terrific job for us in the cleared repo business specifically were a top three provider and so we have a large installed client base who are looking for products and we can meet them with our cleared repo product and so its just another tool in our toolbox the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 and i would say again were positioned were investing were a scaled player and we can provide automated solutions for our clients so i do expect that business to continue to grow but in terms of the yearoveryear to your specific question its not a material driver of the yearoveryear change robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp steven i would add one thing to it which is just remember that in the context of our business were really the only global solution provider in the space because were scaled in asia were scaled in europe were scaled in the united states and in a world where folks are looking at repo as a collateral tool and an investment tool the opportunity to be able to help clients navigate the whole world in this product provide the seamless connectivity between repo and margin and collateral management the connectivity to other things that we do theres a real appeal to use dermots phrase again about meeting clients where they are theres a real appeal here for clients in terms of the breadth of what we can offer but also the innovation that he referred to earlier on in the call where were creating these new solutions and so this is another example along with the us treasury market but there are so many others in our business of saying theres a macro evolution going on and we have the opportunity to participate in that as long as were frontfooted with clients and as long as were innovating steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for all that color and just for my followup on the pershing business i know that the core underlying strength has been obscured to some degree by some large client departures i was hoping you can give some perspective on what some of the core organic growth trends look like in that business what the pipeline looks like in that business given some of the recent excitement around the wove platform and the offering and have we lapped those headwinds at this point or is there still some remaining pressure on the come dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay so i would say nobody is happier to see the ongoing deconversion of the client to come to an end so we expect that to be fully out of the portfolio by q3 as ive said on previous calls we believe in our ability to earn our way through that deconversion it happens in life and so i think the team has been very resilient in terms of earning their way through it and growing in my prepared remarks i talked about the resign of osaic on a severalyear contract so were very pleased about that you take a step back and you look at where we were months ago we just came off the insite conference in florida where we announced wove months later weve announced a new suite of products to support wove we have signed clients so far this year for wove the momentum is building the clients like it i reiterated my guidance on the prepared remarks about the million to million of revenue for this year and then just ill remind you that were a trillion player in the wealth tech space number one with broker dealers top three with rias and in previous quarters ive kind of guided mid singledigits of underlying core growth through the cycle we continue to believe that notwithstanding on any given quarter it may be slower or better but we believe were in good shape and that there is good momentum in what is a very very large market and in which were a very big player the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks steven operator our next question is coming from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning robin and dermot thanks for taking my questions so we saw the ecb cut rates this quarter and while i know euro isnt a huge exposure for you in terms of your deposit base curious about what impact you saw that on your deposit costs in that currency and maybe how does that experience and the market reaction inform your expectations for beta and customer behavior around rate cuts in other currencies thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say overall euros is roughly of the total portfolio in answer to the earlier question i think we feel very wellpositioned for the range of outcomes that the forward curve is implying in euros sterling and dollars we prepare for it we talk about it a lot and so i feel like the way the cio book is currently set up where we still have a reasonable amount of securities rolling off into higheryielding assets so i feel like the combination of where our deposit book is in terms our betas to reiterate again for dollars low sterling and euros high and the cio book still room to grow and so on rate cuts in terms of how we positioned the book were broadly symmetric on the rate cut side so i think chairman powell has done a good job of telegraphing to the market how he wants to do it so i dont think its going to be a volatile move in rates when it happens so hes allowed us time to position and manage and get into the right place so i think overall i feel very good about where were at brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah but what i was asking i appreciate that what i was trying to understand was the actual experience in the actual marketplace beyond like the expectation did the to beta i think you said in euros did that hold when the cut went through and did you actually experience that dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so specifically yes we did experience that and it held up it behaved as expected brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thank you thank you for that dermot i appreciate that issuer services very solid you flagged some clo trustee gains on the back of a market thats seen solid volume could you help us understand maybe how the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 much of the strength and the growth that you saw in that line was attributed to that which i assume would be in the corporate trust business and then maybe how to think about the depositary receipts fees just so were thinking about the right way to baseline and move forward with our models dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so sure look corporate trust for us a good opportunity a very good opportunity i actually talked about it at some length at the rbc conference in march when i was chatting with gerard cassidy and i think over the last number of years corporate trust for bny is a business thats been underinvested in in both technology and leadership and in both robin and is prepared remarks we did emphasize leadership has been a continuous change for us and weve made a couple of very important hires over the last months in corporate trust and we have new leadership overseeing the business and its that investment in technology products leadership that is showing up and specifically weve doubled our activity in clos over the last months weve improved our market share and as robin said in an answer to another question we really want to position corporate trust as a business that really can take the advantage of scale a lot of manual processes a lot of room for ai a lot of room for digitization and we can improve the operating leverage of that business we can improve how we show up for clients client service so we feel like in corporate trust specifically we have a lot to play for depositary receipts we have good market share we punch above our weight and we expect that to continue brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for taking my questions operator our next question is coming from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robin antony vince a

the t1 discussion earlier could you give us a sense of how much did t1 drive sequential revenue growth this quarter and can you give us a sense as to if theres enough revenue growth youre expecting from it to impact the expense ratio since youve already made the investment and then i have a followup on wove thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp hi betsy its dermot so the point i would make about t1 is not so much a revenue or an expense topic it speaks to resilience as a commercial attribute point that we make on behalf of bny in terms of its been a large the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 scale infrastructure change thats been coming to the market over the last couple of years and as were a key player in financial market infrastructure its very important that we execute that to an a standard and what i would say is bny has shown up for clients in delivering an a execution of a very big project its not really about revenue or expenses its really about delivering a complicated change project for our clients and the ecosystem at large thats really i think the point were trying to make on t1 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay yeah i would just think if youre in a better spot than others you could pick up some incremental share on the back of that but thats maybe a couple of conference calls from here all right then separately on wove i know you mentioned that you added new clients to wove i just wanted to understand is this new clients of the firm or is this clients who had been yours for a while and they moved to wove dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say its both and so i guess the question that weve had on previous calls betsy are we cannibalizing existing clients and the answer to that is most definitely no and i think it speaks to the point of us innovating wove is a very big investment for us in terms of technology over multiple years existing clients like the fact that were willing to put money to work for them and give them better solutions and as a consequence of that we had over people show up to wove in florida last year and nashville this year and for those that are there theres real excitement and as robin said in his prepared remarks its winning awards so theres a flywheel effect of oh wow bny is showing up in the wealth tech space and delivering new solutions for us we want to see what they have to do so the network effect of that shouldnt be underestimated robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp betsy let me doubleclick on it for one second as well because when we started on the wove journey and we announced it as dermot said last year it was initially really focused on that singular kpi of making advisors lives easier and so it was a technology frontend that went from wealth planning and help clients with wealth planning all the way through to portfolio construction and then getting into market now whats evolved since then and what we talked a lot about this year one year later in the wove journey was the fact that now we have the opportunity to link all of these other bny capabilities to be able to deliver to our pershing and wove clients so you can be a clearing and custody client of pershing you can be an advisor taking advantage of that initial set of tooling from wove but what you can now also do is you can have that ability to manage and aggregate data including across multiple custodians we can connect you to models in the investment management space by the way we can fulfill those models because weve got active equity and indexing and all these capabilities that come from bny investments and so wove is becoming a bit more of a delivery vehicle for the various capabilities of the firm and its also opening up the aperture of how clients of pershing think about us in terms of our ability to solve other problems for them bankingasaservice which is a treasury services business but we stimulate the conversation for that because people see us as being more than what we used to be in pershing we also to your question are attracting people who dont necessarily need the clearing and custody service but who want to take advantage of these other components which is why dermot said both because its both and delivering the breadth of 1bny the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks robin robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you betsy operator our next question is coming from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi could you put a little more meat on the bones for the 1bny initiative in terms of products for customers where youre talking about more bundled solutions thematically i understand it and i guess youre having higher core servicing fees but connecting from the higher core servicing fees from the high level lets bundle lets have everyone work together im just trying to connect the dots a little more robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah understood mike and youd asked me a question its probably about more than a year ago now where you had essentially challenged the fact that in order for something like 1bny to be successful it cant just be hearts and minds its got to be deeply operationalized and we talked at that time about some of our future ambitions for how to really bring it home so the way that i would now answer your question is we are rallying around the three strategic pillars that dermot and i both have talked about a bunch and this is about being more for our clients and thats just not just words anymore its not just a movement its not just appealing to our people to be able to be clientobsessed its about elevating the effectiveness of our sales organization and the process driving client service differently than we used to its about the innovative new products as we were just talking about wove thats a good example we are being more for clients in that example and we are also delivering the whole of the company so it is a great 1bny example pershing which used to be somewhat off to the side in the company a few years back now very much at the heart and benefiting from that integration with all of the other capabilities that we have and then you hit on a critical word which is solutions because that next journey to use the term that dermot used earlier on of meeting our clients where they are its not just about us selling a bunch of great products and client platforms to our clients its about the fact that when we look at the challenges that our clients have they actually need things that cut across multiple parts of our company and rather than going in disconnected and showing them individually and trying to have them piece it all together we can now show up and we can actually show them these solutions which bring all the componentry together to solve their needs and both dermot and i talked a bit about that in our prepared remarks and thats the next level of the maturity of that 1bny work that were really doing thats evolving from an initiative and a hearts and minds to making everything that were doing in our commercial organization the sales practices the sales targets the way that were bringing people together the account management process the client service the digital delivery of tooling and the way that were thinking about everything that equips our salespeople to be effective the crosstraining the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 were bringing all of those things together and maturing our commercial model and over time we think theres a lot of value both in the process and in what were actually delivering to clients mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so when you wrap it all up i mean what wallet share do you have per customer today where was it a few years ago where do you hope that to go just in terms of a zip code of expectations robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think some of those metrics as we think about ways in which to show you that story more over time some of those metrics will be in our future right now im going to point you to two things there are a whole bunch of inputs i described a bunch of them and i think over the course of the past couple of years weve been trying to really show the key inputs which we think are the leading indicators for performance and then you have to actually look at the fee growth result and you saw that in the first quarter youve seen that in the second quarter and thats some of the output but the story that dermot and i are both trying to describe is a story of a maturing of a process but with still a distance to go and opportunity ahead dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp mike just to put a metric on it its just to give an indication because we need to mature the metrics as we proceduralize all the strategic comments that robin has just outlined yearoveryear the amount of business that weve won that touches more than one line of business has increased by a third off albeit a very low base so i wouldnt draw too much into the metric but just the fact that we are showing up in a different way and clients are buying products and services from more than one line of business because we can deliver integrated solutions and thats the key that over time well be able to track that and communicate that in a more objective way as that strategy takes root mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc understood so when all is said and done core servicing fees over time whether its aspiration or a specific target where should core servicing fee growth be robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp my answer to that which i recognize is a little bit unsatisfying is were going to keep pointing you back to the positive operating leverage which is really how were focusing for our own growth we think that each quarter each year has a different composition to it but higher fee growth over time is a very important part of that combination of solutions but any individual quarter or a year is going to have a different composition were controlling the things that we can control albeit were stoking the engine for growth of organic fees over time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question is coming from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning thanks for squeezing me in on this i wanted to touch on expenses and operating leverage so expenses up a little bit yeartodate yearoveryear it sounds like you guys are still targeting flat expenses for the year despite the fact that revenues are obviously shaking out a little bit better than you hoped so maybe kind of walk us through where you see the flex in the expense base to keep it kind of at that flattish run rate but i guess more importantly you guys had a target for pretax margin to be at 33plus recently youre doing this quarter and obviously you dont want to get too carried away with a single quarter but it feels like you have an ability to reset the bar so maybe talk a little bit about what that plus within the could look like a couple of years out dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks alex so i guess i would start with the margin part of this we need to consistently do it and so one quarter doesnt a mediumterm target make so im very pleased that weve done it but now i want to see it next quarter the following quarter the following quarter so execution is key and just showing up in a very disciplined way every day is really important to delivering out that we dont want to be known as a onehit wonder so while im pleased that weve managed to do it i want to see it repeated on a consistent basis so thats what i would say on margin on expenses you and i talked in madrid a few weeks back at your conference and i said were in the zip code of flat for the year its all about running the company better its very important that we have people wrapped around the same aspirations that we as a leadership team have and everybody is focused on doing it so there is a real momentum on running the company better which is the input to how we show up with expenses were being where they are as opposed to a topdown approach so a very different cultural experience within the firm in terms of how were doing it and the reason why were a little bit above trend in the first couple of quarters this year is what i said to you at the conference is revenuerelated expenses and so i anchored that in overall where we are for positive operating leverage in the year and in my remarks i said i feel optimistic about delivering positive operating leverage for the year which in a down nii environment bny hasnt really executed to that level before and also q2 is a seasonally strong quarter for us which would feed the margin of so i feel good about expenses i feel good about flat notwithstanding theres pressure to that from a revenuerelated expense part but were very determined to deliver positive operating leverage to our shareholders this year alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc excellent great well my second quick question around the balance sheet there was a lot of discussion around deposits but i wanted to zone in on the asset side of the balance sheet for a second weve seen pretty nice growth from you guys in both the securities portfolio and loans sequentially so could you spend a minute on sort the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 of the sources where youre investing and then your outlook on maybe deploying some of the liquidity that seems to be perhaps a bit more sticky into both loan growth and securities dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so yeah look we feel very proud of the cio book team what theyve accomplished over the last couple of years which is really from q3 of it really has been just a terrific collaboration inside the firm and were deploying where we think we can see opportunity our cio likes to use the word nibbling and so were kind of seeing where the next leg is and were deploying where we think we can see opportunity to continue to grow nii so its opportunistic at the moment but we feel overall very good about that aspect of it were still rolling off the book into higher yielding securities were picking up to basis points and so thats feeding nii and then on loan growth i think the gls team is doing a really good job of getting very liquidityfriendly deposits which has allows us to extend credit to our clients and i think were showing up in a different way to our clients who are important to us and extending our balance sheet to them as they look to buy products in more than one line of business so where we need the balance sheet to support business activities thats what were doing and its a strategic tool in our kit for doing that alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc awesome thanks very much operator our next question is coming from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning dermot good morning robin robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc dermot can you share with us now that were entering into a phase with monetary policy of quantitative tightening easing up a bit you guys obviously have been through qe youve seen the initial stages of qt do you have any thoughts on how this could affect your balance sheet over the next to months have you guys done any type of modeling to see what kind of effect the qt as it shrinks could have on your balance sheet dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so we do a lot of work on that gerard and look ccar forces us to do that work as well and so rates up rates down quantitative tightening quantitative easing we look at it every which way to sunday but the thing that i would kind of remind you and everybody whos listening in is our balance sheet is one of our strengths in this time last year in q1 of last year we called our balance sheet the port in the storm for our clients and you see the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 that flight to quality so were very proud of our balance sheet its vanilla its liquid it stands stress tests and it allows us to be there for our clients so its short in duration we repositioned it going into the higher for longer rate environment as you will remember in q4 of we repositioned it and so weve taken a lot of proactive steps to make our balance sheet durable and liquid and to withstand a wide range of scenarios robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and gerard im just going to add that its easy to think that just because at this very moment in time were looking out and it seems to be some greater consensus than weve had for a little while around what might happen with the fed in the fall across september and the balance of year its easy to think somehow that the range of risks have somehow narrowed as a result of that but theres still a lot uncertainty in the world weve got a whole bunch of other types of geopolitical risks out in the world were sort of continuing to grind through elections that weve talked about through the course of the year there are all sorts of other things happening weve still got wars going on and so our approach to all of these questions and dermot really made the point is to be prepared for all the different types of outcomes that are possible and so you can see us we run conservative on liquidity we run conservative on capital you can see it in our ratios that we talked about and that dermot outlined in his prepared remarks and thats a very important anchor point for us so that we can be agile according to however things play out because the one thing we can be absolutely sure of is they wont play out exactly the way anybody expects gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup robin you talked about the new business wins in the quarter and you talked about 1bny as well it appears that youre having success in chipping down or breaking down some of the silos that many organizations always struggle with can you share with us some of the tools youre using to break those silos and i would assume youre not complete breaking them all down but how far along are you in actually breaking them down robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp well the companys been around for years and weve acquired a lot of different businesses and companies over time and so these things do build up over a period of time but the short answer to your question is we passionately believe as a whole leadership team that the answer to the question is culture and so ive said before in a slightly pithy way but and quoting other people or sort of paraphrasing them if you will that culture eats strategy for breakfast as it was once famously said by peter drucker and we add to that execution eats strategy for lunch thats just a long way of saying that the power our culture pillar which is one of our three pillars is the thing thats enabling us to run our company better and that in turn is allowing us to be more for our clients and so the trick to this for us has been investing in our people its been creating the benefits the experiences the employee experience the pride association with the company the feedback loop that shows that when we do these things we get better outcomes for our clients and that translates into better outcomes in the bottom line and so theres a flywheel effect here that actually builds on itself and the spring in the step of our employees is now powering that forward and thats what gives us confidence that weve really turned the corner on it people want to throw in with the whole because they see that its not only better for the company its actually better for the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 their business because joining their products with other products around the company is allowing us to be more for clients and it actually feels good to see the benefits in the ultimate results so thats for us the north star of how were doing it and while weve certainly got a distance to go the early results have been pretty encouraging gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question is coming from brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc oh great thanks thanks good morning guys maybe if i could just come back to the sticking with the nii guide of down im having trouble getting there just to confirm it sounds dermot like what youre saying is its really almost totally a depositdriven guide on a seasonal basis and i just wanted to sort of confirm that given how youve outlined the balance sheet sensitivity to different rate scenarios is pretty strong and of course you have the benefit of securities portfolio reinvestment so is it really simply just the seasonal deposit dynamic and then if you can just talk about how nibs factor into that seasonal deposit dynamic and then of course as we move into next year in seasonally up of course that we should be back positive again and i just want to confirm that dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i guess brian in the way youve asked the question in some ways youve answered the question to yourself so i will confirm a how youre thinking about it in terms of the seasonal decline and it is a deposit story and i would just kind of reference last year as the guide in terms of in january of last year we guided for the year and then we started out the gates well and you as a collective put pressure on me to change the guidance which i didnt do and we ended the year at and so last year we used the word skewed to the upside but humble about the fact of what lies in front of us and i would say the percentages are different here this year the environment is different but the sentiment is the same im humble about what the outcome could be and uncertainty is there because as robin said for sure what we think is going to happen is not going to happen but i would say that were cautiously optimistic and to your point it is a deposit story and within the deposit story it really is the mix between nibs and ibs brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great okay yeah fair enough there and then maybe just back to the operating leverage dynamic and this can be for both dermot and robin obviously youre starting off really well with like basis pointsplus of positive operating leverage as we move into the second half notwithstanding market movements that would obviously influence the fee revenue dynamic but given the traction that youre showing sequentially in your core business growth and core business sales and i guess the fact that youve made these investments already so i just the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 wanted to get a sense of whether you feel like youre able to scale those investments in the second half and obviously with your flat operating expense guidance it would seem thats the case if the revenue does turn out to be better than expected from a organic growth perspective would we see the expense base creep up a little bit notwithstanding of course youd still generate positive leverage dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay lot of questions in that second question brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say like when i talk to the teams right youre hitting on a very important point in that i really focus on running the company better and then we focus on the operating leverage not expense as a means to an end and if revenuerelated expenses creep up that we starve businesses of investments to solve for a flat number because thats what we said we were going to do i think thats quite important and its important to get the balance right that investment and running the company better it kind of is the same thing and so thats a cultural transformation thats underway with all of our people and so we really are focused on getting value for money we spend a lot of money we spend over billion every year and so we want to get the best value we can for that and we do that in a number of different ways so some of the investments that weve made over the last couple of years were beginning to see the scale impact in that and you can see that in our most profitable segment market and wealth services its a mid margin we continue to invest at the margin which is what you want to see from us and we continue to digitize we continue to automate we continue to reduce manual process which ultimately will feed into head count and better quality jobs for our folks and better careers so i think over time if organic growth plays out it will feed into a better outcome in operating leverage not us just growing expenses because revenues are better robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and i just want to draw out one additional thing that dermot said as well brian which is we have a lot of work to do theres no question about it and he used the term skew and slightly optimistic but staying humble when it related to nii this one is just about a lot of hard work and really focusing on this point about running the company better but as a doubleclick into the way that were thinking about it if you look at the second quarter and weve talked a lot about the fact that its been a seasonally strong quarter but if you doubleclick into it and the market and wealth services point that dermot just mentioned thats an investment story because as weve said were in a good spot on the pretax margin of that segment so we just want more thats growth we dont want to dilute the margin but were not trying to save expense dollars there but in securities services and in investments and wealth where we said there is in fact a margin journey that we have ahead of us thats where you can actually see negative expenses in both of those segments for the quarter which is a sign of the fact that were both investing but were doing even more discipline in those businesses and so thats how the whole thing comes together for the company the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thats great color thank you so much operator and our final question is coming from rajiv bhatia with morningstar please go ahead rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research yeah there is some progress on the investment and wealth management margin in the quarter i guess my quick question is are your margins different on the asset management side of the business versus the wealth management side and do you have a timeline for getting back to that 25plus margin dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i dont think we kind of get into the detail of the split between the two and so the segment overall weve said over the last several quarters we believe we can go back to the margin over a period of a few years and just to follow on from robins answer to the last question weve shown good expense discipline over the last months in terms of okay revenues have been a little bit challenged in the segment due to a variety of reasons and weve taken tough decisions and so thats allowed us to grow the margin by basis points over the last year which really is kind of the financial discipline about it and we do believe where we are now with distribution as a platform very very strong performance in fixed income and ldi and insight that the momentum is there within the segment to grow and as robin said the addition of jose to the leadership team joining in september giving his fresh perspective gives us confidence about what we can do in the future rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research got it thanks robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks rajiv operator this concludes todays questionandanswer session at this time i will turn the conference back to robin for additional or closing remarks robin antony
