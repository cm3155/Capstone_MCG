questionandanswer session also as a reminder this conference is being recorded today if you have any objections please disconnect at this time mr rogers you may begin thomas rogers headfixed income investor relations citigroup inc thank you natalia good morning and thank you all for joining us as natalia mentioned im joined this morning by our chief financial officer mark mason and our treasurer mike verdeschi in a moment mike will take you through the fixed income investor presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom afterwards mark and mike will be happy to answer your questions before we get started id like to remind you that todays presentation may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our sec filings including without limitation the risk factors section of our s all the derivatives across jurisdictional exposures level assets seem to be going up across the industry so i just wanted to understand could you just talk to managing or balancing client needs versus a potential increase in the gsib surcharge and thus being at the lower end of the scb scale so good job there afford you a little more headroom maybe on the gsib side mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes sure so look we all have to remind each other and thats probably not hard to do that were managing through a crisis and as were doing that as you would have heard me say before its important for us to continue to demonstrate balance sheet strength both as it relates to liquidity as well as as it relates to our capital and there is a lot of liquidity thats in the market at this point as firms have shored up their liquidity positions but also as consumers have seen the impact of stimulus and forbearance and the like and so as a result we have seen our balance sheet grow mike would have mentioned in his prepared remarks the growth in the deposit levels that weve seen through the quarter and through the half and we have seen pressure on that gsib score weve seen pressure in the past i think the industry has i think well have to manage through the balance of this year and were constantly looking at the drivers of that well continue to focus on complexity which is an important factor size and across jurisdictional components of the score and manage that particularly through size and mix of our balance sheet with an emphasis on deposits and trading assets but again were focused on the safety and soundness were focused on being there for our clients and the final point id make on this is one you alluded to when you looked at our cet1 stack as was already pointed out we have a stress capital buffer at this point we were estimating for another basis points and so there is a little bit of room and latitude there but again well deal with that as we need to in the meantime were focused on all the things that ive mentioned through the course of the remainder of the year nikhil khosla q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you and a followup on the card portfolio are you seeing any discernible changes in customer behavior this time around with say the crisis or prior recessions maybe customers choosing to pay down citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 card balances or were some other loans or borrowings as cards probably are more important today in this digital world any comments there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc what id say there is id point back to one of my earlier comments in that were in many ways a very different firm than we were as weve come through this crisis versus the prior and that is particularly the case when you look at both our consumer as well as our institutional portfolio and ive spoken before around how the mix of our cards portfolio in the way of fico scores has evolved since the prior crisis so youve got a different portfolio so to speak in terms of the quality of it combined with a different crisis and this crisis for all the reasons weve pointed to already is quite different from the last it started as a health crisis its evolved certainly to an economic crisis but theres also the stimulus and the forbearance actions and all of those types of relief that have played into it and we have to see how that evolves and plays out over time and theres talk of even yet incremental relief as were currently managing through it that has caused different behaviors and so youve heard me reference the number of customers who have opted into some of these forbearance programs youve heard me reference kind of half of them coming off particularly in the us and of them still making payments and so those types of behaviors in some ways are different from prior crises this one is far from being over and as ive mentioned there remains uncertainty and so well have to see whether those positive signs how they ultimately play out but we are seeing some different behaviors given it is a different crisis and we do have a different portfolio and some of that has been certainly positive signs nikhil khosla q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc youre welcome operator your next question is from the line of hima inguva with bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc great thanks for taking my questions for doing the call for all the disclosures mark mike and tom thank you again mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure good morning hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 good morning so my first question is basically on pref issuance and redemptions considering your scb results that came out i just wanted to know considering everything how youre thinking about that for this year and then going forward and then ill follow up with another question michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure hima so no real change in how we approach the pref question were running close to that basis points of rwa that ive talked about in the past so that level remains relevant in addition to other factors such as how our balance sheet may evolve and taking into account the environment that were operating in then well evaluate those calls that are coming due first based on the need for that capital and assuming that we did need it then well look at the economics associated with simply leaving that security outstanding versus calling it and then replacing it so the very same approach that weve been talking about but i think obviously as mark talked about a period of uncertainty we do have to evaluate how that balance sheet may evolve over time hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc okay great got it and then the next one really on subordinated debt and i know ive been asking this question many times on the call the reason im asking it again is because we are living in a very different environment and considering your macroeconomic outlook any risks there if you see a change in the way you think about need for issuing subordinated debt mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc im sorry hima i couldnt make out the last part of your question can you repeat it please hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc im sorry the question is around need to issue sub debt if you see a reason or opportunity to issue subordinated debt going forward sorry was that clear michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hima so yeah thats clear even there i talked about a level of around basis points of rwa and weve been running well in excess of that level and even when you look at the breakdown of that it is something that weve been paying attention to the sub debt securities alone have us a bit over that basis points but as weve added reserves thats now added another call it basis points or so so were well in excess of the level that we had targeted so i would still say same answer that theres really no need for that additional issuance at this time but again we never want to say never well always talk about remaining opportunistic and evaluating where there is opportunity but i would note that were well in excess of that targeted range hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you very much citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc thanks hima operator your next question is from the line of robert smalley with ubs robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning thanks for doing the call a couple questions on issuance also you said youve done to the majority if not the remainder from the holdco when i look back last year versus this year youre running about a billion surplus excuse me increase to the surplus that you ran last year is there a reason for that when im looking at tlac thats coming off im seeing maturities from the second half of next year coming into this year coming in now so theres a lot of disqualification but i really dont see a lot of callable debt between now and the end of the year so does that inform your thinking at all and i also just wanted to ask on a separate note if you could talk a little bit about whats going on in mexico in terms of the economy how thats impacting your portfolio and how that stands out versus the general economy in mexico and what youre doing to insulate yourselves there michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure so ill take that first question around the issuance and just to give some broader perspective on it first starting with the bank if you go back to the beginning of the year our expectation was that we would be in and around billion of issuance in some combination of bank and nonbank and of course with the great deposit growth that weve seen over and above what weve needed for loans weve just not had that need to issue out of the bank at this point and so as you noted we definitely weighted it towards the nonbank issuance and when you think about that nonbank issuance were in a good position right now weve seen an increase in our lcr our tlac buffer ive talked about a range of billion to billion even as we went into the year that was probably double that targeted range in terms of what we had as a surplus and now of course were looking at billionplus of that tlac surplus so one of the things that were looking at were obviously going to be mindful that tlac will decay and call it maybe billion over the remainder of the year another thing ill be looking at is that leverage relief that will be expiring at the end of the first quarter and again these things are out there a bit we certainly have some time so we do have the flexibility around our issuance program but that being said weve always talked about being opportunistic well evaluate what our investor preferences are well be evaluating how spreads are performing and so we certainly leave ourselves room to continue to issue despite being in a favorable position from that tlac as well as from that liquidity perspective mark maybe on the robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc before the next question just a quick followup any reason that you havent done a 30year lately like most of your peers have citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc no you know what i think theres no real reason for that i think clearly what you saw us do early in the crisis is we did issue longerterm we did that 20year transaction that really was a function of the front end of the curve being dislocated so we did have a preference to issue further out on the curve as we did and 20year but really its just going to be a function of what our needs are and where our investor demand is so well always look at the 30year as well and see if theres a need out there and what that client what that investor preference may be but hard to know exactly what those plans may be over the rest of the year well be evaluating opportunities as i mentioned earlier robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc okay sorry to interrupt on the mexico mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc no thats quite all right and i think mike i was going to add one point i think mike hit it which is this is obviously an ongoing assessment of our needs and we try to be opportunistic as it makes sense to do so with regard to mexico let me make a couple comments one i just would point out that we have a very strong franchise and position in mexico across many products that we offer were number one or number two whether you look at deposits or lending products et cetera et cetera and weve been very disciplined around the target market client that weve been focused on and as you know weve made a considerable amount of investment into our franchise over the past couple of years and thats investment in kind of building out some of our branches but equally important kind of enhancing our digital capability and our mobile offering which in a time like this is certainly proving to pay dividends as you point out theres certainly gdp contraction thats going on in mexico its undeniable theres a slowdown in industry volumes that in many ways are exacerbated by the covid19 situation and were seeing cases grow and unemployment is likely to increase and so as a result were watching the macro very closely weve put assistance programs in place for our cards customers for our mortgage customers for our personal loan and payroll loan customers as well as small business banking and those include deferrals of minimum payments and temporary rate reductions and fee waivers and the like id point you to we are seeing kind of a flight to quality as it relates to deposits our deposits have grown in mexico both on the consumer side which are up about as well as the institutional side which deposits there are up about and so continued client engagement which i think is very important but weve seen that through this crisis and then id also mention that when you look at our exposure in mexico its important to put that in context and so weve got about billion of kind of funded exposure as of the end of the second quarter across both the gcb and the icg thats call it roughly percentage points if you will of our total loans about billion of that are consumer loans about billion are corporate loans and when we look at the consumer loans is in cards and personal loans and there were targeting a higherquality customer segment certainly higher than many of our local peers and theyre priced accordingly and a higher percentage of transactor clients and of our payroll loans are concentrated in sectors that have citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 a lower risk of layoffs so think about government employees and pensioners and think about that in the context of my earlier point around rising unemployment and another of the portfolio is in mortgages for example and in our mortgage portfolio theres an average ltv of less than so again focused on highquality customers but also structuring the portfolio to manage the risk accordingly on the corporate side that billion roughly half of those loans are basically a traditional corporate lending book and so those are the large mexican companies and subsidiaries of large multinationals that domicile outside of mexico so again staying core and true to our strategy a large percentage being investmentgrade and roughly of the corporate loan portfolio has a maturity thats less than a year and so i highlight those dynamics to not only support the idea that we do have a strong franchise but we have a highquality franchise that doesnt mean that its not without or that its without risk but we feel good about the reserve levels that weve built and well continue to kind of manage that very closely and our view is that longer term we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities in mexico just given competitive labor markets given the continued expansion of its middle class given the underpenetrated banking sector and in particular our corporate clients as they begin to reevaluate and reposition their supply chains coming out of this crisis and so i think there are a number of things to highlight there which i feel like ive done but its not without risk but were managing that very very closely robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thank you that level of detail is greatly appreciated thats very helpful mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc youre welcome robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc and thanks for doing the call again mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc you bet operator your next question is from the line of brian monteleone with barclays brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi brian citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc if i could follow up on the preferred question so when i think about there are a couple preferreds that come up for the first call later this year with the resets of liborplus somewhere between and basis points which in the current context of the market seems neutral to marginally expensive can you talk about like how you think about evaluating economics but also are there any other factors such as whats going on with libor going away or anything else that will kind of factor into that economic decision when it comes michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc brian so really those are the types of things well evaluate certainly the economics as you point out the spread we know spreads have moved out quite wide across the industry and across all issuers for that matter and while weve seen with the feds actions to add liquidity to the system and introduce new facilities that has been a big contributor to spreads coming in but they are still widened and so youre right when we look at the prefs and the opportunity to call we will be doing as you indicate looking at the spreads on the existing structures and evaluating if we wanted to maintain them what it would cost to replace and to the extent things are wide that will be certainly a key factor the other point is yes is that well be looking at other factors like libor transition and fallback language and that would be another consideration and keep in mind that these calls theyre quarterly so theres a call that would be coming up and then obviously if we decided to not call there would still be opportunities to call in the future so i think you described it well there are the economics and then there are other factors too that we would always be looking at brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks mike and then i appreciate all the kind of color and detail around the business in mexico do you guys have what credit losses to loans are in mexico versus maybe other books maybe like versus the us book or the aggregate credit loss to loans across the business mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look in mexico we have lets take the cards portfolio for example the mexico cards portfolio we have reserves against balances that are roughly plus so or so in terms of the reserve levels and in a way that is tied to kind of the structural losses that we tend to see in mexico and frankly the margins and the pricing around that also kind of correlates with the structure of performance that we see there so reserve levels or reserves to balances are higher certainly for the cards portfolio in mexico relative to what we show in the us brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc got it thanks mark i appreciate it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 operator your next question is from the line of gary kessler with goldman sachs asset management gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking good morning thanks again for hosting the call mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking another followup on preferreds related to structure and as you think about accessing this market again so far youve issued a sofr reset and given the market has moved more towards this fiveyear cmt structure is there anything that would make you hesitant to issuing that structure just in light of are committee obligations or any other focus on the sofr as a replacement benchmark or would you consider kind of going with an industry norm michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure thanks for the question as i said before when weve done these structures and issuance in general there are a couple of factors that we consider certainly the libor transition and being supportive of the new benchmarks that had been established so that has been a factor but of course were going to be responsive to what our investor needs are and what theyre looking for and we recognize with sofr moving lower that there may be some preference for cmt thats certainly something we would consider in our structures going forward so we want to be supportive of that libor transition but at the same time were going to be responsive to our investor appetite as well gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking great and i had one other question and this is around ccar and the resubmission process and what would you comment on if you can on anything weve got maybe a few blurbs on the timing but any other thoughts on your approach to resubmission what youre focused on anything related to capital returns or do you think that is just completely off the table until next summer mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure why dont i take that so there isnt a lot of new information beyond whats out there publicly in terms of the timing so as we currently know it we would expect to get scenarios by the end of september and have some days or so to respond from when we do get those scenarios and that the balance sheet data is likely to be as of the end of june so june i think is whats been stated i would imagine that the stress scenario would be more reflective of the current environment were managing through and the stresses associated with this crisis and we will obviously work to prepare to make sure that we can adhere to all of the submission requirements i think what id say is i kind of go back to the first question just as i look at our position going into it i feel good about our position going in weve got an cet1 ratio if you look at kind of we added a page i think its citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 page in the back of the deck that kind of just shows how that compares relative to the minimum requirements in the case of a standardized approach were basis points above that minimum basis points on an advanced basis thats another billion of capital above the binding requirement and we feel good about the balance sheet that we have kind of going into the scenarios and even when you look at the last submission and whats been reported publicly while our scb was at that was the floor we got floored at that level and so when you look at the peaktotrough losses plus dividends it was closer to suggesting that theres room there to absorb lower ppnr or higher stressed losses before we would have gotten to that floor now all of that said hard to know exactly what those scenarios will look like that we get at the end of september but we feel good about where we stand going into it in terms of the latter part of your question on capital returns as weve stated before were managing through a crisis were managing through an uncertain period of time the industry took some actions earlier in the year as it relates to buybacks weve been very clear of our intent to continue to pay dividends and we feel as though weve demonstrated performance through this crisis that supports that and we expect to continue to do so obviously subject to board approval gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking great thank you so much mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you operator your next question is from the line of scott cavanagh with apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc thanks guys for having the call its always greatly appreciated i just wanted to circle back onto the cards so just for comparison versus your peers could you further break out your macro assumptions for cecl are you going beyond fourth quarter so unemployment for fourth quarter and then fourth quarter of the next year and the following year just so we can kind of get a sense of how you guys are positioned in your outlook versus others and then looking at the experience in your branded versus retail cards can you just delineate what youre seeing in the difference there and then on the retail side given the all the distress with retailer distress and the advent of cecl how are the conversations going with these retailers and are there any big retailers portfolios that are up for bid in the near term mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc okay youll certainly remind me if i dont get everything there okay so thank you so first let me start with the scenario which as you know is critically important to forecasting the cecl reserves but is also something that certainly moved a great deal through the first quarter and continues to evolve given were still managing through this crisis what weve assumed as we look at the scenario is the second quarter we kind of assumed unemployment peaking at about gdp falling 35plus percent quarter over quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 and as ive said before whats important from here is the shape and the pace of the recovery and obviously how significant a second wave is and all of those things come into play as i look at our base scenario we have gdp recovering sequentially in the third quarter and so call it full year down and unemployment recovering to under by the fourth quarter of and down to a level of by the fourth quarter of now that assumes that any potential second wave is wellcontrolled that theres an appropriate fiscal response if needed to maintain kind of a healthy pace of recovery i think the important thing as i mentioned earlier is there continues to be a significant amount of uncertainty in our approach to cecl just we consider the probability of alternative downside scenarios and we build additional reserves as appropriate and so in the case of the billion that we have in allowance for credit losses that i referenced earlier that includes billion to account for billion roughly to account for the possibility of a more adverse outcome and so hopefully that gives you a sense we have a scenario we realize that its hard to forecast with precision so we look at alternative scenarios and come up with an estimate for the uncertainty and then we build on top of that in terms of your question around the retail performance versus the branded performance id make a couple of comments i guess one is that again the quality of those books has evolved certainly since the last crisis and again we focus on some of the higher fico scored customers similarly the important driver probably one of the most important variables on the consumer side is what were seeing in the way of unemployment in this particular case as you know we have additional factors such as the stimulus and the forbearance plans that we put in place and those will impact how things move through the delinquency buckets and so were not seeing in either of those portfolios increases in our to 89day buckets as people have or benefiting from the forbearance activity that is there we are seeing people continue to pay that are part of those relief programs and were seeing people as they come out of those relief programs continue to pay i mentioned earlier that of those that have come out of the programs are continuing to pay what i would highlight in addition to that is on the retail services partner side its important to remind ourselves that the nature of those relationships are were not only partners but we work very closely with these corporate partners in how theyre running their businesses and so through this crisis weve been very engaged on how they think about things such as their digital online offerings and the like and theyve been different for different partners who have some of whom have continued to operate as theyve been declared essential others of whom have worked on strategies where theyve had pickups as the stores manage through closures and weve been part of that dialogue i think the other important thing is that theres sharing that goes on with these partners and that flows through the economics and pl that we reflect in that sharing also pertains to losses and so while we build these reserves for our retail service partner programs the ultimate losses that play through we share with those partners and that sharing flows through on an adjustment to the revenue sharing that we would make and so think about the reserves associated with the retail services program as being roughly to of what ultimately played out in the way of ncls would be picked up by the partner and so hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense im not sure if i missed any components of your question but im happy to address it if i did scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc no no thats perfect and i really appreciate the additional disclosure this quarter and color its very helpful one thing id note that others have been putting out the payment trends looking across their portfolios that might be citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 a helpful addition to your presentation just to give a sense given youre such a big credit card player there just to see what trends youre seeing that would be helpful for us mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me comment on that because we have talked to that in the earnings call just in terms of purchase sales activity im sorry you were referencing payment trends scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc all of the above mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc all of the above so just first on purchase sale activity weve referenced how weve seen that trend go from the high if you will across the entire portfolio in april that is to say down as much as 30plus percent in terms of purchase sale activity to end of june and through july kind of being in the low to midteens and so we are seeing good traction there well see how it plays out as spikes tend to occur or are starting to occur in certain parts of the us but we have seen a positive trend there the point that id make on your payment question is that there too i think ive pointed to the idea that or the fact that we are seeing continued payments of people that are both on the forbearance programs as well as theyve come off and so people customers who are not contractually obligated continuing to pay and weve seen to of customers enrolled in consumer relief programs across the globe continue to make payments so almost of our branded cards and of retail services almost of mexico card customers more than of our asiapac card customers of our mortgage customers so high percentage of customers that have signed up for these programs continuing to make payment which again we think is a good sign as we sit here today so hopefully that helps scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc very much so thanks again appreciate it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc youre welcome operator your next question is from the line of mark kehoe with mackay shields mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc hi good morning just had two questions one rather vague i just wondered whether you could comment on ph given the impress end of the liquidity injections by the fed and the use of the banks to provide that kind of liquidity to the economy what you think regulators going forward look more on liquidity regulations and supercharge those rather than look at capital for recognizing kind of the role of banks has changed post this crisis thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc mark look i think its hard to say how their views may evolve i think when i think about the prefinancial crisis and postfinancial crisis the amount of work thats gone into both internally and sort of from a regulatory perspective building metricsbased frameworks that are rolled out broadly i think thats really so well embedded in the financial institutions and how they operate today both again informed by regulation and of our own standards that its hard to see how that evolves clearly you raise a good point where theres a lot of liquidity thats been put into the system and you could see were running quite high on deposits and a lot of that liquidity has been either left at the central bank account or used to purchase securities and so very high liquidity cushions but at the same time theres going to be a focus on how we manage those capital levels and then how we think about how that capital performs in stress as informed by ccar and of our own evaluation so i think side by side its going to remain critical that we evaluate both i expect our regulators to continue to evaluate both quite carefully so i think thats going to be very much a continued focus mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think thats right mike i think that look there will be a lot of lessons learned when we do get out of this crisis im encouraged by the fact that the industry came into this crisis in a much stronger position than we went into the last one and i certainly feel that way about our firm that has allowed for us i think to be helpful in shoring up the economy and importantly working very closely with our clients working with our clients as they manage their uncertainty and shore up liquidity but not just with our balance sheet but also in facilitating their access to the markets thats also allowed for us to work closely with the regulators as theyve provided liquidity into the markets and have made appropriate adjustments to some of the regulations to ensure that there can be a collaborative effort to shore things up and i would imagine coming out of that as i mentioned there will be lessons and adjustments and different ways that we want to think about how we manage the capital markets and the impact that it can have on the global economy but its premature to speculate how that will ultimately play out mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc and just lastly then have you mentioned your macro assumptions for both mexico and latin america in terms of the gdp decline expectations you have for the reserve build mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i have not i did not mention that and do not intend to at this point obviously theres pressure as i mentioned that continues to exist there but thats all factored into the reserve levels that we talked to mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc great thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes operator your final question comes from the line of jeff bernstein with insight investment jeffrey bernstein q analyst insight investment hi just a short question most of my questions have been asked and answered regarding your macro assumptions for reserving what did you assume for the stimulus thats expiring in a few days mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so we didnt have an explicit assumption around that but as i mentioned we assumed that there would be continued support in order to ensure a smooth recovery if you will and so that is to suggest that if there was a need which obviously there is or its been determined that there is then we would have accounted for it but we didnt explicitly have an assumption around more stimulus activity jeffrey bernstein q analyst insight investment thank you and lastly i realize that cecl wasnt designed to have macro assumption changes every quarter and this is an unusual time but as things hopefully settle down even if your macro assumption should change not you but everyones macro assumption should change up or down slightly is that going to change reserves on a quarterbyquarter basis mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc let me try to answer your question and again if i dont just ask me again so the way i think about this is that youre right i dont think we contemplated significant moves in these assumptions quarter to quarter and to the extent that the forecast that we have for the economic scenario and the variables here play out as we have forecasted them you would expect that the reserve levels would move in tandem with the ncls so with the losses that start to play out with probably the one exception one important exception which is how balances change so to the extent that we start to build new loans there obviously would be new lifetime reserves that get established for that new lending activity but all other things being equal you wouldnt expect significant movement in the reserve levels now as we saw in the second quarter if those variables move or the view of that outlook deteriorates that ends up with a different outcome so hopefully that addresses your question jeffrey bernstein q analyst insight investment it does thank you very much mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 29jul2020 great operator that concludes the questionandanswer session mr rogers do you have any closing remarks thomas rogers headfixed income investor relations citigroup inc id just like to thank
