executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thanks ab and good afternoon everybody thanks for joining us today ill review the fourth quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will provide additional comments before we open it up for your questions well in the fourth quarter cullenfrost earned million or a share compared with earnings of million or a a share reported in the same quarter of last year that represented an increase of you dont get to say that very often our return on average assets and average common equity in the fourth quarter were and respectively that compares with and for the same period last year these are very strong results and along with our strategy of sustainable organic growth they position us well heading into now taking a closer look at the quarter loan growth was solid and above our longterm expectation of high single digits annual growth average loans excluding ppp in the fourth quarter were just over billion compared with average loans of billion in the fourth quarter of an increase of for the full year average total loans excluding ppp were up our growth in loan balances for the fourth quarter versus the third quarter represented approximately twothirds of ci growth and onethird consumer cre balances were basically flat we booked billion in new commercial commitments in the fourth quarter and this is up by a nonannualized from the third quarter and demonstrated our staff success from our calling and prospecting efforts earlier in the year that said i believe its clear that the feds program of interest rate increases is having an impact on economic activity especially in the commercial real estate sector as more borrowers evaluate the impact of the current environment on their projects for example i think its interesting to look at our weighted 90day pipeline at yearend its down from the previous quarter however the prospect component of that pipeline is up while the customer segment of that pipeline is down so as we continue to see potential deals come in from prospects as our strong available liquidity and our consistent underwriting shine through our current customer base reflects the overall softening of the commercial real estate market average deposits in the fourth quarter were billion an increase of more than compared with the billion in the fourth quarter of last year and for the fullyear average total deposits were billion up over and jerry will talk more about recent deposit trends in his comments we continue to see great growth in our consumer banking business average consumer loans were billion in the fourth quarter up by over the fourth quarter last year this is primarily from our consumer real estate products of heloc home equity and home improvement the outlook for these loans continues to be good and credit strong in fact the consumer loan growth in was of our previous best year the sharp increase in mortgage rates created the perfect environment for our secured consumer real estate loans such as home improvement home equity and heloc credit quality is outstanding in this portfolio and our average credit score is cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 im also pleased that we recently began funding loans in our mortgage program our team has created a new mortgage loan process from the ground up to originate and service mortgage loans in keeping with the frost philosophy and weve created a great digital and mobile experience around it once we complete this pilot program well roll out mortgage lending to customers on a more limited basis with the goal of opening it up to everyone later this year growth in new households continues for the year we added almost new households about higher than the number of customers we had at the end of last year while we believe this represents bestinclass organic growth it was down slightly from last years alltime high of almost customers and thats related to the lower net number of branches that we opened in given the increase in opening since then we expect to achieve alltimehigh number of new customers in in addition our frost wealth advisors has seen a record amount of new business regarding our branch expansion efforts the original houston expansion branches have surpassed billion of deposits and they continue to exceed pro formas loans totals million at yearend including the additional branches weve opened in what we call houston expansion at yearend we stood at of our household goal of our loan goal and of our deposit goals and well continue to add new locations and strong areas around the region in dallas we are very encouraged by the early results of the new sites which are doing even better than what houston had achieved in the same timeframe of the new household goal of loan goal and of our deposit goal we added new financial centers at a rapid pace in the fourth quarter and soon well be up to locations under the program overall credit quality remains good problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher totaled million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with million at the end of the previous quarter and million a year ago we reported a million credit loss expense in the fourth quarter net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were million compared with million in the fourth quarter of annualized net charge offs for the fourth quarter were basis points of periodend loans nonaccrual loans were million at the end of the fourth quarter an increase from the million at the end of the third which was the result of two small credits with regard to the current economic environment there are potential risk on the horizon that could result from higher interest rates continuing high inflation and pockets of supply chain disruption overall investor commercial real estate loan metrics remain stable and indicative of aboveaverage project operating performance across all portfolio asset types while acceptable debt service coverage ratios are still reported for office multifamily office warehouse and retail asset types a yearoveryear decline is observed at fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates higher operating expenses for multifamily and the inclusion of now completed construction projects that remain in leaseup regarding specifically the office portfolio our optimism around this asset class stems from one the character and experience of the sponsors two the predominantly class a nature of most portfolio office projects three tenant quality and lease duration and four strong existing office portfolio metrics including low loantovalue at an average number of and weighted average debt service coverage ratio of times for the current stabilized office assets cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 office buildings outstanding at yearend were billion and of this amount half was owneroccupied and half represented investor projects our energy loan portfolio of concentrations remains in the single digits at of loans excluding ppp at the end of the fourth quarter our energy borrowers as a whole have advanced rates and leverage ratios that are the lowest weve experienced in many years as borrowers have continued a program of deleveraging and returning more to shareholders the current oil and gas price environment continues to be favorable for them and our borrowers generally have a bullish outlook for prices for the near and intermediate term frost will continue to offer energy lending with prudent structures including appropriate advance rates and hedging structures to minimize risk weve done a great job with closing out the ppp forgiveness process so i want to say i remain proud of our team that worked so hard and the relationships that weve built and strengthened with customers when they needed the help most we say this often that weve got a lot going on for us were expanding into new areas with beautiful new financial centers were enhancing our consumer offerings with all new mortgage loans were strengthening our communities and growing our brand awareness with exciting new sponsorship opportunities that will pay dividends for many years and best of all we are continuing with our strategy of sustainable organic growth its kept our company strong and positioned us well for whatever the future holds day in and day out our employees do all this while adhering to our core values of integrity caring and excellence and by providing industryleading customer service at frost we truly work hard to be a force for good in peoples everyday lives now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was up basis points from the reported last quarter higher yields on both balances held at the fed and loans had the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage the increase was also positively impacted to a much lesser extent by a higher yield on investment securities and by higher volumes of both investment securities and loans these positive impacts were partially offset by higher cost on deposit and both higher volumes and cost of repurchase agreements looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the fourth quarter up million from the third quarter average as we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the quarter we made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately billion which included million in agency mbs securities with a yield of and million in municipal securities with a taxable equivalent yield of about for our current expectation is that we would invest an additional billion of our excess liquidity into investment purchases during the year or about billion net of projected inflows during the year the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the fourth quarter was up basis points from the third quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion up approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter impacted by the higher yields on recently purchased agency mbs securities our tax exempt municipal portfolio averages about billion during the fourth quarter up about million from the third quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of up basis points from the prior quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 at the end of the fourth quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter was years up from years at the end of the third quarter impacted by the extended duration of our agency mbs securities in this higher rate environment looking at deposits on a linked quarter basis average deposits were down billion or with about half of the decrease coming from demand deposits and half coming from interest bearing deposits customer repos for the fourth quarter averaged billion up billion from the billion average in the third quarter we have seen some deposit flows into our repo product during the quarter total combined deposits and customer repos in the fourth quarter averaged billion up million from the prior quarter the cost of interest bearing deposits for the quarter was up basis points from the third quarter regarding credit loss expense during the fourth quarter we booked credit loss expense of million which represents the first quarter we booked at credit loss expense this year the credit loss expense was driven by growth in unfunded commitments unfunded commitments grew million during the quarter ending at billion at the end of the year looking at noninterest income on a linked quarter basis trust and investment management fees were up billion or as increases in estate fees of million investment fees of and real estate fees of were partly offset by a decrease in oil and gas fees down million due to lower commodity prices service charges on deposit accounts were down or primarily as a result of lower commercial service charges down million largely resulting from a higher earnings credit rate on annualized balances partially offsetting this decrease was a increase in combined consumer and commercial overdraft charges insurance commissions and fees were down million or from the third quarter as a result of lower life insurance commissions which were down and also impacted by our normal business cycle other income was up million primarily due to a million distribution received from an sbic investment regarding total noninterest expenses total noninterest expense was up million or compared to the third quarter the primary drivers were salaries and wages up million or and other expenses up million or compared to the third quarter the increase in salary and wages was impacted by a million increase in stock compensation as those stock awards are made in october of every year and some by their nature are expensed immediately additionally accrued incentives were up million from the prior quarter the increase in other noninterest expense of million was impacted by higher fraudrelated losses of million million related to a licensing negotiation and marketing and advertising up million which is typically higher in the fourth quarter looking at our projection of full year total noninterest expenses we expect total noninterest expense for the full year to increase at a percentage rate in the midteens over our reported level our continued expansion in houston and dallas and the introduction of our mortgage product accounts for about of that projected growth also impacting the projected growth rate is significant investments that we will be making in information technology for both people and infrastructure investments in marketing in both advertising and people as we focus on expanding the communication of our value proposition and expense growth is also impacted by costs associated with continued support of our staff cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was or about excluding discrete items our current expectation is that our full year effective tax rate for should be in the range of about to but that can be affected by discrete items during the year regarding the estimates for full year earnings our current projections include a basis point fed rate increase in february followed by a basis point decrease in july given those rate assumptions and the noninterest expense growth of midteens we currently believe that the current mean of analysts estimates of is reasonable with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry well open it up for questions now question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions the first question today is coming from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hi ebrahim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just first wanted to follow up on remarks around phil around commercial real estate so you noted two things one you mentioned the impact from rate hikes was having an impact on the pipeline cooling off but at the same time we talked about the strength of your book but give us just like how do you see this playing out if interest rates dont get cut one and maybe this may not play out at first but do you see credit pain in the sector across your markets to manifest themselves over the next months across multifamily office and how do you think that translates to impacting cash flow for your customers maybe it has a pressure on rent rolls as we look out would love some color on that and just your thought process around both the risk for the market and how it may come back and translate in terms of risk to frost thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 okay thanks ebrahim well we are seeing some tightening on debt service coverage ratios as i mentioned but we dont expect lets take multifamily for example to be underwater on those the word that i got from our credit people was ill quote is so we feel pretty good about it if you look at i think i gave you what our loanto value on offices was it was about if you look at our loantovalue on multifamily its about half of our deals are will be completed in the other half in so i dont think theres a lot of pressure today as it relates to our portfolio i also hear from our people that rents are keeping up for now so thats helping things but costs are also increasing i think in this market its if you have issues its been kind of what everyones been hearing its going to be the lower class office buildings where youve got youre losing tenants and youve got some risk around that but i didnt want to give i dont want to give the feeling that weve got problems i just want to make sure im being honest if things are tightening up if you took a look at our portfolio i was asking about i guess the office portfolio i think we have million of what might be problem credits on what is the portfolio its probably over billion right so you dont really have much that are issues and theyre kind of specific but so again i dont want to give the impression things are too negative but i do want to give the impression things are not as good as they were i would also say that property tax is a big problem around here and theyve seen a big increase so when you combine that with interest rates and then also operating costs on apartments multifamily its going to create some pressure but at this point not so much again offices are probably the biggest concern id say generally in the market because i dont think anybodys figured out whats going to happen with offices over the next couple of years were still trying to figure it out as a business so im sorry i dont have any better clarity in that but thats what were seeing ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch no thats helpful color and then one jerry you mentioned about the earnings outlook for the year give us a sense of what you expect in terms of net interest income growth for the year and how you see that trending do you expect nii continues to grow given just what you expect in terms of loan and deposit growth or do you see some trajectory where nii declines quarterly at some point in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah sure i think that i said last quarter we got a little bit into and we were talking about the nim percentage i think that were currently i dont expect that the fourth quarter was our peak i still think that obviously we had a nice increase between the third and fourth quarter basis points i dont see that sort of a growth coming into the first quarter but certainly we do expect some improvement and in my mind i think given our assumptions that well see a rate increase in february and then a decrease in july i would expect that our nim is probably given our assumptions probably peaks in the third quarter as far as were not going to give specific percentage growth on net interest income but its yearoveryear i think we grew between and say i dont think well be there based on kind of what im seeing but i think were going to have strong growth this year compared to last ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator thank you the next question is coming from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on the deposit side so the outflows of noninterest bearing were fairly sharp a bit more than we were looking for and i know you mentioned repos but could you give it a little bit more color what you saw in the quarter what you might still see a risk of moving out of noninterest bearing and where do you see that mix stabilize jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well noninterestbearing i think what i said on the noninterest bearing is thats really been kind of the area that ive been concerned about that we had some exposure there and i continue to think thats really the area where we have the most exposure with rates where theyre at today and we all know theres some pretty nice rates out there i think that it really is compelling a lot of treasurers and cfos to make sure that theyre managing their liquidity well and looking for alternatives i think that certainly we can be competitive in a lot of situations but theres probably going to be cases where were going to see some deposit outflow on especially on some of the larger balances especially i think thats where most of the risk is i dont think its anywhere unique to anybody i think that from a deposit rate standpoint our rates i think are competitive with banks so i think the challenge becomes trying to compete with some alternative sources but i do expect that the commercial side on the commercial dda is probably the most at risk in my mind steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then jerry in terms of the loantodeposit ratio moved up slightly through i hear where youre saying im putting liquidity to work in the securities book but should we expect a similar trend through just basically funding loan growth with deposit growth jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that for i think that probably the bigger unknown in my mind is more of what happens on the deposit side than what happens on the loan side i think phil has given some good color of what were seeing in loans i cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 think without knowing exactly what happens in the economy there might be a little uncertainty there but i think we feel pretty confident i think its that deposit side so you could because weve always said the loantodeposit ratio from our standpoint is really a results in fact right because were really out to grow both deposits from a relationship standpoint and loans so i think that given that i dont project that well have the sort of increase in deposits that weve had the last couple of years i expect that to be much more muted in you may get some improvement in that ratio just simply because the denominator decreases steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then finally on the expense side so you reported midteens expense growth basically in line with what you had guided for the year now guiding midteens for and more investments that youll have to make when you guys take a longerterm view do you think for a period of time we just beyond we stay in this midteens range or do you see this as sort of a twoyear scenario and then we get back to something more normal after that thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc steve its a good question i think the simple answer is is an unusual year for us i expect to see our run rate on expense growth to go down in and jerry mentioned the it investments mentioned marketing ive been as ive talked to investors over the last couple of years ive been pretty open that there are some things were going to invest in were going to invest in physical distribution and i hope by now weve proved to everyone that thats a payoff for shareholders whore going to continue to be were going to continue to do that we sort of set that aside okay but were also going to invest in people and you saw those numbers on salaries i mean theyre pretty sobering but we were competing in the marketplace i think were being successful there i think weve reached a place where were touching bottom and i was looking at our turnover rates last year it was in our turnover was call it this year it was excuse me in it was it was down from in so that tells me that we are hitting the right balance of what we need to be paying people weve done a lot on benefits making sure that we have comparative and really top quality benefits in areas of healthcare and retirement and those kind of things so were really focused on that we said that were going to invest in marketing that that was one area that we really hadnt done one of the key areas that we hadnt done we needed to and weve hired some great talent there we did that last year and we are so weve got those costs but weve also got some additional media that were going to be investing in and we need to and look i think weve been winning on account growth and growing the business and i think weve done it without kind of well well sort of with the marketing hand tied behind our back i think we get that out from behind our back is going to really help us so im optimistic about that and then the third one or the fourth one that we said were going to be investing in is it and cyber and thats the big number that jerry is talking about because we are as we looked at this and did our planning for this year we really call this a generational investment in it and its really id say around if i if youre interested id d break it down into say three areas one is customer experiences and growth which really revolve a lot around digital mobile for the consumer and commercial businesses we are almost doubling our number of digital agile teams were going from to of them in the commercial area were speeding up modernization on certain core cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 systems there are three of them we need a new loan system we need to invest in realtime payments which is a developing competitive issue and we need to take care of our check processing system which is at end of life we are a big correspondent bank provider so check yeah checks are going away but theyre not gone and we process a lot of them so thats probably in terms of that core modernization and then we need to continue to expand our efforts on ill call it information security and fraud mitigation thats probably the other and thats a big percentage increase weve increased it lets see weve been for and and it was up in we really backed down expenses all over the bank that year but in were looking for a increase in itrelated expenses and thats a generational investment in necessary it and i say its necessary because remember our success at competing and i believe were winning at the organic growth competition is from an empathetic customer service experience and from great technology and we cant sleep on that technology piece now having said all that i dont believe those are investments that were going to have to make at the same level as we look in the next year in so it is its a big number we hate spending money we hate wasting it even worse and so we dont think were doing that but we do need to do this to compete where we are and i think well see that run rate go down as we hit and beyond steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for all that color really appreciate it phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc welcome operator thank you the next question is coming from dave rochester of compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys just a quick one on the nii guide i was curious what the impact is you see for the rate hike in february and then the rate cut in july with the nim sensitivity is for those moves that youre baking in and it sounded like youre assuming a positive but maybe more muted deposit growth trend for the year i was just wondering if you could give an update on the total deposit beta assumption youre now baking into that thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right i guess ill just start with the deposit betas i mean i think we ended up the year kind of where we expected we would be we had said that wed be about on interestbearing and about to on total and thats really kind of where we ended up so i think for we were higher in the fourth quarter i think i said in the third quarter that i thought we have be a little bit more aggressive than we were but we ended up cumulatively exactly where we expected in the fourth quarter as far as betas for next year or for this year excuse i mean i think basically what were assuming is that we would have the same sort of increase that we had in the first quarter and february is kind of where wed go back i think were assuming a little bit more aggressive betas say where we were at about cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 on interestbearing i think were probably assuming right now that wed be somewhere closer to the to and then our assumptions are that we take all that back in july and well just have to see i think we said all along is we want to see kind of where the market is but those are our current assumptions today and i think you had one other question on the david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah just on the sensitivity to the rate moves that you guys are looking at the hike in february and then the cut in july how much that will you think will move the nim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah from a nim standpoint i dont think its going to have a significant impact on the percentage itself like i said i dont we want to be careful we dont really give all that sort of level detailed guidance but what i have said is i do think the percentage will peak in the third quarter just right before our projected decrease and i think that were feeling good about where were at a lot a lot of it will be dependent on what happens on those deposits as ive said yeah we do i feel like its a little bit more muted in than it was in yeah most certainly i mean i think we saw some of that just in the linkedquarter movement although a lot of it was moving into repo and so we had certain customers coming out of the money market account and choosing to move into the repo account because of some sort of operational processes and money flow issues that they that they liked more in the repo and also the fact that that product is collateralized so we did see some movement there so i tend to have less concerns although its still going to be relatively soft its going to be softer than we saw this year on the interestbearing side but most of the risk is on the commercial dda in my opinion as far as what we think a 25basispoint hike gives us it gives us about on a pretax basis a little over million a quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and maybe just one last quick one on the times debt service coverage ratio you gave on the office book thats an updated figure for todays rates is that right phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yes thats where we stand on average today david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave i just want to make sure when i said around a little over thats on an aftertax basis i couldnt remember if i said pretax or aftertax cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc all right sure operator thank you the next question is coming from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start with your comment about growing the bond portfolio i think on a net basis of about billion in right if you look at the amount of cash that frost still has at least on an average basis in the fourth quarter it was of average earning assets it feels like you could do potentially more than the billion adding to the bond book especially as the rates are more attractive today is there some possible upside to the amount of bonds that you will consider adding in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that yeah thats a possibility obviously right now what were really concerned with is its just making sure we understand exactly whats going on with deposits i guess what id say is that its something that were talking about should we get the opportunity if we think something we get an opportunity on the yield side with some sort of market correction we could jump in but so there is that possibility but i think right now were really the numbers that were giving is really kind of the way were modeling like i said its i never say never sort of thing but id go with our projections i dont expect lets not forget that in we spent billion i think gross and in that year we only had a little over billion we only had a little bit over million in inflows so net we spent billion so weve moved the needle quite a bit and so weve made some purchases already in the in january of this year of billion i think roughly so could we yeah i dont see that as a high probability at this point but yeah thats always a possibility given what happens in the market brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then my second question is on mortgage as that relatively new unit gets up and running for you guys i think thats an originated keep model not an originated sell model so is that business continues to mature do cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 you think that that will push the loan growth outlook beyond the highsingledigit just because youll have that new lever of loan growth as you keep those mortgages phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc good question brady i dont know if it goes above highsingle digits but it will be additive to it i dont really have it in my mind enough to know how much that would move the needle but yeah its going to be a significant part of the portfolio the way i hope it turns out is if you look five years out itd be 10ish percent of the portfolio back when we used to have them on the book before i think we were around that area of the portfolio so i just think directionally wed be in that same level so if you kind of took what would that be and what kind of volumes would that be you could sort of pencil out how much that might add to growth brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc okay operator thank you the next question is coming from manan gosalia morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon i had a quick followup on the expense side are these expenses that you have pretty much set in stone for or do you have some flexibility depending on which way the overall environment goes and then i also had a clarification on your comments on the run rate moving lower do you think that basically the growth rate moves lower off of the new expense base in as you go into or do you think as you get the new launch system and check processing system et cetera running and the old one rolls up that the actual dollars can stabilize or come down as you go into thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well my comments really werent intended to indicate that the dollars would come down because obviously were growing company were going to continue to invest my point is that i dont see us investing at the same level with some of these i mean for example i didnt mention it but take mortgage we have bootstrapped that operation we spent some serious money doing it its a fantastic product its going to be a tremendous product for us going forward but we dont have to rebuild that next year right so were going to have that same level of cost structure and itll be higher because of inflation and growth that kind of thing but were not going to have to bootstrap it so thats really what im pointing out i think were making a lot of these generational investments that were really going to be trying to harvest and well be dealing more with an increasing expense base but just not increasing at the same level that we have been thats my hope thats what were going to try to manage to cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right perfect and then a followup on the product questions on the securities book i guess even if you dont get a market correction opportunity to make larger purchases here given that weve come off the highs in yields what would change your strategy to maybe accelerate some of the investments in that securities book jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that if we felt like there was a correction that was significant that got our attention i think that we would accelerate that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and any thoughts on what once the fed begins to cut rates what your cash position should look like as a percentage of earning asset jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc its really not weve kind of been all over the board i think the thing is today weve got youre right weve got more liquidity than we have had i think that we feel comfortable being able to bring that down to something much more normalized but we dont have a number out there a lot of it is going to be dependent on what were seeing i think if youve got say something in the as far as earning assets are concerned something in the range of or lower i mean i think we could be at some point in that range manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator operator instructions the next question is coming from peter winter of da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon so you guys are always sitting on very strong capital ratios low credit risk i was just curious what your thought is on share buybacks i know its not a focus but what are your thoughts on share buybacks here jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah its really not something thats top of mind to be quite honest with you i think that right now we really dont even have one in place i think our we had million one that expired we expect that well bring that back into the toolbox here in the near future but we had one for all of we didnt utilize it weve got it primarily to ensure that if we did see some market correction on our stock that wed be in a position to take advantage of that but right now i think from a multiple standpoint i think we feel that that capital is better served through organic growth and i think there were some concerns not that we were concerned but i think the market had some cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 concerns about tangible capital and given that concern some of the questions we were getting i cant see that wed pull the trigger any time soon peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay and then just on office space phil i heard your comments most of your exposures to the atype properties but i was just wondering if you could comment what youre seeing on the b and c properties in like houston and dallas phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc it just there really arent many that have come to my radar portfolio wise that i know of thats going to because thats going to depend on sponsorship guarantees equity all those kinds of things right so but i can just tell you that what youre seeing all over the country is that the b and c properties just are hard to get people into and i can imagine there are some issues out there its i dont have anything thats more complex than that just recognition that people arent using as much office space and it better be nice if youre going to try to get employees to go into it peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks operator thank you the next question is coming from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i agree youve got to be nice to get people back thats a good comment just most of my questions were scratched off and peter just took one of them but you made a comment earlier phil about the prospect pipeline versus your own pipeline and the difference between the two can you just talk about that a little bit more and maybe thats more of a competitive environment question but help us understand them a little bit more thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 yeah we are getting lots of calls for deals right because weve got liquidity weve got consistent underwriting people know what we do in the marketplace and as far as that goes underwriting is tightening up its coming our way as far as guarantees and equity and all that kind of stuff but my point was and i should also say that we dont were not looking to do all those deals we bank people not things right and we bank relationships so but there might be some relationships that weve been wanting to have that well see the opportunity to do okay and were always on the lookout for that and now the phone rings more so we see prospect activity to me is more its more the advantage of us having the balance sheet that we do and reputation we do but my point on our customers to me its kind of like same store sales i know its not that but i mean you already have the customers and youre going to and the deals you have in the pipeline for them are the deals theyre looking to do their new deals theyre looking to do right theyre not necessarily deals that are out there that have already been papered already been that are in the marketplace that you might see with the prospect so my point is as i looked at it to me it was like okay our customers weve got their business if were not seeing new deals from them its because theyre not doing new deals and or theyre slower on them but we are still seeing good prospect deals that are out there in the marketplace just because of the advantages that we have is that maybe im off on that but thats jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc no phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thats what it meant to me jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats helpful and then just one other thing on the stepup and it and security expenses are you saying thats a permanent stepup or its just kind of modernization and core spendingrelated just for are we talking about a growth rate in expenses flowing in or expenses kind of flattening out and coming down in thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jon its growth rate its a growth rate coming down i mean once we bake this into our base expense load i mean its staying in there and therell be some growth on it because inflation and all those kind of things but its but we wont be having to do the same thing again our growth rate for four out of the last five years or three out of the last four years before this year has been so and it is a cost that is it used to be health care was the out of control cost i think its clearly it these days and but well need to get it back down to those more historical levels jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks guys cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 operator thank you were
