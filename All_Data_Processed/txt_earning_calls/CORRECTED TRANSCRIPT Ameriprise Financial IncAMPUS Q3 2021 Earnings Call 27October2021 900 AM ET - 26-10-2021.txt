favorably across the industry and our retirement protection business is valuable and high quality generating good free cash flow and returns its entirely focused on our channel and differentiated from anything else out there listen were generating some of the strongest returns in the industry and have been for quite some time and were able to do it with lower volatility importantly weve returned capital to shareholders at very attractive levels in fact we consistently return nearly all of our operating earnings to shareholders annually and if you look at that over the last five years we reduced our average weighted diluted share count by this is all while were consistently investing in the business and maintaining a sizable excess capital position that gives us flexibility in closing

management representing about of earnings retirement protection performed well and we remain focused on optimizing our risk return tradeoffs in this environment we generate robust free cash flow across all our businesses our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent with significant excess capital combined this allows ameriprise to consistently return substantial capital to shareholders with of adjusted operating earnings returned in the quarter putting us on track to achieve our target for the full year lets turn to slide six we are focused on growth in our core wealth and asset management businesses and we hit some important milestones this quarter we are seeing excellent aum growth of to trillion on flows and markets flows in these businesses have improved substantially up over from a year ago and up ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 nearly on a yeartodate basis representing the successful execution of our growth strategies in each of these businesses lets turn to slide seven where you can see that we are delivering profitable organic growth revenues in wealth and asset management grew to nearly billion with pretax operating earnings of million up importantly earnings growth from wealth and asset management outpaced revenue growth demonstrating the operating leverage of the business and the blended margin for these two businesses expanded basis points from last year with wealth management up basis points and asset management up basis points further illustrating our ability to deliver profitable growth turning to slide this chart clearly illustrates our success executing our growth and business mix shift strategy specifically the wealth and asset management businesses are driving about of the earnings over the past months this is coupled with a stable million contribution from retirement protection solutions with that as an overview lets review the individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on slide the strategies we have in place to support advisors and improve their productivity using integrated industry leading tools technology and training has resulted in increased flows and transactional activity total client assets were up over to billion over the past two years our advisor force continued to deliver exceptional productivity growth across market cycles revenue per advisor reached a new high of in the quarter up over the past two years importantly over the past two years the annualized organic growth rate for wealth management flows improved to compared to in this is coming from advisors penetrating their existing client base and adding new clients complemented by recruiting experienced advisors and we are pleased that our strategies are translating to this level of organic growth on page you can see that we are delivering growth as well as excellent financial results in wealth management in fact revenue and earnings for wealth management also reached record levels this quarter adjusted operating net revenues grew to over billion fueled by robust client flows a increase in transactional activities and market appreciation wealth management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased to million ameriprise bank is adding to the growth from wealth management primarily by allowing us to pick up incremental spread and cash sweep deposits in total the bank has nearly billion of assets after moving an additional billion of sweep cash on to our balance sheet in the quarter in the quarter the average spread on the bank assets was basis points compared to offbalance sheet cash earnings of basis points in addition we are seeing good growth in banking products including pledge lending that has gained substantial traction with our advisor base since the product was launched in the fourth quarter of expenses remain well managed ga expense increased as higher activity based expenses and performance based compensation were largely offset by expense discipline in the quarter our pretax adjusted operating margin was an increase of basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially lets turn to asset management on slide where significant success is also being realized over the past two years asset under management increased we also saw a net flow shift from outflows in to a growth rate this year as jim mentioned we are seeing positive flows across both retail and institutional distribution channels supported by excellent investment performance and like the industry we saw a bit of a slowdown during the summer months though our relative position among our peers remain strong the operating leverage in asset management is significant with margins for the trailing months up up basis points over the last two years ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 turning to page you see these trends generated excellent financial performance in asset management adjusted operating revenues increased to million a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows market depreciation and performance fees on a sequential basis revenues grew importantly our fee rate remained strong and stable at basis points expenses remained well managed and in line with expectations giving you revenue growth ga expenses were up primarily from compensation expense and other variable costs related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation pretax adjusted operating earnings grew to million and we delivered a margin moving forward we expect strong financial performance to continue and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid40 range over the near term driven by the continued flow momentum and equity markets at these levels as jim mentioned we are on track to close the bmo emea transaction in the fourth quarter this acquisition will add significant capabilities from a strategic perspective and drive improved business fundamentals going forward lets turn to page retirement protection solutions continued to reflect excellent underlying business performance differentiated risk profile and a continued generation of substantial free cash flow pretax adjusted operating earnings were million excluding unlocking down from million a year ago current year results reflect lower profitability from increased sales levels whereas results in the prior year benefited from lower sales as well as lower surrenders and withdrawals in total unlocking impacts in the quarter were immaterial resulting from consistent client behavior and interest rates that were in line with prior year estimates we saw a strong pickup in sales of retirement protection products in the quarter with a continued mix shift towards nonguaranteed retirement products during the quarter the variable annuity sales increased from last year with of sales and products without living benefit guarantees account value with living benefits represent only of the overall book now down another basis points in the past year we had similar trends in protection with sales up driven by higher margins vul sales this mix in sales and indiscernible for both retirement protection products are expected to continue additionally in the appendix of this presentation we have provided our annual update on longterm care business you will observe that the business continues to perform in line with expectations from a claims perspective the policy count continues to decline as the book ages and we are garnering additional premium rate increases now approximately of the book has extensive or substantial credible experience and i will note that we did not incorporate recent improvements in mortality and morbidity related to covid19 into our longterm assumptions overall our actual performance continues to be in line with expectations lets turn to slide in the quarter you have seen transactions announced in insurance and annuity space in light of these announcements i felt it will be helpful to provide additional context as it relates to how we view our business as jim has indicated we believe our ia business is a highly valuable asset with a client solution driven capability that has generated sustainable and predictable financial results and free cash flow generation coupled with a low risk profile the driver of this is our prudent approach in building all aspects of this business resulting in a proven track record of superior value creation the behavior of our clients has been consistent reflecting the nature of the product sale as part of the financial plan we have taken a conservative approach to product features including guarantees and credit rates as well as requiring asset allocation for living benefits we have maintained consistent sales level and industry market share over the last decade avoiding the arms race seen from time to time in the industry and our economic hedging program has performed well across market cycles with effectiveness over the past five years finally we have taken prudent and appropriate actions to manage the risk profile of the business for example we stopped sales of ltc in and have successfully implemented premium rate actions and increased protection with our ltc reinsurance partner we also sold our ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 auto home business reinsured our fixed annuity businesses and have reduced living benefit sales this consistent and prudent approach has resulted in a stable earnings with margins and a pretax return on capital exceeding with consistent free cash flow generation our balance sheet fundamentals are strong with a highquality investment portfolio and strong riskbased capital ratio this performance is bestinclass in the industry over many years we have demonstrated superior return on capital dividends paid and capital ratios and our net amount at risk is substantially lower than peers in summary this is a very valuable business and we are wellpositioned it is now only of our earnings we have demonstrated that the exposure profile is well managed and we completed our annual unlocking with very minor updates with that being said we will continue to evaluate options from a position of strength to make the best decisions to drive all aspects of shareholder value creation now lets move to the balance sheet another area we have delivered strong results our balance sheet fundamentals and risk management capability are cornerstones of what we do it starts with how we manage the business to generate substantial free cash flow in each of our segments we had holding company available liquidity of billion and excess capital of billion at the end of the quarter we prudently manage credit risk where we maintain an overall aa minus credit quality in our investment portfolio and have a highly effective hedge strategy these strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders as i mentioned we returned of earnings to shareholders in the quarter and we are on track to hit our target for the full year we have executed our capital return consistently over the years our share count declined over the past five years even with issuing shares to fund sharebased compensation programs over the past year alone the share count declined in summary strong fundamentals across our businesses deliver substantial free cash flow we manage the balance sheet conservatively and we have substantial liquidity and capital flexibility combined these attributes position us to continue delivering a differentiated level of capital return to shareholders going forward with that we will take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from steven chubak from wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good morning jim walter hope you are both doing well i wanted to start off with a question and maybe a multipart question just on the bank growth strategy given continued strong growth at the bank up roughly yearonyear as we look out over the next three to five years what pace of growth should we be underwriting where do you see the bank levels getting to on a more steadystate basis and just given the meaningful gap between you and peers in terms of loan penetration and the strong demand for a pledge loan product that you mentioned what do you see as an achievable loan penetration rate or target over the longterm walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay so with the bank as you noticed and we have certainly grown the underlying assets in the bank we will continue to do that we have the capability for our overall cash strategy to switch from off balance sheet to on balance sheet and certainly manage our effective yield on that basis and give us alternatives so we do see we have a substantial room to grow as we take deposits right now they are in the billion range to be increasing that by at least billion to billion as we move forward into the years and evaluate the situation it gives us certainly a yield pickup from that standpoint and gives diversity as it relates to the underlying assets we are seeing tremendous success as we look at our pledge loan activity and margin loan activity which of course is in the broker dealer and the ph over actives we are investing to build that and we will see a significant penetration capability with that as the uplift has taken place since december when we launched the pledge loans it has been very good and certainly the other products that joe and his team are working on steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great im recognizing its a multiyear endeavor just curious given some of your peers have loan penetration rates around to of aum do you view that as a credible longterm target for ameriprise as well walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes we do steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay great and just for my followup on organic growth sustainability certainly encouraging to see you maintain that annualized organic growth rate also saw some improving trends in the employee channel as well as better momentum in afig i was hoping you could speak to whats driving that improved advisor adds both in the employee channel as well as the financial institution channel and just given those improving trends how that informs your confidence level on the sustainability of that mid singledigit organic growth rate ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so this is jim so first and foremost the organic growth rate that weve been getting we feel very good about based on how were penetrating our own client base today how were enhancing and deepening the relationships through our advice modules and the support that were giving the advisors with our tools and capabilities that really helped arm them engage the clients more fully so we feel like what weve made as good investments there training and development is really starting to show its fruits in regard to the external recruitment that has picked up again which we did as we moved from the virtual back to inperson were seeing good advisors join us good quality books and we feel like we have a good opportunity as people better understand the type of capabilities that we offer the brand support that we provide as well as the recognition that were getting there from a client perspective for trust in regard to our brand and thats very important we see that both in the advisor employee channel the franchisee but as well in the afig channel as you know it took us a little while to integrate that into our platforms and capabilities and now we are actually adding new bank partners and adding advisors to those partners and so thats actually taking shape kind of nicely for us and we think theres a good growth path left forward on that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color thank you both for taking my questions operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc good morning and thank you for taking my questions my first question is on the ga expenses in awm and asset management the overall expenses continue to surprise on the lower side especially for awm the growth was less than yearoveryear and actually down quarteroverquarter i understand that the lack of travel and the delay in returning to the office was a factor but organic growth activities were very strong so it seems like the expense management continue to yield very good benefits just how should we think about the ga expenses will trend going forward i think in the past you talked about to growth rates but why isnt that too conservative walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc the to is a good number from our standpoint certainly we do believe that we are managing expenses well and certainly making investments but as you indicated certainly te expenses and other things have not exactly returned but we do see that certainly coming back into more steady state but the and would be a good number in my mind humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc got it and then in terms of asset management so retail flows were very good in the us but the emea flows continue to be a little bit weak you talked about seeing some improvement since the second quarter can you just talk about what youre seeing in that market and what can you do to drive that forward and then what do you expect when the flows in emea will look like once the bmo acquisition is closed ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so this is jim if we look at the wholesale flows in emea theyve actually were positive and been maintaining a bit more positive over the course of the year the uk was the area that even though it has improved so it was still in a bit of an outflow it did improve over the last two quarters and as you would imagine the uk went through a bit more of a lockdown in the summer months theyre still working through some of their issues regarding brexit et cetera just completing how that looks and how people should think about investing but we actually see that with the economy starting to bounce back the pandemic starting to get a bit less impactful that we should start to see a bit more pick up there but that was the weak spot in emea but overall it did improve over the course of the year now on the institutional side weve seen good inflows in emea and in certain of the mandates as well as in the uk weve gotten a big mandate there as well so we see the institutional being a little firmer in that regard versus the wholesaler intermediate at this point humphrey lee q analyst dowling partners securities llc thats great thank you for the answers operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys thanks for the question i want to go back to the discussion around the retirement business obviously you guys kind of provided more details and tried to kind of showcase the quality of the business should we read that as sort of reaffirmation of your commitment to the business or the fact that look its actually a great business indiscernible with somebody else and as a threshold for us to think about you highlight plus roe over three years in that business how should we i guess think of that as a sort of a metric for us to think about like would you need to see to part with that business james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so alex its an excellent question and we figured that by giving you more information someone would read something into it different than someone else so let me try to clarify that and what we try to do there weve seen the transactions as walter said come out to market and people starting to realize that our book is a bit better than what theyve seen out there and very clearly we think it is significantly better in that regard the business is less than of our total today it is very well managed it generates very strong returns and cash flows and so the first thing i would convey to you as an investor and as an analyst is that it does not detract from our business it provides the level of diversity it actually gives us strong cash flows that we use for buyback as a complement to free cash flows we generate in the other businesses so it doesnt in any way have a draw on capital and that its been very steady and consistent with excellent returns on the overall capital thats deployed there so one thing we would bring to highlight is as we hold the business it should not be a discount or an overhang on us is the first thing the second thing we would clearly say just like weve sold the auto home we reinsured part of the book weve diverted our sales from activities that dont give us really good strong returns were very open to continue to explore strategic opportunities with the book either reinsurance of aspects or even the sale of certain of the businesses or total ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 but as long as it makes sense from a strategic perspective supports our clients and we can generate reasonable value for that we think its a good operating business its really a great clientoriented business it really has great distribution capabilities as part of our solution set so it might be a great opportunity strategically for us to evaluate but we wanted to be clear that this is not a discounted book that we must get rid of for whatever reason because it doesnt detract from us and in fact it shouldnt be a discount to the business today as we hold it but if someone was or we evaluated strategically it made sense i would tell you its a valued business that should be of a valued price alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right loud and clear thanks for that my followup is around the asset management business we saw that columbia is dividendcomplaint i think had a soft close in the third quarter this has been a really big contributor to the overall organic growth within asset management can you just spend maybe a minute on what the soft close really means in this context sort of if you were to go back over the last months and say hey if the product was soft closed back then any kind of way to frame how much of a flow headwind this could create but also in the same context maybe spend a minute on how the business may have been diversified a little bit more so to what extent should we really worry about this product soft closing james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would not worry about it weve been in sort of a soft close over the course of the year what that really means is we still take additions to accounts that are already there retail and institutional which is still a good flow its just that we dont go out and sell to new clients to add new mandates to it and since we have a really good book with the amount of incremental flows that come in from that book anyway it still continues to be nice accretive on the other side to the point that you raised we have been able to really diversify our mix and so over the course of the year again we have more than different disciplines that are adding over billion of flows too so we feel really good about the diversification and what may still be in income products if thats where people are interested versus as well our fixed income businesses growing nicely with different types of investments there as well as some of the other equity products have also been gaining traction so we feel like our lineup is pretty diversified now and each of what were selling actually has excellent performance alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks very much operator our next question comes from brennan hawken from ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions really encouraging and great to see the good fundamentals in awm and the tick up there in fa head count this year i guess it seemed like from your comments that you think the growth is sustainable so just would like to confirm that thats your view but also could you maybe give some additional perspective on your approach to recruiting where do you think you might stand versus your primary competitors in the marketplace as far as competitiveness of packages is concerned and is there may be a willingness to step up if you guys are conservative maybe approach the market a bit more so you could drive a bit more of that head count growth thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we feel very good about the continuation our ability to continue to get good flows in the business and have good client activity and relationships both from a client as well as with the advisor uptake of our capabilities and the same thing with recruiting i think we really do have a really strong value proposition to offer advisors the biggest thing that we try to do is educate advisors versus what people are selling out there of what we offer more completely and comprehensively and we think it is very differentiated we think that it really helps an advisor really improve their productivity and drive a really good strong practice and so thats really what we focus on now part of that is the package financial for someone to transition et cetera we think that we offer competitive packages there we dont get overly aggressive less some that will sort of buy the business per se we look at the economics of that i want to make sure that it is reasonable and appropriate to cycle but we feel that the offering is competitive and when you add that to the totality of what we provide and the support we think its excellent value so thats the way we look to compete in the marketplace and we feel good about that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thank you for that and then followingup on some of stevens questions around the growth in the bank curious clearly the bank saw a nice uptick in yields here this quarter and thats really probably before you even saw some benefit from rates given how it happened late in the quarter and so clearly an attractive economic proposition how do you think about the possibility to perhaps even accelerate the deposit growth in the bank and when we think about this ultimately as a strategic driver of better economics in awm how do you think about where the bank would break down as far as proportion or mix of the deposits i mean i would think it should be the majority but how are you guys thinking about it over these next few years walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes so i would say we actually reentered the banking business because we felt consistent with what you said that it was a good strategic opportunity for us to complement our business in the marketplace clearly we have some experience going back on that and we absolutely did the business nicely at that point in time and as you recollect the bank is kind of new right now so were just sort of ramping up were putting the products to market et cetera and we think that we have a good growth trajectory of moving more deposits over we think that the margins in that business could be really good i mean its been a compressed spread market right now thats starting to open up a bit as we get down the road which i think will be favorable for us to continue to do the shift and we are launching more of the lending products in the bank and some more deposit gathering products in the bank as well for our retail clients now with that it will continue to take time to develop those books but we see a really good traction in the ones weve launched already well be bringing more lending activities back on balance sheet over time for mortgages and home equities and other things like that so we do have our plans going out and i think it will be a great complement to the business brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure but is there any idea or aspiration or indication around proportional size of the bank versus the other options like that ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc i think from a movement of off balance sheet to balance sheet that will become the majority of where the deposits go so thats exactly to your point yes as far as the lending penetration again as we increase the number of different products we put out there for what were going to penetrate thats what were working on now but we feel like we can get some good penetration based on some of our past experience of what we worked with partners on brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sounds great thanks so much for the color operator our next question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co can you talk maybe about some of the flow synergies for the bmo emea asset management transaction and the backdrop of strong flows for columbias thread needle maybe the opportunity in the us that the transaction provides walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes so well hopefully be able to close this in short order over the next few weeks were just waiting for one more regulatory approval and once we have that on the books we can start to give you more information on it as you would imagine with privacy and other things in the european market thats been one that we cant really get into even though some of the indiscernible but from the actual sales activity that theyve been garnering over the last number of quarters even though this transaction was done has been very positive and favorable so there have been nice inflows there and that bodes well for us to assume the business and so we think that that can continue we like a lot of their capabilities that were already thinking about how we would integrate that in and carry some of those capabilities not just across our european business but actually into the us and from a us perspective we think that a number of the us assets are going to transfer over to us weve been working as a clientbyclient approval and activities but that looks very favorable and well be able to give you more information as we get closer to the end of the year john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co great thanks operator our next question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 hey good morning just staying on the bmo emea transaction i think its a million plus layout of capital do you have an appetite to do any more transactions and where might that be james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so we actually want to focus right now in the international market of closing and integrating in the bmo transaction we have good plans to do that and leverage that capability working with the people there we think that they add good complementary investment processes and people and capabilities and thats our first order of business having said that as we have said we have flat capital flexibility if something else comes along that would be complementary that fits we would definitely look to explore it having said that were not out in search of something to do right now but you never know when opportunities may arise but if were looking at the european part of that equation were really focused on that integration andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc i see and if something were to come your way any particular areas of note that you would strongly consider james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well again what were continuing to do is look at what could be complementary in either distribution or product capability some of the maybe alternative space or solutions but again we feel like we got a pretty good makeup and what bmo actually provides is a complement to the areas that we wanted to further invest in and so thats why again it would have to be really opportunistic rather than that were in the hunt for something that we need right now andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and then just and maybe i missed this in the emea conversations and you talked about flows exceeding your expectations which is quite promising but at some point there would have to be some breakage could you give us a sense of how much breakage we might expect over the next year or two in the bmo emea operations james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well as you would imagine any time we go into a transaction or deal not knowing we always factor in a level of breakage et cetera and still feel very good about the arrangement that weve made and adding it to our equation having said that we feel like from what we know today that looks less negative and more positive than what we always initially assumed but again its early stages but i think whats important is that this will be complementary to us were not integrating and consolidating investment processes and people were adding them were keeping everything in tow as it is to really support clients the way theyve been supported add those processes and investment professionals through our capability and we also feel like we can add some further support to what theyve done in emea to complement their business that would be very helpful for their clients so we feel very positive at this stage as we get further into it of course well always give you that provide you that color andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 operator our next question comes from ryan krueger from kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning given the rbc ratio at riversource right now following the fixed annuity deal do you plan to take higher than normal dividends up to the holding company this year and work that back down to a more typical level james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes the short answer is yes obviously with the transaction on the fixed annuities that created that situation so we will be adjusting that ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks and then just one followup on riversource i guess in recent quarters youve talked about receiving inbound interest in riversource from third parties can you just give a little bit of an update on that and in particular i guess are you receiving interest from strategic buyers or just financial buyers james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc its been the multiple of it and they are continuing certainly as it relates to as youve seen the activity in the quarter so its on both sides of it ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator our next question comes from kenneth lee from rbc capital markets kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question just one on the asset management side the operating margins were very strong just wondering was it simply case of operating leverage or were there any other particular drivers that youd call out thanks walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no the operating leverage in the margins have been quite strong and that certainly again weve targeted to its been running in the mid40s that is certainly a factor of market situations which we expect will continue if the markets indiscernible kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc got you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and just one followup if i may wondering if we could just delve a little bit more into the organic growth improvements youre seeing within the advice wealth management side wonder if you could just outline what you think were the main contributors in that increase in growth rate over the past two years and do you think that we could still see similar rates improvement going forward thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes i think we feel very good about the growth rates and the continuation and we feel a lot dont get me wrong the markets are good but we feel a lot has to do because youve seen a nice uplift from where we were based upon the integrated technology and the solution and the advice modules weve been put into market that really help the advisors engage a larger part of their client base and deepen appropriately we also have added a lot of capabilities for them in our crm systems et cetera to reach out to even more prospects and move up market more and so were seeing a combination of things that are adding to that total flow picture but whats really important is the level of client and advisor engagement on things and so we think that that has given us that level of uplift kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great very helpful thanks again operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore isi thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning just a followup on potential risk transfer so from what were seeing and hearing it looks like pretty attractive pricing on whats the majority of your business which would be variable annuities and life insurance but less so we hear the market for longterm care transactions is pretty challenged and obviously you havent had a deal on that market for quite some time is one option for you retaining longterm care and selling the rest of your business and if so would that be a tough deal to structure or is that doable walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well listen theres a lot of options coming in as we talk about it is youre correct the ltc is certainly evolving at a slow pace than the others but the good thing about it is the strength of what we believe is our position with that business so yes we could structure something of that nature but right now i dont want to get into speculation of it but the good thing about it is its performing the way we thought it would and we feel comfortable with it thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 thanks for that walter and then just a followup the one i kind of agree with everything you have on your slide in terms of the well say the positive attributes of your business relative to some of the other businesses that have been sold probably the most unique aspect is your distribution and i think the generally better margins and lower risk do you think if something does evolve here that you would get paid something in addition for that distribution and if so is there any way to think about that james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc tom again youre right on point i mean we actually have one of the best channels if you want to sell a longer term solution and the capability there is there for someone that really wants to continue to be in the business in a good way and based on the type of offering our clients look for reasonable appropriate benefits reasonable appropriate pricing and consistency of delivery so yes it would be probably if someones in this business its probably one of the best channels for them to access thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks jim operator our next question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research hi thank you just one more followup on the rps i think in the slide you highlight the very strong cash flow from this block which has been over of gaap earnings and its a lot higher than peers so just wondering whats allowing you to generate this level of cash flow and is this a sustainable level moving forward if you hold sales and flows roughly stable walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah it is and certainly we feel as you look at weve been maintaining our rbc ratio it is certainly the quality of the book and the cash flows within them so we feel very confident with the capital requirements looking at it from a ph stat standpoint that this is a sustainable proposition obviously theres been ins and outs related to other aspects such as auto home and other things of that nature but on a regular steadystate basis yes its in the range erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it so you think of it as sort of a free cash flow conversion ex kind of the reinsurance deals that youve done in the past walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc in a range yeah erik bass q analyst autonomous research ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 got it thank you operator we have no further questions at this
