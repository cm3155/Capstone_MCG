common equity in the second quarter tangible book value per share also grew by quarter overquarter and yearoveryear and lastly im pleased to announce that east west bank has once again been selected

chris to provide more details on our second quarter financial performance chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you dominic turning to loans on slide end of period loans grew quarteroverquarter with overall growth in line with our expectations ci growth was driven by notable increases in entertainment lending and overall ci utilization levels however our growth came very late in the second quarter we expect ci to continue to grow over the back half of the year but likely at a more moderate pace residential mortgage production was consistent and our pipeline levels remained strong going into q3 we expect residential mortgage will continue to be a growth driver at present levels in commercial real estate we saw healthy growth in multifamily in q2 offset by declines in the remainder of the cre portfolio we are continuing to work with our longstanding clients but foresee very modest cre loan growth for us for the balance of moving on to deposits on slide we grew end of period deposits by to a new record level of billion with growth coming across all of our customer groups q2 marks the fourth consecutive quarter of billionplus customer growth reflecting our focus on full relationships notably our end of period noninterestbearing deposit mix remained stable at pushing the margin slide covers our margin and net interest income trends second quarter dollar net interest income totaled million while our net interest margin was as expected nim compression for the quarter reflected higher overall deposit and funding costs partially offset by improving mostly fixed rate asset yields as we move through the second half of the year we expect nim to grind marginally lower before bottoming out nonetheless increasing asset growth is expected to drive growing dollar nii through the back half of the year slide summarizes our noninterest income trends we achieved a record level of fee income million this quarter up million or from the prior quarter with growth in every fee category i think that says a lot with that let me turn the call over to irene irene h oh executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc thank you chris and good afternoon to all on the call east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 on slide credit trends remain stable and the asset quality of our portfolio remains strong as dominic mentioned earlier we reported net chargeoffs in the second quarter of million or basis points annualized compared to million or basis points annualized in the first quarter of quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets rose by basis points to basis points of total assets primarily due to increases from ci loans and commercial real estate loans we have foreclosed on nonetheless the absolute level of nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets remains relatively low and at manageable levels criticized loans decreased during the quarter by driven by decreases in both special mention and substandard loans the special mention loan ratio decreased basis points quarteroverquarter to of loans and the classified loans ratio has decreased basis points to we recorded a higher provision for credit losses of million in the second quarter compared with million for the first quarter with regards to commercial real estate loan maturities as of june of outstanding balances are scheduled to mature by the end of and of outstanding balances will mature in for office loans specifically of outstanding balances will mature in and will mature in we remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risk based on what we know today we continue to expect quarterly net charge offs to be in the range of basis points to basis points for the foreseeable future turning to slide the total allowance for loan losses increased million quarteroverquarter driven by the expected economic outlook and also loan growth during the quarter resulting in allowance for loan losses coverage ratio of within commercial real estate we increased the reserve for office loans by million bringing the total coverage ratio to of office loans we believe our loan portfolio is appropriately reserved as of june turning to slide all of east west regulatory capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements for wellcapitalized institutions and well above regional bank averages east west common equity tier capital ratio stands at a robust while our tangible common equity ratio is at these capital ratios place us among the most wellcapitalized banks in the industry east west repurchased  of common stock during the second quarter or approximately million at an average price under a share we currently have million of repurchase authorization that remains available for future buybacks east west third quarter dividend will be payable on august to stockholders of record on august i will now turn it back to chris to share our outlook for the full year chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you irene our full year outlook remains largely unchanged from the first quarter we are still assuming the forward curve as of this quarter end and currently expect that first rate cut in september we continue to expect full year end of period loan growth in the range of to we expect full year net interest income to decline in the range of to we also continue to expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase in the range of to regarding tax items we now expect for the effective tax rate to be lower in the range of to versus the prior range of to we also now expect full year tax credit amortization expense to be within the range of million to million east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 with that i will now open the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i want to start on fee income you guys had highlighted this earlier you had a solid quarter there with some pretty broadbased growth so i was hoping you could talk about what youre expecting for that trajectory in the back half or what youre thinking for the full year in terms of growth overall christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure so weve had about full year yearoveryear growth through the midpoint when i think about the core drivers of that obviously deposit account fees are the biggest component and thats also been growing at that same pace and its been growing call it in the range of million a quarter i dont know if that will continue in a declining rate environment immediately but it should bode well going for another quarter or so lending fees are a function of lending growth i think weve commented that we expect lending to moderate over the back half of the year so i would expect thats the case and derivatives goes along with lending to a certain extent fx has been a wonderful piece of our business thats contributed greatly this quarter it does have some volatility and the wealth management fees which have grown very nicely have obviously been benefiting from the backdrop of positive overall equity markets and a strong fixed income yield opportunity again that will probably moderate to some extent as we look over the back half of the year david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay so all in maybe a little bit of moderation but still looking for some decent growth there it sounds like christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc its a core focus of us to drive overall fee income levels higher over time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 okay maybe appreciate that maybe its my followup on capital last quarter i know you were talking about a target tce ratio range around where it is right now any changes to the thinking on that and should we expect that range for at least the back half of the year christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think we continue to believe its not in our or shareholders interest for us to warehouse additional capital beyond these levels obviously itll bounce around a few basis points but were trying to be thoughtful about managing that in the best interest of returns david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys operator the next question comes from jared shaw with barclays capital please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc maybe just looking or starting with margin and taking into account the strong growth that you just pointed out in ci at the end of the quarter as well as maybe some of the dynamics around potentially getting to the end of a deposit remix pressure how should we be thinking about margin over the next few quarters with that backdrop christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah we still expect margin to have some downward compression over the back half of the year not sure if the trough will come in q3 or q4 but we think it does trough later this year that having been said while we think margin will come down a bit we do see dollar nii growing precisely because the balances grew here in the second quarter and we still see incremental growth although at a more moderate pace in the third and fourth quarters so balance sheet growth will keep the nii moving higher nim will still see compression and we expect that to trough as we get later in the year jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and is that margin compression i guess coming more from just some tail on funding costs or are you not getting maybe the same spreads on the incremental ci loan as you have in maybe the existing portfolio east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think we expect some downward compression on fixed rate assets as the expectation for fed cut comes into play and so the higher yields for example that weve been earning here more recently on mortgages will start to come down and some other fixed rate options as well as fixed rate investments those will put incremental downward pressure on the fixed rate asset repricing at the same time we dont think the fed cut which probably wont come until midseptember will do much to dampen the nearterm deposit costing that we have to roll over here in the third quarter so youll recall we had a fairly significant first quarter lunar new year cd campaign where were out there today growing deposits and managing that but its not at basis points or basis points lower level because rates havent really moved that far down jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right great thanks and then maybe as my followup just on credit any color around sort of the dynamic with ci npls up but criticized down any broader trends there or are those more oneoff christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah i would say i mean obviously those levels theyre off very low basis so there are loans that were looking at and borrowers that were looking at carefully for ci and then also cre as well but there is nothing i would say thats systemic at this point industry concentrations regions or anything where were overly concerned about jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks operator the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good afternoon everyone dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc afternoon indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc so i guess another followup on the nim so if we do get this trough in the back half of the year like what is the expectation if the forward curve plays out as is is it nim stability with cd repricing benefits and maturing hedges offsetting the the pressure you feel on the floating rate loan book just a little color on what happens post second half here east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah so order of magnitude i think weve said that for every basis point rate cut we would assume thered be something in the neighborhood of million to maybe million of downward pressure from the rate cuts but weve also said we expect about a deposit beta baked into those numbers so i think those are two things that are in play in our forward look with both of those assumptions baked in given the growth that we see ahead of us we think the answer is rising dollar nii fairly consistently third quarter into the fourth and margin coming down again modestly from current levels down into a slightly lower range and then finding its footing and we assume moving higher particularly as a number of negative cash flow hedges that currently weigh on us come off in the first quarter of casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just the loan growth outlook it sounds like you guys i mean obviously the cre you guys are holding the line on that near term and enjoying the ci and resi growth but it sounds as if you are looking to open that up or get reengage in commercial real estate in unless im misreading that but just wondering where cre concentration whats the strategy there like when can you turn that back on is there a certain level christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc well to be clear were always here for our core customers and were always engaged to support them we just havent been pursuing marginal new transactions and so we will continue to engage with our core customers and service our portfolios and help them with whatever comes their way with regard to the overarching loan strategy i think dominic has articulated a longterm plan to get to a third a third a third and that will involve us growing our ci and residential portfolios over time at a faster clip than cre dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i just want to add one additional comment here is that its not like that we are looking for marginal business in the past and now were not its really coming back to the issue is that our core customers indiscernible see a lot of very interesting activity for them to engage in so our volume on cre have dropped a lot has no that is simply because of the fact that there are just not a lot of great deals out there so we expect cre activities will probably continue to slow simply because of the external environment factor and so our position is that we always have the capital and the balance sheet to support our core customers in any kind of economic environment but for them to be our core customers that worthy of support they obviously are the people that are very savvy and know what theyre doing and so they wouldnt be foolishly getting involved in transaction that dont make sense so thats why the volume of ci to cre et cetera very much tie into to a certain extent interest rate environment and also the economic circumstances and so thats how we see utilization in ci also relatively low for the last couple of years simply because indiscernible this kind of interest rate is high for people to draw down because the cost of borrowing is so much higher so allinall i think that thats the beauty of having strong capital and strong balance sheet and be in the position to always take good care of our customers these good customers in turn will continue to take care of us east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc maybe for us first one just chris on like slide so you saw some mix shift from cash into securities during the quarter is that kind of steady state just remind us one when we think about securities to earning assets are we where we want to be and then in terms of the level of cash you want to be holding is the billion related to the billion the right sort of level to think about christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah and i think we said last quarter we thought the overall cash and securities and we kind of look at that as one basket would stay relatively stable relative to total balance sheet and i think thats certainly happened on an average basis the amount that can be invested i think from a variety of factors probably doesnt come down a lot after the billion in cash component but could come down a little bit more we certainly have the bandwidth and flexibility to do that but were not pushing that where again our focus is on core customer activity core loan growth core deposit growth and i think that will shape most of the change in the balance sheet over the back half of the year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just the other one maybe dominic for you just sentiment among your commercial customers as you think about maybe getting a september rate card youre going to get to the elections do you see those being a trigger where we could see an acceleration in loan growth and loan demand like do you feel there is some pentup demand that could lead to a rebound in sort of loan growth looking into and is the beginning of the rate cut cycle and elections enough to do that dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well based on the current expectation on the rate cuts i wouldnt think that the rate cut would be sort of like significant enough that can really move that much of a needle the fact is a basis point cut here and there i mean even if we do it two to three times its less than and when were sitting at indiscernible rate i dont think thats material enough to really drive a lot of excitement in terms of making investment and whatnot and then also election is something no one knows right now i mean theres a lot of drama going on so well just all have to watch it and see how it goes and then to see how would that affect business sentiment but at this stage right now my expectation is still going to be that everything stays more or less the same here its like maybe its exactly what the fed is driving in soft lending i think thats what it looks like its going in that direction so far business seems to be holding up pretty good but no ones going out there trying to aggressively east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 chase new business at this point and i expect thats going to be the way it is for the fourth quarter and possibly even the first quarter and then well see well see how election may affect policy and so forth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good thank you operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good evening christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good evening brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so from what i understand residential is going to lead loan growth in the back half of the year so could you just talk about what youre seeing in that category as far as demand i know theres concerns about housing supply i know you have a unique product but just give us some context behind your outlook indiscernible driving growth for the back half of the year and how sensitive that could be to interest rate moves and other things thanks christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah and let me just make sure were clear residential growth will continue to be a consistent contributor to the growth at about the pace its been here over the first half of the year into the second half of the year our pipelines already here in the third quarter would support that we dont see that necessarily shifting much in our outlook ci will be as was this quarter is a prominent contributor to the quarter it will moderate but it could also still be a good contributor to the overall growth we do have a unique product offering and one way to think about it is most of our borrowers are only borrowing on the dollar and so by definition theyre sort of as rate sensitive as your typical ltv borrower and therefore we have not seen the same downdraft in overall origination activities and we think that will hold here as dominic mentioned we dont think a rate cut or two will make too much difference to the outlook and those people that are coming to us pursuing the american dream of homeownership are not going to be turned away or more excited necessarily by give or take basis points brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it okay and then in regards to the nim commentary i think you briefly mentioned kind of cd repricing particularly the lunar new year deposits could you just give us some context behind what youre expecting as far as cd repricing in the back half of the year and how dependent that is on rate cuts or not east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah the bulk of the lunar cd pricing or the cd pricing driver in the first quarter was at a rate of ph our current special offerings today are at ph and and we therefore expect that we will be able to reprice somewhat lower but thats also a function of all of that coming through and most of that activity is sort of february into march so the proof will be in august and into september when those come off and we think right now we have a competitive rate that will keep us managing and maintaining those balances but well see how that plays out over the next days brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you operator the next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon a indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc sticking with the line of questioning on deposits nice reversal and trends within dda is that sustainable going forward do you think that weve kind of troughed within excess liquidity exiting the balance sheet or is there still some risk maybe in the back end of the year that there is some more migration in that line christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we definitely see it as ratedependent and so what weve said previously and we still believe to be the case is as long as rates remain elevated there will be incremental push for deposit migration that did somewhat slow here in the second quarter and there was a little pop at the end of the quarter but the trend would be still somewhat negative migration until the rate cuts start and at that point as expectations dip lower we think the incremental bid away from money market funds and from other offerings will be less enticing and result in less migration and even possibly stabilization and then subsequent reversal and we think thats our modeling view but we also see anecdotally that other banks have reported similar stabilization and we think thats consistent with industry trend east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and then maybe following up on ebrahims question just looking at some of the uncertainties with the election im just wondering if your greater china clientele are maybe pulling forward some of the activity and anticipation of some of the uncertainty maybe in the back end of the year i guess what is the temperature gauge of your greater china client base and how are they thinking about the election risk or lack thereof in the back end of the year dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well if you look at our greater china customers i think that i dont think they have a much big anticipation of whats going to come out from the election one way or the other and i mean as we looked at interesting enough for the last eight years under two different administrations and if you look at the tariff started in but then in the current administration not only just keep going on in fact add a little bit more but then if you take a look at east west bank we havent really stopped growing our crossborder business and we consistently outperform our peer groups in terms of financial performance i think it all get down to at the end of the day despite political rhetorics and there are some us china geopolitical issue when it get down to national security et cetera the common goods that have been shipped between us and china import and export really hasnt slowed down that much there are a lot of business still a commerce going back and forth and i would say that the vast majority of the business are really business going as usual they dont like to hear those rhetorics however the business is still going as usual what we found is that many of our customers whether they are an import business export business from the greater china region or us to the asia region and they continue to do business they continue to find ways to do business and we at east west continue to navigate in this rough sea and somehow understanding the dynamic and i think weve done a pretty good job in managing this overall us geopolitical situation and thats why we uniquely find a way to continue to be one of the highest performing bank in a country simply because we know what were doing and we continue to go through ph eight years for many others well look at significant turmoil but for us somehow we get by just fine and this is something that we feel very confident in the next four to eight years i dont know whos going to be the president it really doesnt matter to us because were here to run east west bank we know how to run our business and so far so good timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks indiscernible dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator the next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 hey thank you first one for me is just around capital given that youre not looking to accrete more capital at this stage should we just assume you reup the buyback when youre done or are you more price sensitive at this level and then if not any other ways to return capital that you might be considering christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc ill begin with weve always been both opportunistic and shareholder friendly and those guiding principles will remain during the quarter i think we were fairly opportunistic in the repurchases we did we didnt fully utilize what we have left we have million yet to go and well continue to look at it on an opportunistic basis we would not expect to reauthorize until weve exhausted our current program and so well update you as that comes together matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay but youre not considering any other types of capital return at this stage other than organic growth christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we traditionally look at our dividend on an annual basis and well obviously look at that as we look to our expectations for i think obviously our first and foremost use of capital is to support our customers that will always be our first use capital we are not currently contemplating any meaningful ma activity and we certainly think about the other uses of capital in a shareholder friendly manner matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then for the question just on the loan side i think you hired the head of entertainment lending from city national in the last two to three months have they contributed christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc indiscernible matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co to that in the first quarter okay have they contributed to that entertainment growth yet and how large of a contributor would you like that vertical to be or whats your limit in that vertical christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yes they have already contributed and yes one of the key drivers of growth in our ci business for this quarter was an uptick in entertainment lending and i think we like all of our verticals but we particularly like the entertainment vertical being based here in the los angeles region dominic anything youd care to add east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc im sorry christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc anything youd care to add dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc oh well i think that as much as we always like to have this industry vertical to continue to excel but we at east west bank has very much put overall risk oversight as a priority thats why if you reflect back in march we didnt have the kind of problems like some of the other larger banks had in california because we did not overload ourselves with private equity or venture capital not that we didnt like the business we love those business were doing good with those business but well never allow us to overextend to one particular industry that potentially when there is a run or here and there that causes harm so i very much expect the entertainment business to continue to grow not only in the united states but also in the greater china region we expect the entertainment business to go in a very healthy pace with the exception that well never allow it to grow so much that becomes overconcentrated that potentially causes regret someday when there is so much concentration in one particular industry so east west always run a diversified portfolio as you can see actually quarterbyquarter we always have different winners when chris talked about this quarter is entertainment and something else next quarter probably be somebody else again its nice to see those different units all competing positively to get that championship for a quarter and then by doing that we dont have an issue of overconcentration matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great thank you dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thanks operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh thanks i noticed several times on the call you talked about the optimism for the fee income outlook is there a scenario where there could be a tuckin acquisition and use of capital to grow that business christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 there could be and obviously last year chris youll recall the company made a significant investment in indiscernible the asset management entity that we took the stake in and so those types of opportunities may present themselves but its not top of the agenda as we sit here today looking forward christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and chris while i have you i just want to get a little bit of a better understanding on slide where you talk about the billion of cash flow hedges that come off in the first quarter indiscernible and then the hedges in the back half how should we think about just the impact on margin and nii from those actions in next year christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so the current cash flow hedges are costing us this looks at top of that page the impact is about million a quarter and its pulling down the nim by about basis points in the current period and those hedges largely expire come q1 and so essentially that negative drag will work its way down of course if theres a rate cut in september and additional ones in q4 itll incrementally chip away at that but that whole amount will come off q1 and what will happen then is somewhere in the second half of the year billion of new hedges will come on with a blended average receive of billion to the extent by the middle of the feds down to billion no harm no foul if its above there itll cost us a little for the interim if its below there well see the benefit of that in our bottom line be it in the second half of christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thank you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah operator the next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon just wanted to ask on the loan side on the ci side in particular christopher your mention of the surge late quarter i dont think i heard you comment on this but wonder if theres any throughline in terms of types of loans business purpose or commentary from borrowers that you think kind of drove that surge christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc there was a little bit more activity late in the day from some private equity and one particular biotechrelated entity and i think we were a little bit surprised by the volatility but it was positive so we took it and i think weve seen some of that activity move back already which were not exactly where we expected but a bit of volatility but nonetheless we expect to grow balances in total throughout the third quarter and the fourth quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay great and then if you could update us on the thoughts around the fhlb borrowings you have that replaced the btfp is that purely going to be a function of liquidity trends over time in terms of paying that down or is there a more specific focus on on that christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah i think were focused on making sure we get past sort of this rollover period here with the cds in q3 and if we continue to see positive trends which we have seen and continue to see so far into the q3 period additional oncoming onboarded customers on the deposit side well consider where we put those incremental dollars to work whether thats to just earn cash at the fed or pay down liabilities thats about a push so well look at that and put the money to work obviously every day gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc that having been said i would expect that well keep a good portion of the fhlb outstanding for an extended period of time as we think thats going to become a a component of what otherwise maintains a very strong liquidity profile operator the next question comes from samuel varga with ubs please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon i just want to go back to the deposit conversation for a little bit could you provide an update on private banking deposits and specifically i guess how theyve trended over the past months and then what sort of growth you anticipate over the next to months christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah our private banking customers participated in our cd specials and found that a positive place to put incremental balances to work and so those balances have generally grown we expect them to likely continue to grow as wealth management solutions overall have grown nicely and as they come in they allocate a portion of their portfolio or they reallocate record equity levels into fixed income and stable products and that has generally been a win for us dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think private banking continues to bring in new customers and they are new customers both from the fee incomes perspective in terms of wealth management product side and also on the deposits and loans east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that and just piggybacking off of that on the wealth management side can you just share sort of broader thoughts around this business where do you see it going and the wealth management over the next couple of years what sort of opportunities are there in the market from disruption that youd like to take advantage of christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think on the wealth management area we see a tremendous potential for east west bank our approach is not to trying to do a quick hit but rather take our time to strategically plan it in the right way and then have gradual sustainable recurring and profitable type of business so far has been going good i mean oftentime people may look at our overall wealth management fee income its really not at a very high level from a percentage standpoint to our overall profitability but were trying to grow it in the right way and we see a tremendous opportunity and potential for the demographic of the customers that we have so far and we just see that there is just going to be great opportunity not only just here in the united states and even potentially in asia area samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator the next question comes from andrew terrell with stephens please go ahead andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc most of mine were addressed already but just a quick modeling question chris can you remind us the repricing dynamics on the securities portfolio just how much of that is floating rate at this point and then what does the quarterly cash flow look like christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure so its roughly on the overall mix fixed floating the floating is our ginnie mae floaters at sofr ill call it ph million for conversation and the cash flow on a recurring monthly basis is million to million obviously with some variability andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 got it okay and then do you have offhand just the yield on the securities purchased during the second quarter just trying to think about where the securities yield happened in the christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah there was about million of fixed that call it 55ish and there was the balance with all floaters at sofr ph millionish andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc perfect thank you for taking the questions christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah operator next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask on the spreads that youre getting on your new loans some of your peers have highlighted that there is tougher competition from both banks and nonbanks and thats putting pressure on ci spreads is that something youre seeing in your portfolio as well christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah i think were seeing in ci generally in the sofr million zone for most of the stuff that were putting on balance sheet i dont know that thats atypical for the traditional business ph lines that weve done but thats where were seeing it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then on the commercial real estate front can you talk about what your conversations have been like with borrowers do you think two or three rate cuts from here will alleviate some of the pressure that they are feeling especially on the office and multifamily side and more recently as youve maybe extended or whichever loans have come up for extension what has been the reaction from the borrowers that that brought in more equity just looking to get some more color there thanks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so as dominic said a few minutes ago i dont know that a rate cut or two will make that much difference in the near term and so if rates are elevated in the 5plus zip code for an extended period of time on the base rate its likely there will be pain to be felt by a number of borrowers many of whom buy into projects at cap rates of a few years ago so thatll be a challenge for many of them we have taken a very hard look with irene and dominic but also obviously our credit teams and our atms et cetera all the way down to figure out whats coming due whats the situation where are the cash flows where is the debt service coverage what else can we do with these customers that are up for renewal from now through the end of has been the primary focus but looking at things even beyond that just to make sure that were on top of things so i think the short answer is were doing all of the above to make sure that were proactive and ahead of it it is an issue but to the extent that rates come down not one or two cuts but basis points basis points things get easier and obviously if rates come down basis points well probably theres a lot of issues that just go away manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc ill just add to indiscernible the macro environment for office it is what it is but this continuous review of the portfolio this is something we started before the pandemic and afterwards that we did there for our borrowers to kind of shore up pay down loans pledge additional asset what have you and today i think if you look at the results that we have the still very very good credit quality across the board a lot of that is the proactive actions we took years ago manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and what matters more is it the belly of the curve is it the short end of the curve for that christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc can you reframe the question indiscernible manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh just in terms of indiscernible christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc indiscernible yeah sort of the vast majority of our customers are floating rate borrowers and while they might fix their need to refinance if they can will be best met on the short end east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you
