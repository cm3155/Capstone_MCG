million philanthropic donation that we did early in the cycle ill tell you that our teammates are working really really hard theyre working in many cases theyre working very very closely together its incredible to see the kind of positive results that were getting particularly like in the ppp program where our people were able to stand up literally overnight an automated portal to allow our clients to access automatically with us in terms of getting their applications in our teammates are bonding faster than we would ever have expected and i can say to you today that our culture at truist is really really strong if youre following on the presentation im on slide just as a reminder after the combination we are the sixth largest us commercial bank by assets and market value we have a very strong number weighted average deposit market share in the top msas we have million households teammates we are very well positioned we think to achieve our purpose we are recognized as one of the highestrated financial institutions and were continuing to grow loans and deposits particularly in this period of flight to quality daryls going to cover a lot of information about our very strong capital and liquidity in just a bit but i would point out that our diversification is a real strength we are very diversified in products services and geographies on slide we talk about some of the things were doing with regard to the crisis like others we have been providing payment relief assistance including forbearance deferrals extensions other ways we can help our clients weve already done over accommodations for consumers for our commercial clients weve temporarily waived atm surcharges and were uniquely offering a cash back on qualifying card purchases for important basic needs were real pleased that weve been able to continue to allow indiscernible interventions with our clients in terms of particular needs they have were fortunate that of our branches have drivethroughs so weve been able to keep those branches open in terms of activity weve been really focused on the paycheck protection program our average loan amount is about weve been authorized for companies representing about million employees and were expecting funding to be a little more than billion on the first round and it will likely be more on the second round if it is in fact approved were providing financial relief programs for our small businesses and many other ways also and weve been able to fund without hesitation extensive line draws for our commercial clients for our teammates weve awarded coronavirus relief bonuses to about of our teammates making less than a year weve been very aggressive in providing work from home and other alternative work strategies for our teammates to provide safety for them we also increased our onsite special rate pay for those that have to be at work with critical roles at special pay for those on hourly and a day for those that are not our truist foundation is contributing for every that our truist teammates donate our one team fund which helps our teammates that are in financial hardship and need assistance for our communities we announced earlier million philanthropic contributions this is really going a long way to help we donated million to each of the cdc foundation and johns hopkins and our truist foundation donated million to local united way organizations on page just a few financial highlights we did have billion in our taxableequivalent revenue our adjusted net income available to common shareholders was billion diluted earnings per share on an truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 adjusted basis was our return on tangible common equity adjusted was which is very strong in this environment and our adjusted efficiency ratio was so we feel really good about that our january and february were like a lot of people really strong and then we of course ran into all the challenges that were all experiencing because of covid19 interestingly insurance and mortgage continued to have strong performance throughout the entire quarter our asset quality as clarke will describe to you is actually very good right now but we know thats the calm before the storm and thats why we added a strong million of provision in anticipation of the challenges that we know we will face we have a tight focus on our teammates and our clients and our communities which we believe is our job number one right now if youll go to slide just a couple of the unusual items this quarter we know its a little messy but weve got the issue of the merger and the covid impact our mergerrelated charges are million before tax about negative impact after tax the incremental operating expenses these are the ones that provide future benefits but theyre not a part of the ongoing run rate so we call them out separately and thats million or a share and then the covid impact in terms of cost and foregoing revenues is about million or so there really is in my view about of unusual items which gets you to the if you go to deck slide in loans and leases its been an interesting period you can see that our first quarter average loans was billion but by the end of the period it was billion obviously we had a surge at the end of march we had about billion in drawdowns that continued into early part of april we had another about billion and then it kind of subsided and its been relatively flat since then we do expect substantial ppp funding that said we have in process about billion in committed loans we expect will be drawn down relatively soon in terms of the market i know everybody wants to know whats going to happen i do too but the truth is we just dont know it depends obviously on the depth and the length of the health crisis as we work through that and then how that has the knockoff effect with regard to the economy the good news is going into this the economy was very strong the bad news is small businesses will really struggle to recover from this still i would say to you americans are resilient and i believe our country is likely to outperform in the worst expectations if you look at deposits on page the same kind of thing our average balances were billion it popped up to billion as we had an increase of billion during that period of time about billion of that was line draws but then we also had some seasonal increases and some flight to quality deposits that moved in which we were very pleased to see our total average cost of deposits decreased by basis points which were very happy to see so let me turn it to daryl now and let him give you some detail daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you kelly and good morning everyone today i want to talk about the key points from the first quarter and provide some color on current business conditions turning to slide net interest margin was up basis points purchase accounting contributed basis points to reported net interest margin core net interest margin was down basis points the decline reflected the full quarter impact of the merger of equals lower interest rates and our liquidity bill in march truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 the yield on loans and leases held for investment increased basis points as the benefit from purchase accounting more than offset lower shortterm rates the yield on our portfolio securities portfolio decreased basis points we became more assetsensitive due to floating rate loan growth expected higher prepayments terming out federal home loan bank advances and increased noninterestbearing deposits our loan mix was floating and fixed current trends suggest that net interest margin will decline further from a full quarter impact of lower rates line draws ppp funding and elevated reserves at the fed to protect loan yields we are implementing floors on allnew production and we continue to aggressively reduce deposit costs turning to slide noninterest income increased million reflecting a full quarter from the merger of equals insurance income increased million or versus first quarter due to higher pc commissions organic growth strong retention and increased pricing residential mortgage income was strong with origination volumes at billion refi was of origination and gain on sale margins were basis points while forbearance is a potential headwind that could be offset by higher volume and spreads this quarter several fee income categories were impacted by the pandemic investment banking and trading was impacted by million due to the increase in cva reserves arising from lower interest rates and wider credit spreads as shown on the slide discretionary actions resulted in lower service charges on deposits and card and payment related fees current trends include the seasonally strong insurance income strong residential mortgage production partially offset by lower service income due to forbearance lower asset valuations and lower purchase flowin related to covid19 turning to slide noninterest expense increased million reflecting a full quarter impact from the merger mergerrelated cost included million of mergerrelated and restructuring charges and million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger discretionary actions in response to covid19 impacted noninterest expense by approximately million and included a bonus to all teammates earning less than personnel expense included million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger this was positively impacted by the decrease in the market value of nonqualified plan assets which is offset in net interest income and other income we also updated our intangible valuation as a result annualized full year amortization expense for was revised to about million current trends in expenses include relief measures such as special pay for some clientfacing teammates and measures to better protect our teammates clients and communities we continue to have good core expense discipline even in the face of covid health crisis turning to slide asset quality remains strong but economic conditions have deteriorated truist will continue to apply the cecl standard adopted january our npa ratio increased basis points to basis points largely due to the adoption of cecl and the transition from pci to pcd npls were basis points of total loans up basis points from year end primarily due to the pci to pcd transition adjusting for this transition our npa and npl ratios were essentially flat from last quarter net chargeoffs were basis points of average loans down basis points our provision was million and reflected the reserving in accordance with cecl the increased provision was mostly due to a significant loan growth and scenarios reflecting a weaker economic outlook the increase also reflected a full quarter of post merger activity truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 our allowance coverage ratio was the combination of our allowance and the unamortized fair value mark remains a very robust of total loans the adoption of cecl resulted in strong coverage ratios at times for net chargeoffs and times for npls we expect second quarter asset quality matrix to be elevated reflecting covid stress across the loan portfolio turning to slide the table on the left summarizes our exposure to industries we believe are most vulnerable in the current environment we have very low exposure reflecting meaningful diversification from our merger outstanding loans to the group totaled billion or of loans held for investment at the end of march our oil and gas portfolio is weighted towards lower risk sectors outstanding balances on levered loans totaled billion or billion sic of loans held for investment of our leveraged loans are investment grade or the equivalent we are actively managing these portfolios and will continue to make underwriting or risk acceptance adjustments as appropriate turning to slide the million increase in the acl from the initial cecl adoption reflects rapidlyevolving market conditions our standard practice is to use three scenarios to inform the cecl allowance implying judgment to assign the probability of each scenario these scenarios include moodys baseline with implied rates one optimistic scenario and one stressed scenario we also consider heightened industry concerns from the pandemic effects together with the impact of government relief packages when calculating the cecl estimate slide adds additional details on our loss estimation approach turning to slide our capital ratios declined slightly mostly due to significant balance sheet growth related to line draws however our capital levels remain strong relative to regulatory levels for wellcapitalized banks our cet1 ratio was down in the fourth quarter our dividend and total payout were for the first quarter we are taking a prudent approach to capital due to the uncertainty of the economy our ccar submission incorporated this impact ending cet1 ratios for the internal baseline and severely adverse scenarios well exceeded regulatory minimums and internal poststress policy goals we intend to utilize the fiveyear cecl transition for regulatory capital purposes which provides a basis point benefit to cet1 we expect to grow capital and serve our clients throughout this challenging time turning to slide this slide shows the secondbest performance among peers under stressed conditions and from a capital resiliency perspective due to strong ppnr and lower credit losses a table compares credit loss reserves reported by truist and its peers at march to their respective stress losses under dfast we use stress losses from as this was the last year the fed published dfast results for bbt and suntrust we think that would be similar given the improved risk profile and earnings power of the combined company as the column on the right shows truists ratio of credit loss reserves to stress losses is above the peer average of however after layeringin the unamortized fair value marks on the suntrust portfolio which totaled billion on march truists stress loss coverage increased to this is a great illustration of how the merger enhanced the risk profile of both companies and resulted in a defensive balance sheet that is insulated by purchase accounting marks and cecl reserves it is also another example of why we believe we are better together at truist turning to slide we acted quickly in response to the pandemic to term out shortterm borrowings and increased cash to meet capital funding needs as such our liquidity ratios remained strong with an average lcr of and a liquid asset buffer of our access to secure funding sources remains robust we have truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 experienced a flight to quality amid recent market volatility with total deposits increasing billion and we continue to see robust growth this quarter we have sufficient liquidity to fund our ppp loans from our existing fed balances at the fed in addition holding company cash is sufficient to cover months of contractual expected outflows with no inflows we are withdrawing our guidance for given the uncertainty going forward for the second quarter were providing guidance on several categories based on linked quarter changes versus the first quarter of we expect earning assets to grow in excess of on linked quarter average basis reflecting the increase in loans from ci line draws and the ppp program total taxable equivalent revenue will be down a few percent linked quarter reflecting a meaningful decline in net interest margin driven by lower rates liquidity build and fee income pressure as noted earlier core noninterest expense adjusted for the merger amortization and covid expenses is expected to be flat linked quarter excluding the adjustment for the nonqualified plan were making good progress generating savings from third party spend and facilities optimization depending on the length of the economic downturn how deep the downturn goes and how effective the government programs play out will influence scenarios that unfold you can see net chargeoffs increased throughout the year and possibly add more pressure to build the allowance we are also striving to achieve positive operating leverage despite this challenging environment now let me turn it back to kelly for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and qa kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks darryl so in terms of the accomplishments and keep in mind we really just merged these two companies in december so weve accomplished a lot most importantly we rolled out the truist culture we were able to complete town hall meetings we had a few at the very end that we had to cancel or defer because of covid19 but we got through most of the enterprise and the reception to it was extremely good we introduced and rolled out our truist visual identity and logo we did complete the purchase of truist center which is our corporate headquarters here in charlotte we launched the truist foundation and we were able to go ahead and begin consolidating some redundant real estate portfolio that we had that we could go ahead and begin to get some early cost saves so in terms of the next steps if you think about it right now we really have two major priorities number one priority is focusing on covid19 were laserfocused on taking care of our teammates making sure everybodys safe and well were doing everything we can possibly do to support our clients not only in terms of their safety in terms of interaction with us but also in terms of helping them sustain the economic challenges that are going along with this terrible experience were all going through were trying to be very willing to invest and be creative in terms of how to support our communities and were doing some really interesting things there in terms of broadband and those types of things that we could do to help communities that are really really struggling so the second priority for us is keeping the integration and conversion on track we believe we are in a good place there its hard to know exactly what may happen with regard to any delays it really depends on the depth and the lift of the health crisis but at this point we still feel good about where we are in terms of our planned conversion and integration activities in terms of our performance targets we still believe in the mediumterm we would project a return on tangible common equity in the low adjusted efficiency in the low you can see were already pretty much there and we still remain very confident in terms of our billion in net cost saves exactly when we achieve that kind of depends on obviously the environment were living in if its a v then well recover pretty quickly and well hit these in a nottoodistant medium targettype of range if its a u itll take a little truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 bit longer and thats just pretty obvious regardless we believe that we will be a toptier performer whatever the absolute numbers are i will say to you that all of the benefits of the merger look better now than they did a year ago finally if you look at our value proposition slide we believe we provide a really strong value proposition we are a purposedriven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities thats really important more important than ever in todays world we have an exceptional franchise with diverse product services and markets we have strong market share in vibrant fastgrowing msas in the southeast midatlantic and a growing national presence we have a very comprehensive and diverse business mix in banking capital markets and insurance and very importantly we are simply better together were stronger were more resilient we have bestinbreed in terms of talent technology strategy and processes we are very uniquely positioned to deliver bestinclass efficiency and returns while investing in the future that said we have net billion of net cost saves yet to come these complimentary businesses are clearly going to yield substantial revenue increases as we develop the synergies our returns and capital are buoyed by purchase accounting accretion which daryl has described to you and were making meaningful investments in technology capabilities our teammates marketing and advertising we have a very strong capital and liquidity with resilient risk profile enhanced by the merger we are very prudent and disciplined in risk management and financial management we have a very conservative risk culture leading credit metrics among the highestrated large banks we have diversification benefits that arise from the merger weve discussed we stress test very very well separately and together we have a very strong capital and liquidity position being enhanced even with the flight to quality and we have a very defensive and i would call a strong and resilient balance sheet supported by purchase accounting marks combined with the cecl credit reserves because of the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity i would expect us to continue our dividend as we move forward into as far as we can see so like i said in january if you liked us a year ago you should love us now and we continue to believe our best days are ahead ryan ill turn it back over to you ryan richards directorinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you kelly john at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions we will take our first question from saul martinez of ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning guys wanted to ask a little bit about the outlook for credit and the airplay with the accounting and a lot of the moving parts there so on slide you go through your day one january trueup and the additional reserve builds in the first quarter but darryl how much of can you just tell us how much of the billion credit mark is billion loan mark sorry is for credit versus liquidity and rates daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah saul so first i would tell you when we came up with our day one estimate on our reserve we had three scenarios that we came up with and we weighted our stress there on day one so we started the year off with a strong reserve from that perspective when we moved over and made our provision this quarter we went through multiple scenarios as we always run and then with moodys changing their scenarios every few days we actually ended up running different scenarios through quarter end into early april trying to help use an overlay to help us adjust on that cecl number that we came up with and then at the end of the day youre back to using expert judgment we always have qualitative factors this year or this time clarke and ellen and the team really had to spend a lot of time qualitatively because the models have limitations when the government is infusing over trillion and they have to weigh in on what the effectiveness is you have all these payment plans basically out there and you need the expert judgment on how effective those programs might be so theres lots of qualitative adjustments that we came up with we feel very good about the reserves that we have there as far as your fair value mark we basically its a combination of credit liquidity and interest rate and its at billion saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay how much of that is credit versus interest rate daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp we didnt disclose that out saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay so going forward truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i mean at the end of the day saul at the end of the day i mean its all going to accrete into earnings its all going to be used as a lower value for when we you get a little bit of benefit because you have a lower book value saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yes daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp when you apply your reserve so its all going to count whether its credit interest rate or liquidity it really doesnt matter saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it but im trying to understand the loss absorbing capacity for credit a little bit more and then just going forward though i mean you did mention that there is a possibility for reserve builds and if i think about going forward if the economic environment does worsen and credit does worsen more than whats sort of embedded in your outlook how does that play out obviously on the suntrust book youll have to and on your bbt legacy book youll have to trueup your acls but on the credit mark do you if it turns out that whatever that portion of the billion thats for credit marks is insufficient and the losses will be larger than that how does that work in terms of the accounting do you need to reestimate that down and then get a subsequent benefit on purchase accounting accretion i guess what im asking is even going forward do you get a is there a risk of sort of a double hit to your equity base from reserve builds and credit mark adjustments that only come back over time daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so when you come up with your cecl reserves you really dont take into account the fair value mark it is a lower book value so you end up providing less it really is going to depend on what i said in my prepared remarks what happens in the economy is it going to be more stressful is the government plans how effective theyre going to be and then how deep it really is clarke clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp saul we assumed through a weighted probability of all those scenarios that daryl described and we did our estimate we assumed very sharp initial gdp contraction a spike in unemployment and then lingering high single digit unemployment for the twoyear reasonable supportable period and our mean reversion was basically similar to what we experienced after the great recession and so then we did to daryls point a good bit of sensitivity analysis around the different stress portfolios we looked at the historical and projected redefault rates on the different margin deferrals and we baked all of that into our qualitative overlay so we feel like the estimate today is the best we know obviously if things deteriorate worse we would have to provide more if they if it holds up as weve projected then were wellreserved truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc i mean i understand it on the cecl reserve but on the unamortized loan mark if the losses are greater than billion will you recalibrate those estimates how does that work daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so you have a year to trueup your goodwill but thats based upon a miscalculation you had at the but we feel pretty good we finalized all the marks i think i mentioned that the new amortization amount is on the intangible so all that was truedup this quarter actually we have a table on it in the deck so all thats kind of finalized from that perspective we really cant go back and readjust any of that saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay so theres no theres not really a risk there that theres an incremental loss associated with that on top of this disclosure i guess daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thats correct yeah thats right saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you all right thanks a lot operator we will now take our next question from gerard cassidy of rbc please go ahead your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning daryl and good morning kelly kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc daryl can you share with us it looks like your purchase accounting accretion came in stronger this quarter your tangible book value obviously jumped up to a share that is probably attributed to i guess stronger purchase accounting accretion can you give us some color on how that worked out this quarter versus maybe prior expectations daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 yeah so we came in higher than expected and it was mainly due to loans paying off both on the corporate side and on the consumer side so it was a little bit above our own estimate that we had on a goforward basis i would say that you cant count on that basically overestimating throughout the year its possible but you wouldnt count on it so if you look at core versus reported margin we were basis points difference i would probably think it averages closer to basis points on a consistent basis but you never know whats going to happen on a quartertoquarter basis on payoffs its just some people will pay off their loans you have to basically take in all the accretion gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and then on slide which was very insightful and appreciate you putting that together can you share with us and maybe its as simple as the economic assumptions are not are different than the stress test but why its in cecl accounting its anyone you and your peers are looking at lifeofloan losses why arent the reserves even higher and where is it the highest relative to the stress losses why dont they match with the stress tests were testing for again is it as simple as the economic assumptions daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so theres a difference between cecl and stress testing stress testing is a dynamic living breathing process so you basically have to project new volumes and growth or oneoffs depending on whatever happens cecl is basically a static balance sheet with oneoff assumptions so theres differences there the chart that weve put in on just to give credit we basically plagiarized that from jason goldberg i give jason a lot of credit for that but i think on that table it clearly shows that our reserves that we have versus the combined company losses that weve added together from is at so its a little bit above the peer group and then if you add in the fair market value its at one thing to note though if you actually look at our companyrun results on a combined basis in that number was basically the reason im telling you that is that we dont have our ccar stress results yet from the fed that will come later this quarter but we do have what we submitted to the fed a few weeks ago and if you look at what the companyrun stress results were on severely adverse we were basically at so i think that shows a good indication that as we put the companies together clarke and ellen have really de risked the company and we just are a lessriskier company than we wouldve been on a combined basis so our reserves then at and then if you add in the fair value mark youre at of our we came up with billion of losses in our severely adverse gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very helpful thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you operator well now take our next question from betsy graseck of morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for the call and the color two questions one you gave us the number of customers that have been requesting deferrals i think its on the consumer side and on the wholesale side can you give us a sense as to the percentage of balances that those each represent clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah betsy this is clarke on the consumer side its about billion thats for both owed to us and serviced for others so its about billion for balance sheet so roughly on the commercial side its about roughly billion or so or so again i would note the far majority of all of our reagings have been with accounts that are current to start with even in our subprime auto as an example so again i think this is a very unusual environment so you have a lot of people that are worried that have maybe have lost their jobs or maybe have not but theyre worried and but its a little different than normal and that most are current to start with betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and in your forward look on the cecl that were just talking through how high do you expect those numbers to go daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i mean it really depends on the three factors i said earlier betsy i mean right now we feel we are adequately reserved from what we know there is a lot more that we dont know than what we know though and how things are going to impact i mean the government is going to have over trillion of stimulus when its all said and done thats three times more than what they had in the great recession we really dont know how effective those programs are going to be so you really need to let a lot of that play out all the forbearance thats been occurring right now i mean that all has to play out and some of the clients may not make it but it is we feel really comfortable where we are reserved today and well just see what happens as we move forward kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and betsy keep in mind too that the effects of the payroll protection program will keep people whole in terms of their income and those that are furloughed in most cases as i understand it their unemployment insurance because there was an increase in the normalized unemployment insurance substantially in many cases people have more takehome income than they had before so its hard to see exactly today in the short run that there would be a huge negative impact obviously if this is extended and the government programs dont provide continued stimulus then it will be a factor but in the short run the government has actually done a pretty good job in terms of providing shortterm buffer betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 got it yeah okay and then just moving to expenses on the billion i understand its hard to know the timeframe given everything thats going on im just wondering how much of that billion do you feel you can control today versus maybe you put aside because its redundancies that you dont want to touch at this stage kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well its all of it is of a term that is still achievable youre right though some of it may be deferred because of the environment were in today because of more people being working away from the office connectivity et cetera there may be some things that were not able to do as quickly as we had anticipated but our people are setting this daily and as of today they have not discovered any material issues that will dramatically slow down our progression in terms of integration and the progression of that integration is what drives the cost saves daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp and ill give you a couple examples so on the third party vendor right now our teams are still working on it but were probably to of the way of our target so well have about a close to million annual run rate save this year and for the next couple years we have already locked in million of that so thats progressing well were making really good progress on our corporate real estate portfolio we have over square feet right now we have known savings in there of about million of what were executing on if you look at what were going through right now with people working at home we have to really evaluate the impacts of that after its all said and done but that could be an opportunity for much more saves so we have million we might go down to million over the next three to five years i mean you just dont know that so that could be even a bigger opportunity but those are just a few examples betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks operator and well now take our next question from mike mayo of wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi a few more questions about your forward guidance kelly i thought you said or maybe daryl talked about the potential for positive operating results this year which seems pretty tough with your second quarter guidance as it relates to that guidance on the ph site expenses in the second quarter youve mentioned denver real estate all these other things and you said that was ex the covid effect and then the other part of the guidance some other banks have said expect much higher reserves reserve building in the second quarter i know youve given some numbers on that but just exactly where you stand thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah mike so i would definitely say its going to be a challenge from linkedquarter from first to second we will continue to execute and do the best that we can within the parameters that we have and we arent giving up on our positive operating leverage were going to do the best we can we may not achieve it this year but we still truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 may it is not out of the woods it all depends on how quickly the economy recovers and if its a sharp v we have a shot at it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and the other question the reserve build in the second quarter i mean some banks say hey look since the end of the first quarter conditions have gotten worse i guess you use moodys i guess and maybe have some flexibility to use your own capital markets group for forecasts like the larger banks or given the decline since the end of the first quarter will you expect more reserve building even though youve said youre reserved for like your banksubmitted stress test which is a big number thats all in with your purchase accounting marks if i got that correct daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yes youre right on that as far as we use moodys and we also have a couple other scenarios that we run but we went into early april running scenarios and adjusting our reserve but we didnt kind of off on the we closed a little later this quarter just because we were later in the cycle so we went through at least the first week of april with that information clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah and again if the economy actually underperformed those scenarios we would have to provide more but based on what we know today we think were wellreserved but were certainly watching it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so how much of the expense savings have you achieved so far and you said some of the timeframes might split and you mentioned some areas that youll still have but its i mean you have the pandemic with the biggest merger in your history happening at the same time so its a tough situation and it sounds like youre managing through it but maybe just to get out on the table now what we should expect as opposed to wait until later daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so from a specific expense savings we have some savings there has been some slippage just with what happened in march and that with covid some of our expenses are a little bit elevated we pulled forward buying a bunch of our laptops and myfis and other equipment that got pulled forward into the first quarter that we were planning on later in the year so it was a little bit elevated from that perspective our goal was to try to get our expenses down up to out of billion by the end of the year we are on track so far this quarter to doing that we were trying to have some buffer and be ahead of that it doesnt get any easier as we get into this next quarter to be honest with you but we still have a shot at getting our at the end of the year if we have a sharp recovery mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah operator we will take our next question from john pancari of evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi regarding the exposures the atrisk credit exposures on slide the billion i know you indicated on that slide that you have qualitative overlays for the affected industries so can you give us a little bit more color on that on the magnitude and maybe the amount of loan loss reserve against those portfolios and maybe the loan mark against them clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp so we havent disclosed that level of detail i would tell you this that for each of those segments we have done detailed analysis things like risk grade notching and a good bit of sensitivity to the downside in each and every one of those weve looked at modification or deferral request and so we used that to add additional overlays on top of what the models wouldve driven in theyre considerably higher than the other segments i would just tell you that john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right and then the in terms of the insurance business i know you indicated in your second quarter outlook that you or in your outlook that you do expect covid to dampen the organic trends in the business can you give us just a little bit more detail on how that could play out and is there are an offset from perhaps any better pricing that you see in the industry just want to see how you think about how that plays out thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so chris will cover that christopher l henson a headbanking insurance truist financial corp yeah this is chris john thank you for the question first off we would expect second quarter to be up about thats our seasonally strongest quarter of the year and youre right the slowdown as a result of covid really is creating declining exposure units that could be lost people lost business what have you and that will slow truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 economic i mean new business production but to your point there would be a potential pick up on pricing when we went into the great recession we went in with the backdrop of a soft insurance market we go into this one with actually a very strong market on the back of and being the two largest insured losses in history so were kind of in the up range right now which if we got to go into one thats a good backdrop to have at your youre going to have at your back and just for this quarter for example rates were up if you throw on top of that lower interest rates this life i mean these pc underwriters are going to be struggling on their investment returns so they will likely continue to keep upward pressure on the rate environment so i think your intuition is exactly right we reached that momentum in pricing for the balance of the year but we do see softening business production so what we might have been looking at this past quarter we had organic growth kind of looking forward its looking more like maybe in the flat to kind of range for the balance of the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks chris operator we will now take our next question from ken usdin of jefferies please go ahead your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you good morning daryl just wondering if we could step back out a step on the revenue side you talked about second quarter revenues down a few percent and just following on a bit of the fee part that was just talked about can you help us just understand nii versus fees theres so many moving parts involved but if you can directionally just help us understand the moving parts and direction of fees thatd be helpful thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah just high level ken i would tell you and chris commented on insurance insurance is seasonally strong second quarter that wont change from that perspective service charges we have some programs in place to help our clients during this time of stress thats what kelly talked about the cashback we are waiving atm fees so people can meet their banking services people are coming in now were getting more requests for relief on nsf and were granting that so i would say the service charges overall might be down a touch from that perspective depending on what interest rates do and credit spreads those areas while the volumes are overall lower there it hits dda the million that line item has a chance of recovering potentially on what happens with that and then mortgage mortgage will have good volumes strong the offset will be the impact on forbearance on the servicing we did try to factor in some estimates on the msr valuation already we dont know if thats the full impact of that but it is embedded in there so we did adjust for that accordingly so mortgage will probably have a decent quarter would be my guess ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and on the nii side also can you just help us understand the balance sheet looks like its going to keep growing and you mentioned the difference between stated and core nim but can you help us understand just most a lot of other peers are talking about nii growing from here you guys have the purchase accounting as an extra factor in that any way you can help us just parse out the moving parts there too truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i dont foresee our unless purchase accounting really is stronger than we think i dont foresee nii being positive second quarter versus first quarter core margin if you looked at our sensitivities and you probably need to go back to our disclosures back in january when we disclosed what a down basis points now our disclosures that we show on our earnings reports are gradual so its assuming that basis points would go down throughout the months at that point in january it was a negative if you say thats equivalent to like a shock of basis points so what we experienced in march was a shock of basis points now you had a little bit weird going on with libor and libor well talk about in a second but we had a shock of basis points so if you take the and multiply it by that would probably be what the impact would be rough estimate on what our nii change might be for second quarter from that perspective then we have built a lot of liquidity now we built liquidity because were in a stress period we want to make sure we can meet our clients needs both from a funding and from a deposit perspective so the costs that were carrying what were carrying at the fed right now is anywhere from to basis points i mean if you look at our balance sheet right now and through friday on april our balance sheet and total balances are billion our deposits now are billion so all the government stimulus checks that started to come in last week we had one day i think it was wednesday where we went up billion in deposits in that one time period our ppp funding is going to start going on the books it started last week its going to go on this week and the following week well probably have billion of loans so were definitely going to have much higher earning assets the other thing i would note is that our deposit costs we were at basis points down basis points on an interestbearing basis if you look at march our interestbearing deposit costs were already basis points when you go back and look at the great recession and you look at how far the deposit costs get down to back then we got down to about basis points so i dont think were going to get to basis points in the second quarter but were going to get in the for sure over the next couple quarters as we continue to push down rates if these rates stay where they are so i think we got a lot of things that we have to manage with but core margin will be down because of liquidity but once we feel that the stress is over we can reverse the liquidity pressure there pretty easily and you get that core margin back so hopefully thats helpful ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc very much so daryl and you were going to talk about libor and that is a point i was wondering if you could talk about how are you seeing libor normalize down as you look out over time thanks for all the color daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so it peaked on april at basis points its now at basis points onemonth libor we have about billion net libor assets tied to onemonth libor right now so as that migrates down that will kind of put in that full effect to that interest rate sensitivity that you saw there we arent there yet it still has room to come down some more but that will also allow us to push down our deposit costs faster too as libor is coming down as well and when you look at the money market equivalent that will all kind of come down together so it will hurt our asset side but were going to make it up on the deposit side ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks very much truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp youre welcome operator we will now take our next question from matt oconnor of deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so you guys have addressed the risk that some of the integration gets delayed if we dont get a vshaped recovery here i guess on the flipside the risk of losing customers and staff to competitors is probably a lot less than maybe some people fear partly because of virus partly the actions that youre doing for your staff seems very generous so maybe you could just talk kelly bill about the engagement of your staff and how you keep the culture kind of both moving in the same direction you cant do it from the town halls that you were doing before but just talk about some of those kind of softer aspects of doing the business and your customer base or employee base thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah why dont you go ahead and maybe ill add a comment at the end william h rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp okay yeah thanks matt i think as youd point out i mean the pension numbers were already good coming in from a teammate perspective and we just did a survey that was an engagement proxy and in this incredible environment the survey actually showed high levels of engagement from our teammates in many ways the cultural integration has been accelerated by months if not years because people are operating under stressful conditions the teamwork has been spectacular i think kelly you would echo that that no ones wearing a jersey because theyre all headed towards the same objective so i think youve point out accurately there are elements of this that are advantageous as we go through this process and ive personally been just really really proud of the work that our teammates have done the town halls and the rollout of purpose mission and values we were well underway there and that has been a really good catalyst because everybodys got something to lean forward on theyre all speaking the same language and operating from the same playbook truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and i will just point out one additional point i said earlier the culture matters always it really matters in a time like this and a really big part of our culture is just taking care of our teammates and we get that our clients come first but you cant take care of your clients without doing a really good job for your teammates and so truist is unique in terms of having a fully paid for pension plan and of ph truists own safe 401k match and then we do things like bonuses and premium pay for people on the line so all of those things our teammates really appreciate and so they see that during difficult times were going to take care of them even if theres some sacrifice in terms of shortterm profitability were going to take care of our teammates because they can feel safe and secure and then they can help our clients feel safe and secure those memories will be here for decades and so we feel very good about our culture as bill said it is accelerated and it is strong as steel matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful and then just a question for daryl you talked about for new loans implementing some floors could you just talk about the rates how much above the floors that you are and i assume as loans come up for renewal youll attempt to do the same thing on those loans daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so david reported i think a week or two ago that the floors that hes putting in range anywhere from i think to basis points from a libor perspective i think those are the floors that hes putting in from that perspective thats the libor rate not the spread over matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp welcome operator and we will take our next question from erika najarian of bank of america please go ahead your line is open erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning i just had one followup question of this million in annualized cost save that you noted how much of that is achievable without interruption to pandemicrelated support of your employees and your clients and if im interpreting daryl your answer to betsys question million of annual run rate savings from thirdparty vendors million from known savings in corporate real estate so it sounds like at least million of that for million would have nothing to do with supporting your employees or clients truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so erika just one comment and daryl can add youre right you can count i think in terms of expenses being bifurcated there are expenses that are independent of covid like real estate some of our vendor contracts are independent of covid and weve seen substantial reductions in our run rate vendor contracts already and more to come with regard to the teammates theres a onetime big charge we had with regard to the bonus but the ongoing from this point forward teammate charges are not are marginally incremental and in terms of the impact on the conversion it really depends but today our people are functioning very well working offsite and then keep in mind we in the technology area weve already weve got thousands of people working offsite forever so this is not a new idea its just more people doing it and so as long as theyre able to continue to do their scoping and their mapping and their programming remotely which now we see that they can its now selfevident that there will be a dramatic change with regard to our integration and conversion scheduling daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah for the second quarter erika we are paying a premium to our teammates right now that are on the frontlines you see ph that weve got an elevated charge in personnel with that depending on how quickly we basically can adjust from work at home that will fade away we also are actively getting more laptops sent to more people on the call centers can do more of their work at home so that will subside as we get more of that equipment in as well that weve accelerated from that perspective as far as like the implementation of thirdparty and facilities as they execute and play out thats when you get the savings so you may not see as much early on this year but as it goes out throughout the year and as we continue to move it will start to build that said the fourth quarter will have a higher annualized impact than what you would see at this point from that perspective so a lot of good things although some of the thirdparty savings is tied to conversions i mean just to be transparent there is some big card conversions coming up some big conversions coming up in the wealth and brokerdealer areas so i think right now in joes world hes planning to hell stay on track with an earlier conversion and in brokerdealer i think thats going to be in the first part of if that stays on track that might miss a little bit at the end of but he wasnt supposed to be there at the end of hes scheduled more for early but if that plays out then some of those savings will come in at that point in time erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator we will now take our next question from stephen scouten of piper sandler please go ahead your line is open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 hey good morning guys thanks first i want to say thank you guys for the way you all are leading in community impact being in one of your affected communities id say the leadership has appreciated in importance so thank you guys for that i wanted to ask you as it pertains to your capital and how youve talked about longerterm when you get back to to resume buyback and ph i would just assume in this environment probably that far ways out but im just curious how are you thinking about that number the cet1 versus kind of the i think it was if you imposed indiscernible and the cecl impact and kind of how that pertains to that target and where you think about buybacks way down the line kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so nobodys thinking about buybacks today we are in a very strong capital position and are still bringing capital i mean we still made indiscernible even before adjustments this year this quarter so we will be steadily moving up unless there are dramatic increases in loan losses which we would not project at this time again if its a long view that makes a difference we all understand that so we have said that our intermediate term target was weve said we did that because of the uncertainty that we knew about with regard to the merger weve said we were doing that because of uncertainties we didnt know about we didnt know about covid of course but thank goodness we did prepare for that and were in a really good position now as those uncertainties subside in terms of the merger integration and surely the health crisis will go away and surely the economy will improve then we have said and i would reaffirm we have capital opportunities as we go forward below that level it will depend on the then existing circumstances but there are opportunities available for our shareholders daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp and the other minor point is remember that ppp loans were putting on the books have a risk weight so we put billion on from the first round thats not going to cost us any riskweighted capital and then from a leverage number even though were going to fund it ourselves its not going to really cost us because were basically just trading out at basis points balance at the fed to basis point earning asset from ppp so from a capital perspective those should be fine stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thanks helpful and then one other thing im curious weve seen some others in the industry kind of tighten underwriting standards around resi mortgage ph fee loss other categories have you guys i mean youve always been fairly conservative on lending but have you further tightened any of your underwriting standards and kind of within that what are you seeing with the forbearance request in terms of industry concentration thanks again clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp steve this is clarke i would say yes to that question across all our asset classes weve done pretty extensive reviews and we have made underwriting and risk acceptance changes as appropriate as you would expect us to do so i think we would be more on the conservative end and they are in place today truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 weve also worked hard to be very careful about what we call any nonessential lending right now given the uncertainty so as far as the modification requests id say from the commercial side weve had a lot in the stressed industries that weve laid out things like hospitality et cetera and then on the consumer side its been predominantly on the mortgage and the auto side right now kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and youll recall so we have made some adjustments with regard to underwriting standards even precovid clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp thats right kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so we had already been anticipating a potential slowdown weve made adjustments already stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thank you guys very much operator we will take our next question from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning daryl is there an average life on the ppp loans that we should expect daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp sure chris we dont really have a good estimate on how much forgiveness is going to be out there if i gave you a number it would be a pure guess right now so i dont really know whether it goes out my guess is were everybodys making their loans now so you get a big tsunami remember the sba has to process all these forgivenesses in days they probably are going to take some time to process all that so my guess is that might linger on into three four five months before all the forgivenesses are happened and well see how quickly they do that but then there will be some and portions of some loans that will stay the full two years we will accrete the earnings then well book them at a discount the last time i looked at our average discount that looked like on the books its about discount and that will accrete in and then when it pays off for forgiveness well take all that in at that point in time if it plays out to two years then you just earn it over that time period christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 got it that makes sense thanks very much guys for all the information today operator and we will take our final question john mcdonald of autonomous research please go ahead your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey guys two quick followups im wondering if you could give any color on how the reserve is allocated between consumer and commercial buckets as of today clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah john i would just say and one noteworthy thing for the increase for q1 about of that reserve that provision increase was related to commercial and about was consumer indiscernible can see on the split between i guess we can get back to you on that john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp on that split in the actual allowance of sales we can get you that john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then just kind of wondering this comes up with questions frequently is there a dumbed down example you guys could give us of how the marks absorb credit and how that helps is it just the idea that if you have a writeoff on a marked loan youre marking it down from a smaller amount if its loan and youre writing it down from as opposed to so its a smaller chargeoff thats kind of the question like how does that mechanic work of help getting absorb losses the marks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah thats exactly right so that basically your book value is lower so you apply your reserve against a lower balance so it helps you have a little bit but then i think of it as its earnings that are coming in those earnings can be used to provide for other provisions or could fall at the bottom line from an earnings perspective john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research meaning the paa daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i think yeah exactly i think to your first question truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research oh got it daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp you got it clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah john back to the first your first question the wholesale reserves for q1 are about billion and the consumers billion john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and daryl when you think about it the loss absorbancy it comes in the form of paa so youve got an extra cushion thats how you kind of think of it absorbing losses as giving you have more cushion on the paa side daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah well we definitely have more absorption more cushion from that perspective but also i think when you just got the bank coming together and the diversification of how we came together i mean we really dont have any really significant exposure to any of our portfolios because as we came together were much more diversified and that should play out when the new stress tests come out from the fed later this quarter our hope is that were going to have a really strong ppnr a really strong loss number and a very resilient capital ratio we should hopefully be well under the basis point stress capital buffer kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and remember that in all of our portfolios essentially the exposure was reduced in half because of the doubling of the denominator so it is an automatic diversification of this material in this kind of environment john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks guys operator we have no further audio gap ryan richards directorinvestor relations truist financial corp okay okay thanks very much and thank you everyone for joining us today hope everyone has a good day and please stay
