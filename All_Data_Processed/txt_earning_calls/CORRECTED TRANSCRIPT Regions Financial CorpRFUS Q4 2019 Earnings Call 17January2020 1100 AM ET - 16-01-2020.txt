all phases of the economic cycle although market uncertainty continues the economy is still growing our customers are optimistic about their businesses and consumer confidence remains healthy were also encouraged by progress made on the trade front however well continue to monitor geopolitical tensions and the uncertainties they introduce as we begin the new year we have solid momentum and feel good about how were positioned we have a comprehensive hedging strategy in place to protect net interest income so we dont have to stretch for loan growth our core businesses continue to produce good results generating growth in consumer checking accounts and households credit cards and wealth assets under management were very pleased with the performance of our priority markets and investments in our businesses continue to pay off we have a robust credit risk management framework and while asset quality continues to normalize overall it remains pretty benign and finally although weve made significant progress to simplifying growth were only onethird complete with our current list of identified initiatives there are a lot of process improvements and of revenue generating regions

about our plans which support delivering consistent sustainable results through all phases of the economic cycle david david j turner jr chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet adjusted average total loans decreased less than while ending total loans increased modestly adjusted average consumer loans increased led by increases in indirectother credit card and mortgage partially offset by declines in home equity average business loans decreased and were impacted by our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability as well as lower line utilization and elevated pay down activity during the quarter we continue to focus on riskadjusted returns and are not interested in pursuing nominal loan growth for short term benefit that said we expect full year average loan balances to remain relatively stable on a reported basis and to grow in the low singledigits on an adjusted basis similar to we expect loan growth to be led by business services lending specifically ci loans with modest growth in owneroccupied commercial real estate and investor real estate within consumer lending we expect growth in residential mortgage indirectother card and direct lending turning to average deposits reflecting seasonal trends average corporate segment deposits increased average wealth segment deposits increased while average consumer segment deposits remained relatively stable of note total noninterestbearing deposits grew during the quarter deposit growth in the business segments was partially offset by a decline in other segment deposits due primarily to reductions within wholesale corporate treasury deposit categories reflective of a lower need for wholesale borrowings so lets look at how this impacted net interest income and margin net interest income declined linked quarter and net interest margin declined basis points to net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower market interest rates however this was partially offset by declining deposit cost and a more favorable funding mix lower loan balances reduced net interest income but benefited net interest margin with respect to funding we completed the cash tender offer during the quarter for approximately twothirds of our outstanding parent company senior notes incurring million in extinguishment costs the estimated run rate benefit in is an increase to annual net interest income of approximately million and a to 2basis regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 point improvement in margin as expected total deposit cost declined basis points compared to the prior quarter to basis points and interestbearing deposit cost declined basis points to basis points the associated deposit beta was this quarter regions continues to deliver industryleading performance in the space exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise assuming a stable rate environment we expect modest reductions in deposit cost moving forward now that the majority of our forwardstarting hedges have begun our balance sheet is largely insulated from movement in shortterm rates and additional hedging and securities repositioning have reduced roughly half of our sensitivity to longerterm rates billion of forwardstarting hedges were added during the quarter aimed at locking in a portion of fixed rate originations looking ahead during the first quarter we expect the margins to expand in the low3 as the benefits of our hedging strategy begin now lets take a look at fee revenue and expenses adjusted noninterest income increased compared to the third quarter led by growth in capital markets wealth management and service charges capital markets experienced a record quarter driven by growth across most categories notably ma advisory loan syndications and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers commercial swap income also benefited from favorable cva adjustments during the quarter although mortgage income decreased compared to the prior quarter results remained strong despite seasonally lower production as well as less favorable hedging and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights for the full year mortgage was a significant contributor to noninterest income growth increasing other noninterest income declined this quarter driven primarily by positive valuation adjustments to certain equity investments in the prior quarter that did not repeat at the same level lets move on to the noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses remain wellcontrolled increasing slightly compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits marketing and professional fees salaries and benefits increased modestly driven by higher productionbased incentives the increase in marketing expense was driven primarily by additional campaigns targeting priority markets while professional fees reflected the timing of legal and consulting cost the companys fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was and the effective tax rate was as john mentioned we continue to benefit from our continuous improvement process as we were only onethird complete with our current list of identified initiatives several of which are exceeding our initial expectations for example at investor day we committed to reducing our total square footage by million square feet and our thirdparty spend by million to million by we also disclosed plans to consolidate branches during that same period based on the progress we made in were on track to exceed our targets related to square footage and third party spend reductions as well as branch consolidations were now targeting thirdparty spend reductions in the million to million range and we will continue to look for opportunities to pull forward or expand on initiatives where we can for we recognize revenue growth will be challenging however we remain committed to achieving full year adjusted positive operating leverage while our hedging strategy helps mitigate the risk from lower rates full year growth and net interest income will be difficult we have good momentum and growing noninterest revenue which we expect to continue so while total revenue growth may be modest we will continue to lean into expenses and the opportunities identified through simplifying growth all the while continuing to make prudent investments to drive revenue growth regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 we will again spend approximately million on technology in we expect to open approximately new branches and we will continue to hire talented bankers across our businesses with respect to the effective tax rate we expect the full year range to be to so lets shift to asset quality overall credit results remained in line with our risk expectations during the quarter we saw improvement in several categories while experiencing some normalization than others net chargeoffs were basis points for the quarter and basis points for the year in line with our expected range of to basis points for provision equaled net chargeoffs resulting in an allowance equal to of total loans and of total non accrual loans nonperforming loans increased primarily attributable to a single credit within the waste management industry which we expect will be resolved over the next several quarters delinquencies and troubled debt restructured loans remained stable quarteroverquarter while business services criticized loans decreased for we expect full year net chargeoffs between and basis points let me comment briefly on cecl we continue to finalize our day one impact assumptions and expect the impact to be in the million to million range so lets take a look at capital and liquidity during the quarter the company repurchased million shares of common stock for million and declared million in common dividends our common equity tier ratio was estimated at in line with our target level of the loan deposit ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was the next slide reflects performance against our targets and weve also provided you with a summary of full year expectations wrapping things up in light of the challenging and changing economic backdrop we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial results we have a solid strategic plan designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle with that were happy to take your questions but do ask that each caller ask only one question to allow for more callers we will open the line for your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question comes from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc so we hear you loud and clear and i think your investors appreciate your continued discipline in loan underwriting i think you alluded to in previous calls potential wholesale consumer strategies to offset some of the greensky runoff and i know you listed the categories david during your prepared remarks but maybe dive a little bit into detail about some of the consumer strategy and could there be a potential wholesale strategy and again im not asking if youre buying a depository in terms of obtaining portfolios or accelerating partnerships to deploy your loantodeposit ratio of david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah erika good morning so as we mentioned in the prepared comments the growth will we should experience actually will be more on the business services side on the consumer side were going to continue to have our runoff of our indirect auto portfolio that will put pressure on total balances we have made some shift in terms of our indirectother consumer you saw that in the fourth quarter thatll continue somewhat in the first part of the year then we kind of get to our concentration limit after first quarter or so so you shouldnt see that continue to grow at the same pace that you saw in the fourth quarter throughout the year we are going to continue to grow residential mortgage but we are going to continue to grow our credit card books as well those will be the big drivers of consumer but netnet total consumer will be relatively stable if you carve out the runoff portfolio so the growth that were trying to send the message really is going to come in the primarily in the ci area john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp but erika i would say we are actively observing whats going on in the market looking for opportunities were evaluating different opportunities that may come along clearly we shifted our exposure from the greensky relationship to increasing our exposure through sofi that is largely a result of the fact that sofi is originating loans directly to consumers versus indirectly which was the greensky model we like that better were learning more about sofi and the portfolio that we have and i think you can expect us to continue to explore ways other ways to grow consumer loans over the next year regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it ill go back into queue thank you operator your next question comes from jennifer demba of suntrust john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning you raised your net chargeoff guidance slightly for versus just wondering kind of whats driving that is it more conservatism or are you seeing some underlying weakness in any certain portfolios thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp jennifer this is david so we had to basis points last year we raised it slightly about to basis points acknowledging a couple different things one if you look at last couple of quarters we were at to we also see some normalization of credit especially on the consumer side we also as erika just mentioned some shift in terms of consumer lending into other higher loss categories we feel good about that because were getting paid for the risk that we take but if youre just looking to get the chargeoff number in isolation it will be up perhaps slightly so we didnt think that thats really not signaling any broad deterioration in credit whatsoever jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you operator your next question is from ken usdin of jefferies john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i was wondering if you can follow up the cecl discussion and help us understand how youre starting to think about the day two impacts especially given some of the moving parts of your ins and outs on the consumer portfolio side and youre already high 17ish looks like pro forma reservetoloans ratio do you think youll have to meaningfully build as you go forward and how do you start to help us understand that thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 yeah i think the best way so we need to see what everybody else comes up within cecl clearly the type of lending that you have your portfolio makes a big difference consumer longdated assets duration assets have a much higher cecl reserve to that as you think about cecl for day two the first thing you ought to think about is was a chargeoff expectations and jennifer just brought that up from that then you look at loan growth weve told you was on an absolute basis our loans would be flat on an adjusted basis they would be up a bit so not a lot of change there then you have to think through the mix what are you growing versus whats running off and so well give you better clarity on that at a later date so we dont see a big change in cecl this particular year because we dont currently forecast a change in the economic outlook and thats something that all of us need to be aware of is when you forecast the change in economic outlook they can cause a little bit of volatility in provisioning so those are really the key pieces that i think you should consider as you try to model the provision for next year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right thank you david operator your next question is from peter winter of wedbush securities peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you guys had a good year on the core fee income growth its up about do you think midsingledigit growth is going to be sustainable in and just if you could talk about some of the businesses where you see some of the better growth david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so peter we were very pleased with our growth in the year for noninterest revenue in particular in the fourth quarter if you take our top three categories those are really driven by continued growth in customers so growing customer checking accounts growing operating accounts growing customers from the wealth standpoint those are all critically important to us we feel good about that weve hired additional personnel during that will help us continue to grow customer accounts as you look at mortgage mortgage had a really good year this year itll be hard to repeat that for all of but mortgage will be a big contributor to noninterest revenue and we feel good about where we are there capital markets had a really strong fourth quarter weve mentioned to you before that that business has been about a million to million revenue per quarter business we think that that number is really in the kind of regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 million to million business for us now so we think relative to capital markets should have some nice growth it got off to a pretty slow start in we think its going to get off to a nice in based on the backlog of the business that we see so when you add all that up we have pretty good confidence that were going to have nice growth in noninterest revenue and frankly that is one of the key drivers of why were committed to and believe we will generate positive operating leverage in a challenging rate environment for peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks and just one quick followup you guys have done also a good job on controlling the deposit costs with higher rates and weve seen deposit costs coming down already with the cut in rates im just wondering total deposit costs of basis points is there much room left to lower deposit costs david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp our beta for this past quarter was about thats a little lower than our accumulative beta and our accumulative beta is about this down cycle thats slightly below what we saw in the uprate cycle and as a result of that we think theres if we stay flat here theres no movement which we dont expect much movement from the fed we would continue to have deposit costs come down some more its probably not at the rate that youve seen but i think theres incremental continued benefit there and again thats part of our margin guidance that weve given you too that we think the margin can expand along with the hedging program that we have that margin would expand a bit in peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks david operator your next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt hey matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so look i know theres some kind of drag to loan growth in call it the nearterm here and i think the derisking you guys have been very consistent and have been well received i guess my question is like if we look kind of more mediumterm and think about the type of loan growth that you should have the type of deposit growth that you should have considering the market its like whats reasonable levels again beyond just thinking and the reason im asking is i feel like the balance sheet growth has been less than most of us would expect given the economies given your market but im also appreciative of the derisking and call it the focus on the profitability regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 which has helped the ph nim free up the capital but maybe talk about the mediumterm outlook for those two areas thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so matt we have been extremely deliberate in allocating capital to those relationships that give us the appropriate riskadjusted return because at the end of the day thats what we think really is what our investors want us to do with a capital not just to grow but to grow appropriately to grow with the right return as just an example this year weve recycled billion worth of credit out of our core banking group that we could have add we could add an additional billion for the loan growth it wouldve been a suboptimal return these are customers that we seek to sell and offer more of our banking services so we can have a full relationship with great returns and we cant get that when it comes up for renewal we let it go and so were going to stick to that now that being said as you think about loan growth for us in the short and longterm is we should be gdp plus a little bit our expectation for gdp this coming year is slightly under as a matter of fact its in our estimate so we have low singledigits of loan growth expectations on an adjusted basis for and its because if we try to push too hard past gdp we think you make a bad credit decision so were going to be credibly disciplined we realize we need to grow were all about that growing earnings growing revenues and return and so its all off the delicate balance and how we do that appropriately matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it and just any guess on relative to kind of industry growth or kind of gdp growth as you think about mediumterm kind of loantodeposit growth rates john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well id say matt weve said consistently that we and david reiterated this if we want to grow with the economy plus a little recognizing that while the markets were in are good growth markets theyre also markets that historically have demonstrated a fair amount of volatility and so its important to us that we stay disciplined as david said focused on appropriate allocation of capital and we think growing with the economy plus a little is the right place for us mediumterm longerterm matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard you might be on mute we lost gerard operator gerard your line is open regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay why dont we go to the next question we lost gerard operator certainly your next question is from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey hello good morning guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc good morning i guess a followup question on cecl as ken mentioned your acl ratio moves up with your with your day one impact to over which seems pretty high given the risk profile of your loan book and the composition of your loan book the only banks who very few banks who have given day one impacts are above that level unless they have a much more consumer oriented exposure and i know a lot of things go into it i know you have more term loans in your ci book for example but i mean i guess how conservative do you think that estimate is it and as i if i look forward to the day two impact and you think about what you said david on mix it would seem how do i think about the loss content of whats coming on your books versus whats getting paid off because it would seem given your derisking that that reserve ratio could trend lower going forward or is that too aggressive of a comment or an expectation david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well you asked few questions let me see if i can break it down so the relative to others you really the mix is hugely important i suspect when we get to providing more granular disclosures by loan type and break that down so that you will have a better gauge as to what new production would cost and what benefit you might get for runoff of our loan portfolio so we dont we tried to get this right weve tightened up the range quite a bit between million and million thats again to our reserve today which includes a reserve for unfunded commitments to so i think what youre going to need some incremental disclosures to help you on a goforward basis well be providing that to you in a later point but we think the reserves that we have for cecl is pretty appropriate and we didnt do anything to be overly conservative or otherwise we just did what we thought the standard called for and were moving forward well all learn a little bit from each other as we go through the year and well be making decisions on how that might affect our business and production and pricing going forward saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i guess just following up like in terms of how should we be thinking about provisions going forward should we be thinking that a lifetime ratio is sort of appropriate we should be provisioning to maintain that level of reserve ratio going forward regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i think for the time being as i was trying to get to that point earlier is if you think about provisioning for the first thing you ought to think about is whats your chargeoff expectation for us next year then what is the loan growth net loan growth expectation for us next year weve given you guidance that says our net loans will be flat well grow on an adjusted basis but we have a runoff of our vehicle portfolio that will be working against balances there and then your third and so the third component would be what are you growing the mix makes a difference and will give you some more granular data later to help you there and then whats your expectation of the economic outlook from quartertoquarter and that could be that could change now we think the economy is going to be fairly stable this year thats our going in thought but that can change and so those are the roughly four pieces that you need to have in terms of projecting cecl provisioning saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it all right thats helpful thanks a lot operator operator instructions your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc regarding your expectation for positive operating leverage in can you help size up the magnitude or maybe give us just a little bit more color around it regarding the components and then also why not provide more detailed outlook around you previously have given full year expense growth and full year revenue targets whats different about this year that youre not giving that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well lets see if i can help you there so lets take the big component so nii which is twothirds of our revenue would be very hard to grow that this year with the low singledigit loan growth on an adjusted basis that we have given you and thats just the mere rate play the first half of rates being up off the december rate increase would be hard to replicate and then for the other third of our revenue nir weve given you a little bit of guidance in terms of what you can model we feel good about that growth from an expense standpoint we said wed be relatively stable from an expense standpoint and if you add all three of those up we will generate positive operating leverage so i think weve been reasonably explicit in terms of what how wed get there so you can play with the numbers from that standpoint regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks david and then to confirm on what you just said that relatively stable expectation for expenses that already factors in your it investments and what youre doing on the core systems front david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp absolutely john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i would underscore the point john that includes our continued investments in talent in markets and in technology were not adjusting our budgets at all and we believe we can continue to deliver stable expenses yearoveryear john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great got it all right thank you operator your final question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning im going to ask the capital question i know i always do on this call but i did want to understand how youre thinking about capital utilization not only in your base case assumption where youve got net loan growth flat in total but in an environment where things actually loan growth accelerates a little bit more maybe you should give us a sense as to do we just hold with this what i would consider a little bit of excess capital or is the pipeline of boltons robust enough to use some of this or do we anticipate a little bit more buyback this year thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so its always a good question on capital just to reiterate how we think about utilization of the capital we generated so first off were getting close to our target we laid out common equity tier today estimated on our current target of as weve mentioned before that has basis points of the management buffer our quantitative calculations set would lead us to believe we need about common equity tier as we think about first and foremost our capital there for us to grow appropriately organically in particular and so we have low singledigit loan growth expectations and you can do some quick math and see well use a little bit of capital from that standpoint regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 weve targeted the to of our earnings to go and be paid to our shareholders in the form of the dividend so you have that piece we have from time to time done some bolton acquisitions those use capital indiscernible but its certainly something if we see opportunities john just talked about we look at different things from time to time and if we can deploy that capital in a meaningful manner that helps grow our longterm business well do so and then frankly the last thing we do is share repurchases we arent crazy about doing share repurchases but we also dont want to continue to have excess capital so if we cant deploy it in a meaningful manner through organic loan growth bolton acquisitions then well give that back to the shareholder in the form of share repurchases like weve done this past several years so i think those are the pieces that you need to have betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay is there anything on the bolton front i mean youve had a nice pace over the past year or so and i know you mentioned the fee outlook several times so is the fee outlook with the current footprint that you have or does the fee outlook could the fee outlook be enhanced by incremental acquisitions maybe you could speak a little bit to that john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i mean we continue to look at opportunities whether it be investments in capital markets capabilities wealth management buying more servicing rights not a great time to do that today but were still looking there are other capabilities potentially that we have some interest in we look at loan portfolios from time to time and those are things that well continue to do as we think about how we invest in the excess capital we have in other parts of our business that will help us grow over time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator okay your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you i apologize about that hi guys i apologize can you guys share with us youve done a really good job over the last three years or so on being very conservative in your underwriting standards and of course has resulted in more modest loan growth in some of your peers and im not asking you to comment on your peers underwriting standards but can you just give us some color in commercial ci that is in commercial real estate regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 what kind of underwriting are you guys seeing that youre just not comfortable with that maybe some of your peers are john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp ive asked ronnie smith who heads our corporate banking group to respond gerard ronald g smith a senior executive vice president head of corporate banking group regions financial corp hey gerard good morning you know and you may have heard this earlier but we are really focused back in on the relationship side of things gerard simply because we believe that when you have a broad and a deep relationship you become more meaningful to that client and it gives you the ability to weather through whatever storms might be out there when you are meaningful to them have the opportunity to get in early and really client selectivity on the front side is so important but understanding the complete flow of business that they have the complete demand that they have with banking services is really where we try to be focused and i would also say that we look historically at how well companies have gone through the cycles really strongly lean into the management their capability how they performed through the last cycle and then of course use the standard underwritings that i wont go into the details around that today but those are the high level pieces of how we try to look at the risk that we take on when we go through client selectivity the only thing i would add to that is that specifically to your question i think the what i most consistently hear from our bankers is loantovalue so our willingness to provide as much capital as a customer may want tends to be the differentiator as an example we may want to loan loantovalue on a project then the customer can get or from someone else so thats a function of a variety of factors but that tends to be the most significant differentiator in todays marketplace barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp gerard this is barb godin i would also add that we stay very very close to our customers our people in the field do an excellent job with that and we are touching bases with them sometimes on a weekly basis but often monthly certainly quarterly and making sure that if theres any early warning signs of any risks that are out there that were on top of it early because as you know if you can get on top of a problem early youve got a lot more solutions you can give than when you have to wait until theres nothing left to do but to exit the relationship gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just as a followup question obviously youre one of the socalled extended cycle banks so youll be going through a full ccar this year david are you expecting any differences between this year and what you did last year last year obviously you didnt go through it being an extended cycle bank should we expect any kind of differences david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah gerard we go through stress tests all the time internally yes this is one that we have to fill out the form and go through the review process with our regulatory supervisors we are awaiting the instructions for that were looking to see if there are any changes there was an article i think this morning or yesterday i cant regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 remember in ph the banker regarding the expectations where some changes in ccar for this year things like if youre in stress do you have to continue with anticipated share repurchases at the same pace in a stressed environment i mean thats something we would not do so we were hoping that that gets changed in the rules or would we continue to grow the portfolio at the same pace that we are now if were in a stressed environment so those are two pretty big important things that were hoping might get changed in the rules but other than that understanding what losses are i mean if this is a good exercise for the industry for us individually and for our regulatory supervisors and so were ready to go and well be submitting that plan in first part of april gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you as always david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp youre welcome operator there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to john turner for closing remarks john m turner jr
