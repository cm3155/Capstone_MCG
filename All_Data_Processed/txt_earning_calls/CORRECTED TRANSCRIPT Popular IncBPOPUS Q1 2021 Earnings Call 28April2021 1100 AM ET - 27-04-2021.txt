capital actions that we intend to execute this year these actions include a increase in the companys quarterly common stock dividend from to per share and a common stock repurchase program of up to million these actions evidenced the strength of our capital position which allows us to return capital to our shareholders while we continue to invest in our franchise and serve the needs of our customers please turn to slide our quarterly net income of million was million higher than the fourth quarter these results were million higher than the same quarter last year both quarters were impacted albeit in opposite direction due to changes in economic forecast due to the pandemic and its impact ph under season first quarter results were primarily driven by million benefit in the provision for credit losses as well as higher revenues the increase in net interest income was driven by higher ppp related fees and increase in our investment portfolio and lower deposit costs our noninterest income increased due to higher mortgage banking income driven by higher msr valuation credit quality trends were positive in the quarter with lower npls lower npl inflows and lower net chargeoffs our results reflect the ongoing rebound in economic activity experienced over the past few quarters in large part due to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus as well as our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk management please turn to slide for an update on ppp and other operational matters with respect to the ppp program we have funded loans totaling billion in both rounds in round two we have originated nearly loans for million of the loans originated in round one close to million or have been forgiven as of the end of the first quarter in puerto rico as of march we had funded of all pp loans that have been originated on the island in both programs we have seen an acceleration in the adoption of digital channels active users on mi banco platform in puerto rico have grown by since march we captured of deposits in the first quarter through digital channels while slightly lower than the observed in the fourth quarter it was considerably higher than the registered in the first quarter of last year we believe that these trends may adjust downward somewhat as the economy continues to reopen but we expect them to remain higher at prepandemic levels finally our customer base in puerto rico continues to grow increasing by in the first quarter to reach more than million unique customers please turn to slide for an update on the current macroeconomic environment in puerto rico in the first quarter business trends and customer activity continue to improve building upon the momentum seen in the second half of as many of the restrictions that were in place were gradually loosened vaccinations in puerto rico have progressed along a similar trajectory as in the mainland while the number of the cases on the island has increased in recent weeks covidrelated hospitalizations remain below national levels employment levels have improved but are still lower compared to last year total nonfarm employment has increased by since december but remains below the march level popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 new auto sales have remained robust with sales of units in the first quarter this is the second highest quarterly level only exceeded by the prior quarters record level cement sales increased by in the first quarter as compared to the yearago period which is the highest level since at least the tourist and hospitality sector continued to improve with much of the world travel limited puerto rico has become a popular destination for mainland residents during the pandemic airport traffic is improving at a rapid pace while ph usa arrivals were down from the yearago period arrivals during the month of march were higher than the previous year hotel demand has also picked up significantly the current hotel booking rate for the remainder of is above the booking level at the same time in which was a record year for tourism in puerto rico within populars clientele credit and debit card sales in dollars increased by compared to last years first quarter and has been higher than prepandemic levels auto loan originations at bppr increased by compared to the yearago period similarly we have continued to see strength in the housing market while the dollar volume mortgage originations at bppr decreased by compared to last quarter it has increased versus the first quarter of all in all we are extremely pleased with our results for the first quarter and encouraged by the economic outlook ill now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financials carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide todays earnings press release details various things from the fourth quarter net interest income for the first quarter was million an increase of million from q4 driven mainly by ppp loan activity q1 net interest income increased by million to million this was primarily driven by higher mortgage banking income by million due to a positive quarteroverquarter variance in msr valuation of million plus million higher net earnings from portfolio investments held under the equity method the provision for the first quarter decreased by million to a benefit of million lidio will expand later total operating expenses were million in the quarter down slightly from q4 the fourth quarter included million in expenses related to branch closure actions at popular bank as well as the reclassification out of the expense category of million for unfunded loan commitments which moved to the provision for credit losses excluding these two items the net increase in expenses in the first quarter would have been million the adjusted variances for the fourth quarter included a million increase in personnel cost due to higher commission incentives and other employee compensation expenses that are tied to the financial performance of the corporation which were partially offset by lower professional fees by million on lower advisory costs which tend to ramp up as the year progresses and business promotion expenses that were down million due to lower seasonal advertising expenses for we continue to expect average quarterly expenses to be between million and million continued outperformance as a result of improved credit and business sentiment could lead to higher expenses later in the year especially in incentives commissions and bonuses popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 our effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to in the fourth quarter for we expect the effective tax rate to be between and this is higher than the range indicated last quarter as we now anticipate generating a higher proportion of taxable income this year please turn to slide net interest income for the quarter was million an increase of million from q4 nii on a taxable equivalent basis was million million higher than the fourth quarter the primary drivers of the increase in taxable equivalent nii were higher interest income from commercial loans by million mostly driven by an increase in ppp interest income and fees of million and lower deposit cost primarily at popular bank these items were partially offset by two fewer days in the quarter which reduced nii by roughly million deposits grew by billion in the quarter this increase was mostly seen in bpprs commercial and retail segments nim improved by three basis points to in q1 on a taxable equivalent basis net interest margin was an increase of basis points the higher margin is mostly due to higher ppp related fees and lower deposit cost total loan yields increased by basis points in q1 as a result of higher ppp related income of million compared to million in the fourth quarter due to the accelerated recognition of fee income upon forgiveness these loans yielded approximately in this quarter compared to last quarter the remaining unamortized portion of ppp fees is approximately million of which correspond to the second round at this time we believe that most of the first round ppp loans will be forgiven during the second and third quarter of this year and a majority of the second round ppp loans by the middle of next year we expect margins to be stable the rest of the ultimate result will depend on our asset mix round two ppp originations and the speed at which these sba guaranteed loans are forgiven as of the end of the first quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion in line with last quarter these balances do not include the most recent cares act federal stimulus of per person which were received in early april the government of puerto rico is quickly disbursing this benefit to residents in the island in the first half of the year additional federal stimulus and tax revenues will increase public deposit balances which depending on the amount and timing will be an important factor in the corporations net interest margin we continue to expect early deposit balances to come down over time driven by the restructuring of the public sector debt and the eventual restart of current debt service our ending loan balances decreased by million in the quarter the ppp portfolio accounted for million of the decrease ppp loans issued in the first round dropped by million while second round disbursement were million we continue to see strong demand and net portfolio growth in auto loans and leases while all of our auto loan portfolios are either flat or have decreased since the fourth quarter we expect loan balances will continue to be impacted by ppp forgiveness as well as limited demand resulting from unprecedented levels of client liquidity as such we do not expect overall loan growth to materialize until next year when demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace forgiveness of ppp loans please turn to slide our capital levels remained strong relative to mainland peers and wellcapitalized regulatory requirements our common equity tier ratio in q1 was or basis points from q4 as ignacio mentioned at the start of this call our announced capital plan includes two actions first an increase of popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 populars quarterly common dividend of or to per share we expect our board to declare the dividend in q2 for payment in the third quarter secondly we will execute the common stock repurchase program of up to million while our recent buyback programs have been executed via asrs the mechanism for the implementation of this buyback is still under consideration we will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital during the remainder of and in future periods however we do not expect further dividend increases or common stock repurchases this year the filing and execution of our capital plan for was delayed by one quarter we now plan to return to our normal capital planning schedule hopefully resulting in an announcement of populars capital action no later than our january webcast tangible book value decreased by per share to this decrease was driven by lower community with realized gains in investments partially offset by our quarterly net income our return on tangible equity was in the first quarter with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer corporate risk management popular inc thank you carlos and good morning during the first quarter of the year the corporation exhibited improved credit quality metrics and lower credit cost driven by the improving economic environment as a result of the unprecedented amount of government stimulus in response to the pandemic notwithstanding our positive results given the uncertainty and the economic disruption caused by the pandemic we continue to monitor the impact of covid on our entire loan portfolio please turn to slide number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an npl decrease of million coupled with oreo decrease of million the npl decrease was mainly in puerto rico driven by lower mortgage npls of million reflecting improved postmoratorium payment activity construction npls decreased by million mostly due to a previously reserved loan that was partially charged off at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio was compared to in the prior quarter please turn to slide number to discuss npl inflows compared to the fourth quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans decreased by million driven by a decrease of million in puerto rico mainly due to lower mortgage npl inflows by million in the us npl inflows increased by million mostly related to a construction loan that reached days during its renewal process but was current at the end of the quarter turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or annualized basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter in puerto rico net chargeoff decreased by million primarily driven by lower commercial by million as the prior quarter included impairment chargeoff from previously reserved loans consumer decreased by million mainly due to recoveries of million related to the sale during the quarter of previously fully chargeoff loans the decreases were partially offset by higher construction net chargeoff by popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 million related to the reserve loan that was partially charged off during the quarter in the us net chargeoffs were flat quarteroverquarter the corporations allowance for credit losses decreased by million to million driven mainly by the improved economic outlook and improved credit quality as discussed further in the following slide the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio decreased to from in the prior quarter excluding payment protection program loans and guaranteed mortgage loans this ratio is the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to npls held in portfolio was compared to in the fourth quarter of last year please turn to slide number to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in allowance for credit losses during the quarter the allowance for credit losses decreased by million when compared to the previous quarter variances were driven by changes to the economic outlook qualitative reserves as well as portfolio credit quality and mix our acl framework utilizes probability weights of different scenarios to our estimation process we combine moodys analytics s1 baseline and s3 scenarios while a strong recovery is evident we remain cautious of adverse outcomes given uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the puerto rico governments ability to utilize the available federal assistance as a result well continue to assign to the baseline scenario with the highest probability followed by the more pessimistic s3 scenario our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with unemployment rate and gdp being the largest drivers the current baseline scenario shows improvement in both gdp growth and unemployment rate when compared to the previous estimates the forecasted gdp growth for is now for the us and for puerto rico while the forecasted unemployment rate average for is now for the us and for puerto rico the change in the macroeconomic scenario caused acl to decrease by million during the quarter we added million in qualitative research related to our commercial real estate exposure in the us total portfolio changes caused acl to decrease by million portfolio changes include fluctuations in credit quality and volume mix to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited improved credit quality metrics during the first quarter aided by payment deferrals and government stimulus we will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemicrelated risks and changes in the economic outlook with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates our colleagues continue to achieve impressive results under very challenging circumstances popular started off with positive momentum driven by strong earnings improved credit quality record deposit levels continued customer growth and planned capital actions we are optimistic about the economic environment and our opportunities for the remainder of the year in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to covid puerto rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that are yet to be disbursed and which we expect will now start flowing at a faster pace popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 their combined impact should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years and we are well positioned to benefit from such activity the pace of vaccination is also encouraging as the data has demonstrated massive vaccination is the key to controlling the virus i am proud of how we have been collaborating with local health authorities and community organizations by lending our facilities and personnel to help accelerate vaccination efforts in puerto rico i am particularly happy to report that more than of our employees in puerto rico have now received at least one dose of the vaccine we still have more work to do in our other markets and we are committed to encouraging and facilitating vaccination opportunities for all of our colleagues our team is focused on supporting our customers and our communities through the transition to a postcovid reality were in a strong position to contribute to that recovery and leverage the opportunities that lie ahead we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the question i guess starting off as the big picture on puerto rican gdp i believe that baseline number is looking for if you could just talk and kind of put that in context when was the last time we saw a number like that for puerto rico ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc wow im having trouble i mean i dont think weve seen that since maybe carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes exactly the first few years of brock is probably last time that happened lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer corporate risk management popular inc yes a long time ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 thats kind of what i figured i guess given your market share and continued momentum in growing customers could be gearing to this recovery be greater than what you project where you really dont sound like we should expect material loan growth overpower the ppp runoff until next year could it be sooner than that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i mean hopefully it will be sooner maybe we could see something at the end of year but it takes time for this money to come to the economy and when we expect the pace of the funds to flow that is because i think the government of puerto rico with the federal government have agreed on procedures for much of this money but that doesnt mean that doesnt take time to work out for example most of these projects require some kind of a bidding process and now youll see the government start the bidding process and whatnot so we believe its going to take time for that money to flow and again there is such a large amount of liquidity in the system still that both consumers and businesses have a lot of liquidity so while maybe well be surprised but we do have the runoff coming from ppp we still have the western portfolio also running off a bit so were trying to be prudent in what were projecting but in general we do believe there will be loan growth eventually just hard to predict when we will start to see it carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc its more an issue of timing than whether its coming brock we feel that it is in the past in terms of the short term the liquidity and the paying off the ppp probably outweighed what we indiscernible brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay ill step back in the queue thank you operator the next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone how are you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning doing well carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 ignacio could you share with us maybe an update on the puerto rican debt restructuring i think there was a proposal maybe made in the beginning of march of this year on the public debt the billion or so and then also the public pensions and then in addition to that any updates on whats going on with prepa and the restructuring of that debt ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc okay the public debt is moving along i mean the i was going to say the arbitration but its really a mediation the mediation has been going forward and it looks like theyre getting pretty close to an agreement that a significant amount of creditors could sign on to i think that the fiscal board has put a goal of trying to get this done in which would be optimistic but that said i think theyve made significant progress the pension is very much tied into that deal because obviously the restructuring plan currently at least the rumors weve heard and the different elements of it will require some reduction in pensions albeit a small one so i think thats being negotiated now i think thats probably the most important sticking point in how do you resolve that and can the government given that its revenues have done better than expected and the economy doing better than expected can the government perhaps make some of that up in another way so well see im relatively optimistic that theyre getting close to a deal i wouldnt predict it will happen this year because its just so complicated but theyre making progress on the prepa restructuring i dont know where that is right now i think the most pressing issue right now is the fiscal im sorry the court has deployed a motion to approve the payments to luma under the contract they had approved some initial payments for the transition phase but luma is supposed to take over the distribution and transmission starting june and those payments have to be approved in the bankruptcy proceeding and they are filing the motions from both sides of the government and the board asking that those payments be approved and one of the electrical workers union opposing it i hope that gives you some color gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes no very good no thank you now can we now take it to the next step lets assume at some point it is restructured the public debt and they resolve the public pension issue as well can you guys walk us through how you think the deposits that are now sitting in there i think carlos you said they are about billion how do you see those working their way down once the approvals are all in place they start debt service again have you given that any thought carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well we do not know gerard the exact execution plan for the restructuring but of the things we have seen imply that there would be an upfront onetime payment of something in the magnitude of billion now a good chunk of that payment will probably be funded from the accounts the government has in popular not necessarily all they have accounts in other banks as well but its a high probability that a good chunk of it will come from us popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 so if that were to happen then well see other deposits go down by some amount by billion billion and whatever that is that outflow of deposits will not have a liquidity effect in popular because as you know all deposits need to be fully collateralized so we get our collateral back and we said that we will replay whatever we want to do so its not a liquidity event but in this interest rate environment its also not a material net interest income event because a lot of those funds are in cash or cash equivalents earning very little but it is a material event on our balance sheet because our balance sheet is a little outsized right now because of the bank built this deposit and when this deposit leaves the balance sheet will start looking closer to a normal course of business balance sheet obviously the departure of this significant amount of liquidity would also have an effect on our nim gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just finally on capital as you know the federal reserve came out and were going to go to the stress capital buffer construct for our largest banks on the mainland here starting in the third quarter and as part of that construct as we all know theres not going to be the need for the preapproval of these banks for their share repurchase plans and dividend increases when you look at your relationships with the fed and i know youre not part of obviously the dfas process that the big banks go through do you think you will be relieved of any preapproval process on your capital action plans going forward in or do you think youll still need the preapprovals that youve gotten in the past assuming youve had to have them in the past ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes i think what weve done with the fed is weve established a good relationship and technically they dont approve they do not object i think is the word i would weve been careful to say i think in our releases so i think we are going to continue that process its worked for us we share with them our capital plan we tell them what were thinking and generally theyve become much better at responding much faster than in the past so i think its worked for us i think well stick to that process gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question is from arren cyganovich of citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc yes i guess just following up on the debt restructuring beyond just the deposits going out how do you expect that to kind of flow through to the island in terms of either new business development or new business and how would that impact popular popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i personally believe its going to be a positive i mean a lot of good things can happen if we can get the restructures its one more stripe off the tiger i guess first of all it will show the world that puerto rico has is moving forward we had a lot of negative headlines in the past i think were going to start seeing more positive headlines that will be one obviously itll be easier for puerto rico to predict its future and build out its budget priorities now with how much you can count so i think its just a big positive psychological but its also a big positive from a planning and priority strategic priorities and political consent well now know how much money we can count on so i think its going to be a big positive arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and then with the loan growth or i guess loans expected to be kind of flat this year what is the balance of your current ppp loans and excluding the ppp would you have at least modest growth expected for the year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc the balance is about million i think in the first the ppp1 and million in ppp2 and so whether we see some growth ex that will depend on when they get forgiven right because if it evolves on the second phase wait until the beginning of next year then whats going to be leaving the rest of this year is somewhat million change but a lot of ppp remember the second phase of ppp was designed to have a lot smaller loans and that is what it has in it and the smaller loans actually can take advantage of this more simplified forgiveness process so its not impossible that we might see the forgiveness or the second phase accelerate as i mentioned at this point in time we think its going to be the first half next year but if the clients get their things on roll it could be earlier so it will depend on this whole chunk of million that we dont know exactly what the time its going to be ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc and we are seeing strong as weve mentioned several times strong growth in areas like auto loans so definitely thats a portfolio thats growing i think we can expect more momentum in the mainland also i think south florida is basically back to normal and we believe that new york will come back faster than most people expect so those are areas that were looking at also closely arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you operator okay operator instructions the next question is from alex twerdahl of piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 hey good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning alex alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co first off just a couple of questions around some modeling stuff as i look at nii carlos maybe you can talk about some of the levers that you have or that youve been doing to see nii actually increase this year even if we dont get any change in rates or anything like that for example i think you put on some securities or purchased some securities in the first quarter what was the timing of those purchases or the rates et cetera and then as i look at your sort of debt it seems to me like theres over billion of higher cost in debt including some trust preferred thats out there are there some opportunities out there to retire some of that debt that could actually help nii over the next couple of quarters carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes you are right alex in that we did some movement of cash into the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter as you recall we did some more of that also in the first quarter in the first quarter it was largely the latter part of the quarter so while you see the balances going up a lot of the impact in net income of that movement will actually happen in the second quarter but you want to reduce the first quarter to its core the core is just ppp ppp is what made the difference between margins stay inside from maybe even going down a little bit versus going up so that will continue to be true in the second quarter and then as you know the other big big elephant in the room for us is asset mix if we depending on the level and magnitude of influx of deposits that will have a big say in our margin as well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co and if we just boil it down take out ppp right because thats obviously getting volatile and take out cash and maybe just ignore the nim and just look at nii for those securities purchases what was the theres billion if im not mistaken what was kind of the blended yield on that that could potentially help a little bit in the second quarter carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i dont remember exactly i think it was probably certainly under thats probably the range in which it was alex but dont remember that so that fees goes up from ph basis points to something probably under i do remember that those are mostly treasuries they are tax free from our point of view popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 but the other piece of the puzzle is of course all the runoffs that were having from the investment portfolio is higher yielding stuff that keeps running up so is better than basis points but you know if you have stuff running off at this time was it it still weighs on the nim on nii alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it and then what about the trust preferreds or other higher costing debt is there an opportunity to retire that at some point in carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we will continue to look at opportunities to manage our capital for the remainder of the year i mean i think our statement stands for itself alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then as i just circling back to the loan growth question obviously its a pretty tough current as when we get this year but as you kind of line up some of the things that are going to be happening over the next year or so as in bankruptcy rebuilding the power grid rebuilding the housing stock resurgence in tourism the end of the expanded unemployment benefits maybe putting some people back into the workforce it seems like loan growth as we look into it might not just trickle back on but just really explode out of the gates is there anything with that thinking that is flawed and what are you guys doing to prepare for a potential just huge rampup in loan growth next year if you think thats possible ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i think we have the resources and talking about the human and technical resources to handle that the loan sizes in puerto rico have grown over the years so were expecting that a lot of that will be in larger loans and thats something thats a bit more efficient to handle were looking at the different industries that have potential for growth were talking closely to our clients we are seeing a lot of renewed interest from mainland investors coming to puerto rico looking for opportunities and were getting good referrals from people that know us so we are not just waiting for people to come into our office were trying to predict whats going to happen in the future were talking to people asking what they expect their needs are going to be so really i think were ready we just need to see it materialize and as i said in my remarks were in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities that we really see are coming alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it thanks for taking my questions operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to ignacio alvarez for closing remarks popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks again for joining us today
