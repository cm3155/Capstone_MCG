chief executive officer us bancorp thanks george good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call ill begin on slide in the first quarter we reported earnings per share of which includes per share of charges related to the mufg union bank acquisition excluding those notable items earnings per share was we achieved record net revenue of billion for the quarter following our successful close of union bank acquisition in december of first quarter results reflected a full years benefit of the acquired franchise continued growth in earning assets net interest margin expansion and higher noninterest income led by stronger commercial product and mortgage banking fee revenues slide details our reported and adjusted income statement results as well as the end of period and average balances and other performance metrics on the right you will see the credit quality remains strong but is starting to normalize as expected our chargeoff ratio of basis points as adjusted is well below precovid levels and reflective of our disciplined risk management culture the cet1 ratio our binding regulatory constraint was at the end of the quarter and is consistent with our target capital ratio we expect to exceed later this year as we accrete capital back quickly over the next few quarters and continue to focus on riskweighted asset optimization initiatives slide provides key performance metrics excluding notable items our return on average asset was and our return on average common equity was our return on tangible common equity was on an adjusted basis us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 slide provides both the highlevel timeline and general update on our planned conversion of union bank integration efforts have been progressing well and we remain on track for a successful main systems conversion over the upcoming memorial day weekend we anticipate a full transition of all accounts by the second half of the year turning to slide the industry disruption early in march has reinforced the importance of maintaining a well diversified business with an appropriate risk profile we maintain a resilient and diversified deposit base over half of our deposits are insured and of the uninsured deposits are retail or operational in nature our diversified funding sources ample liquidity levels and strong credit quality supported by disciplined underwriting standards are all hallmarks of our approach to risk management ill now turn the call over to terry who can provide more detail on the balance sheet strength and the first quarter earnings results terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy turning to slide a key strength of the bank is our welldiversified deposit base which remains a stable source of lowcost funding as a reminder following the completion of our acquisition of union bank last quarter our end of period deposits totaled billion including approximately billion of deposits from union bank as we discussed last quarter billion of union bank acquired deposits were transitory in nature with billion returned to mufg in the fourth quarter and an additional billion that moved back to mufg in the first quarter of this year in addition billion of acquired deposits were included in the branch sale or related to ph peer point a broker depositgathering mechanism that we discontinued importantly prior to the events of march we saw expected deposit outflow largely consistent with seasonal patterns reflective of our business mix including our large trust business from march through the end of the quarter deposit balances were relatively stable down only as inflows from new customers were slightly offset by the impact of clients diversifying their deposits and seeking yield in money market funds consistent with broader industry trends during this period we saw an increase in money market funds of approximately billion within our wealth management and investment services businesses we expect the competition for deposits to remain high for the industry in our cumulative deposit beta through the first quarter was approximately and we expect that to increase to about by the end of this rate cycle generally in line with our previous expectations slide provides additional detail on the composition of our highlydiversified deposit base as the slide shows our deposit balances are composed of a broad mix of consumer corporate and commercial customers that we support with an expansive branch distribution network and mobile capabilities across our national footprint our deposit base reflects the wide range of customers and industries that our companies serve at march our percent of insured deposits to total deposits was approximately of our uninsured deposits are composed of operational wholesale trust and retail deposits that are stickier either because they are contractually bound or tied to treasury management services and trust activities provided to corporate and institutional clients combined with our consumer base deposits the stability of our funding source is sound moving to slide us banks total available liquidity as of march was billion representing of our uninsured deposits as of march as of december our liquidity coverage ratio was as mentioned our strong debt ratings reflect our diversified business profile wellcollateralized credit exposure healthy capital and us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 liquidity profiles and disciplined assetliability management framework these attributes work in concert with our strong balance sheet optimization and management practices to ensure strength and stability of our balance sheet slide provides details on the composition of our investment securities portfolio over the last five quarters and well ahead of the most recent banking disruption we reduced the size of our investment securities portfolio from to of total assets while increasing cash levels in preparation for and as part of the completion of our acquisition of union bank we repositioned our balance sheet by selling fixed rate loans and investment securities paid off borrowings and increased cash balances in response to economic uncertainty industry dynamics rising interest rates and increased market volatility at march approximately of the securities in our investment portfolio are backed andor sponsored by the us federal government with of securities designated as heldtomaturity and designated as available forsale further availableforsale unrealized losses as a percentage of our investment security portfolio improved in the first quarter and total aoci improved by on a linked quarter basis turning to slide as a reminder following the completion of our acquisition of union bank our cet1 capital ratio declined from at the end of the third quarter of to as of december which reflected the impacts of balance sheet optimization and purchase accounting adjustments that will accrete back into capital over the next few years strategically we continue to be encouraged about the financial merits of this deal and the synergistic benefits we expect to realize as a combined institution as andy mentioned earlier our cet1 capital ratio at march was the basis point increase from year end reflected basis points of capital accretion offset by the transitional impact of cecl of basis points as of march we expect to accrete approximately basis points to basis points of capital per quarter as we complete the union bank integration and realize cost synergies importantly this does not include the impacts of planned rwa optimization initiatives mentioned earlier turning to slide total end of period loans were billion which was flat on a linked quarter basis and up yearoveryear commercial real estate loans represent approximately of our total loan portfolio with cre office exposure representing approximately of total loans and only of total commitments leveraged lending balances are not a significant component of the loan portfolio slide shows credit quality trends which continue to be strong but as expected are starting to normalize across the portfolio the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at march compared with at december and a year ago our first quarter net chargeoffs of as adjusted increased basis points versus the fourth quarter level of as adjusted and was higher when compared to the first quarter of which was a level of our allowance for credit losses as of march totaled billion or of period end loans as the chart on the upperright side of this slide demonstrates our credit performance through the cycle serves as a key differentiator for the bank slide provides a detailed earnings summary for the quarter in the first quarter we earned per diluted share excluding of notable items related to the recent acquisition of union bank slide highlights revenue trends for the quarter net revenue totaled billion in the first quarter which included a full quarter of revenue contribution from union bank of million primarily representing net interest us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 income net interest income grew on a linked quarter basis and yearoveryear driven by earning asset growth and continued net interest margin expansion which benefited from rising interest rates noninterest income as adjusted increased compared to the fourth quarter driven by higher commercial product revenue mortgage banking revenue and trust and investment management fees partially offset by losses of million from securities sales turning to slide adjusted noninterest expense for the company totaled billion in the first quarter including million from union bank noninterest expense as adjusted increased on a linked quarter basis largely driven by the impact of two additional months of union banks operating expenses core deposit intangible amortization and higher compensation and other noninterest expenses i will now provide second quarter and updated full year forwardlooking guidance on slide starting with the second quarter of sic guidance we expect average earning assets of between billion and billion in the second quarter and a net interest margin of approximately total revenue as adjusted is estimated to be in the range of billion to billion including approximately million of purchase accounting accretion total noninterest expense as adjusted is expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of approximately million of core deposit intangible amortization related to union bank our tax rate is expected to be approximately on a taxable equivalent basis todate we have incurred million in merger and integration costs and anticipated charges of between and anticipate charges of between million and million for the second quarter we continue to estimate total merger and integration costs of approximately billion consistent with earlier guidance i will now provide updated guidance for the full year for average earning assets are now expected to be in the range of billion to billion we expect the net interest margin to be between to for the full year total revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of approximately million of full year purchase accounting accretion total noninterest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of approximately million of core deposit intangible amortization related to union bank our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is now expected to be approximately we continue to expect to have million to billion of merger and integration charges in i will now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry events of the past few weeks have certainly raised questions about the overall health of the banking industry and the economic outlook the business of banking involves taking balanced risks and these risks must be carefully managed

challenging times and i am more confident than ever in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional client service and superior product offerings in a rapidly changing environment well now open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions one moment here well go to scott siefers piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi scott terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey lots of noise in the deposit flows in the first quarter i guess moving forward what would your expectations be for total deposit flows or balances and then the mix of noninterestbearing to total as we sort of get through this cycle terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 yeah our expectation is that if you end up just looking at the industry theres going to be pressure on deposits and high competition we think well fare quite well with respect to that to the extent that we see changes in deposits it will be kind of based upon that competition so but i would say relatively stable and then coming to your second question the mix of nibs as an example in roughly fourth quarter ph was in that ballpark its and we think its kind of hitting that kind of stable level keeping in mind that we have a lot of operational deposits tied to our both our corporate and our corporate trust businesses and that kind of helps to sustain it so its a combination of things scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then i was hoping we could talk for a second about just the categorization and when you guys would expect to be a category ii bank i think theres a lot of chatter going on especially in light of that report from a couple of days ago so maybe just in sort of clear terms when would you expect to be a category ii bank will that be due to your asset size or thanks to the feds flexibility to designate you as one and then how would you guys get there by that time terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah our trajectory with respect to category ii is no earlier than the end of and that will be i think thatll be more driven by whether the fed makes that decision or not rather than asset size again as we kind of manage the company were going to be continued to be very focused on profitable loan growth and things like that so we get there when we get there but that our expectation right now is no sooner than end of r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and you guys feel like youre prepared to get there by that time basically terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah itll be a combination of a couple of things we talked about the just the capital generation from earnings and of course that is helped by the union bank transaction and then were very focused on capital management we have to be just because of the category ii and well be very focused on riskweighted asset optimization and making sure that were focused on profitable growth r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thank you very much operator next well go to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning erika andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i guess the question for usb is i dont think your investors doubt the through the cycle credit outperformance or even the ppnr strength its wellnoted that the adjustment to your revenue outlook was very minimal relative to peers i think the big question that investors have is youre starting from cet1 you note earnings power and capital organic capital generation of basis points to basis points but as we anticipate cat ii and youre telling us that the fed could decide and not your asset size necessarily could decide when that line is what is the new endpoint of at cet1 in your view because as we think about going into that new category i dont think investors think that to is the right bogey and then the sort of the subquestion to that andy is is your priority getting to a higher capital level faster and if so how are you thinking about dividend growth this year andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so erika good question and so im just going to go from the beginning i think that would be helpful so as you know we were well above and came down to as a result of the union bank transaction the union bank transaction is a terrific transaction were exceeding our revenue expectations we are coming under on our expense expectations the accretion is greater than we expected so the value to the franchise is positive for sure as we think about the category ii i have three or four factors i think about number one is the earnings accretion that we talked about which is strong and growing and will become even more accretive as we get through the cost takeout component of the union bank integration number two is we have a number of initiatives across the board for riskweighted asset optimization those are things like credit transfers risk transfers a number of things to optimize the balance sheet that i think we ought to be focused on and are very focused on to your question and i think with those two things as i mentioned we expect to exceed by the end of this year that coupled with our aoc sic aoci burndown and additional accretion as we go into makes me comfortable that well we are prepared with whatever event occurs as it relates to category ii in the timing as terry mentioned no later no earlier than the end of terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah a couple of things that i would maybe add because thats right on coming back to aoci that burn will be kind of a function of a lot of different things we have been very proactive in terms of repositioning the afs portfolio looking at assets sales and securitization or asset sales security sales et cetera us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 to kind of give you some sense the duration of that investment portfolio the afs portfolio has gone from a little over in the fourth quarter to about in at the end of the first quarter so were going to continue to shorten the duration and thats going to help us with respect to managing aoci and then in addition to that we have been essentially reducing the volatility of aoci to up interest rate environment through hedging activities so its a combination of a variety of things that were going to go through erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and is an appropriate new bogey as we think about the shift change for next year on cat ii andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so erika as you know the erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah the regulators are going through an analysis and process right now to think about how capital levels ought to be in the industry across the board with basel iv endgame and whatever changes to categorization occurs so we are waiting for that as you are to understand what the new environment will look like but the plan that we have in place is assuming what you what terry just discussed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and just if i could sneak one last one in one of your peers closest to you in size said that tlac was pretty much done invested i noticed that you mentioned your superior debt rating several times clearly the debt markets are still a little bit dislocated but how should we think about the wholesale funding stack from here i noticed on a period end basis shortterm borrowings went up by billion terry as you potentially anticipate a tlac how should we think about your senior debt issuance plans or will you sort of hold that level of borrowings until theres a little bit more less dislocation in the senior debt market terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again tlac is one of those things that were going to learn more as we kind of go over the course of the next months i think the real question is not whether or not tlac will exist because i do believe and were expecting that it will be something that gets put into place but how does that get calibrated for the regional banks reflecting the risk profile that we have relative to the gsibs and theres a wide range of estimates that are out there i when we end up looking at that i mean maybe one reasonable estimate would be based upon the foreign bank operators and kind of levels of tlac if that is the case for us i think it would be very manageable it would be within a range that we would be able to manage to and then that just gives us flexibility with respect to how we utilize that within the bank us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks erika operator and next we can go to mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well your pe if you believe consensus is close to and the markets around so your relative pe is one of the lowest in history so i would posit that the markets concerned about something other than earnings so going back i guess the simple question for you andy is will us bancorp need to issue capital and how confident are you about that and on the other side are buybacks potentially an option once you get to cet1 and the reason i bring that up is youve seen the front page articles in papers if youre forced to recognize the unrealized securities losses if you do a burndown and then people come up with all sorts of numbers and would you be forced to realize that you heard congress talk about these issues could you be forced to incorporate that as part of the current stress test could the fed force your hand sooner any color you can give whats your confidence that you might need to issue capital over the next year or so andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike so as i said im that is not part of our thinking as we sit today im confident that our earnings accretion our rwa optimization our aoc sic aoci burndown will all get us to a point that we will be at the appropriate capital levels and i can assure you that is a highfocus area for myself and the entire management team including terry so that is something were very focused on now as it relates to buybacks i will tell you as we all know theres a lot of capital changes that are likely to occur from a regulatory standpoint so were not going to do anything until we have more clarity around that which we us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 hope to have in the second half of the year but the focus on getting to the appropriate capital levels as quickly as possible accreting capital and building that capital base is priority one terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp and mike the thing that i would add to that were going to learn with respect to exactly how moving to category ii and the inclusion in unrealized losses gets incorporated into the ccar process just as a reminder we have a pretty significant amount of buffer that already exists just based upon our credit performance and our ppnr performance because of the earnings capacity we continue to reduce the volatility of aoci to rising interest rates were doing that through payfixed hedges and just shortening the duration and things that i talked about earlier i think theres very likely that they will incorporate a higher rate environment into the ccar process i will tell you that weve done lots of scenarios that look at a stagflation sort of environment and we actually perform better in that environment because the revenue streams tend to hold up given our mix of business et cetera so were taking a lot of that into consideration and like andy said we feel pretty confident that we dont have to go through a capital raise mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and the as far as this years stress test would they include the underlying securities losses since that would incorporate the ninequarter time horizon or no terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp no that is not required in this ccar analysis as a condition of the the way the deal was structured mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last short one your noninterestbearing deposits i know you brought that up before it certainly went down more than average this quarter but youre not guiding your margin down too much its at to versus i guess this quarter why wouldnt you be guiding that down even further given the decline in noninterestbearing deposits quarteroverquarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah its a couple of different things one is again if you end up just looking at the mix of total deposits we again think that total deposits will be relatively stable and that the mix of nib will be relatively stable around that up or down part of the decline this particular quarter ties back to some of the seasonal flows which are a part of our trust business but also the deposits that we knew were going to go out the door to mufg because of closing down the ph peer point et cetera all of those things kind of tie into the reason why we saw the decline this quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator next we can go to john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey john terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi john john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp yes hi good morning guys i wanted to ask on the idea of getting above by the end of the year on cet1 does that rely on the rwa mitigation opportunities or is that just kind of the basis points to basis points that terry mentioned before the rwa benefit is that something that will help you next year can you talk a little bit about that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah we think that the capital generation the accretion that well see of the basis points to basis points is core earnings capability so it does not rely on those rwas so the rwa optimization that we will go through will be above and beyond that its a part of that overall capital strategy that andy talked about earlier john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp the benefits of that should happen and help you towards the end of this year maybe into next year as you work towards the end of capital target terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah itll help us both this year as well as into next year absolutely john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp as you know john weve been kind of preparing for cat ii for well over a year we put a lot of things in place in the third and fourth quarter we took some actions in the fourth quarter and well utilize a lot of those tools if you will as part of the rwa optimization process that were going to go through us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp yes and just to clarify terry this hasnt happened prior to the end of even with the fed right the fed would tell you on january that it would take effect by the end of right so its not like theyre going to indiscernible correct terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp that is correct john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and then any idea of the pace of aoci burndown obviously the aoci came down this quarter with the help of rates but in a world where rates arent coming down whats the natural kind of burnoff pace that you might expect for that over a year or two any help on that and just kind of reminding us of the duration again terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well again the duration of the afs portfolio right now is about years so just if you kind of take that into consideration the burndown will still be fairly reasonable even without interest rates and again weve put some hedges into place in order to dampen the effect of rising interest rates with respect to aoci john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john operator next we can go to john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning john us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the back to the rwa optimization can you maybe give us a little more color on what youre looking at there i know you mentioned credit transfers and risk transfers but maybe if you can kind of flesh that out a little bit and maybe give us an idea of the magnitude of the benefit that you see potentially materializing as a result of the rwa actions and then lastly is other business or portfolio sales or divestitures considered within that thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp the second part of the question was andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp are other business sales considered terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp oh business sales yeah at least at this particular point in time obviously well look at a lot of different things in terms of businesses that we may look at to sell i mean that portfolio optimization is something were always doing and weve done that a number of different times over the last several years so that obviously will be something well look at but we have a sizeable mortgage servicing rights portfolio well take a look at selling portions of that where that makes sense well look at asset securitization like we did in the fourth quarter there are a whole variety of risk transfer sort of structures that both we have put into place and we already have on the shelf and were ready to kind of start moving forward on when we can so i think its a whole variety of different things that we will take a look at as well as balancing the mix toward growth in what i would say less capitalintensive businesses as opposed to capitalintensive businesses so its a itll be a whole combination of things as we move forward john john pancari q analyst evercore isi and do you have a way to help us estimate the magnitude in terms of how youre thinking about that targeted contribution from the rwa optimization strategies andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so the strategies that we have in place are reflected in the guidance that we provided so that would not change that and we will continue to update that guidance with given the economic conditions and rates and the scenarios that we see but as terry mentioned this is a priority for us and we have a number of initiatives underway which is the appropriate thing to do because i think capital for all banks is going to be more precious as we think about the forward regulatory environment john pancari q analyst evercore isi us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 got it and then just one more for me and i know you mentioned in terms of other regulatory changes potentially coming down the pike youre already in the advanced phase of proposed rulemaking on the tlac thing could you just talk about the other potential regulatory changes you see coming down the pike i know you had mentioned the aoci efforts but can you talk about potentially around fdic or stress capital buffer liquidity rules anything on that front worth commenting on terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean it could be a number of different things i mean we talked about tlac i mean just levels of capital you hear them talking about domestically significantly important banks so increasing the level of the stress capital buffer is another piece of it i think another one will be around lcr and then in the ccar process i think that theyll incorporate i would say multiple but kind of go back to what they used to do theyll have kind of multiple scenarios but one will be kind of what i would say a traditional sort of stress test where unemployment goes up and rates come down another one will be more i think some form of stagflation where rates stay relatively high and you experience the credit loss stress and again weve run a variety of different scenarios and i think we feel like we would be able to withstand either one of those just based upon our risk profile john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks terry operator next we can go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey gerard good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning terry good morning andy i have a narrower question i think it was on slide you guys talked about the impacts of deposits following march the inflows that you referenced did that come primarily in the union bank franchise because obviously it was located in california i know you guys havent been in california as well and then second was it more commercial versus consumer and more interestbearing versus noninterestbearing terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah maybe in terms of the mix so right after march we actually saw a lot of account customer opening more so on the commercial corporate side i would say probably on that side as opposed to on the consumer side of the equation we saw inflows but again that ended up getting offset by kind of seasonal flows within corporate trust as the rest of the month kind of progressed us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 the other thing that i would say is that when i look at deposit net new customer accounts in specifically in california on the consumer side we actually saw a nice increase or pop in march relative to previous months so i think that were actually probably seeing some benefits associated with that and i think that addresses the questions that you had gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and then over the years you guys have always done quite well in underwriting your loan portfolio you show up well in the ccar tests over the years on credit and so you dont have a very big exposure to commercial real estate and i always find it interesting to talk to banks that dont have big exposures to a potential credit area that could be a problem what are you guys seeing in that commercial real estate area particularly in the office portfolio any color would be helpful andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure gerard so first of all the rest of the portfolio is very stable if you look at our chargeoff rates on non accruals and so forth and the numbers around credit metrics the rest of the portfolio is stable and starting to normalize but normalizing as we expected i do think the area of focus for all of us is office within real estate and i do think theres some activity occurring there with tenants behavior changes sponsor behavior changes that is going to cause some pressure in the industry because of maybe an acceleration of what we thought was going to be a little longer process occurring more rapidly so you can imagine that were very focused on it as well we have not put on a lot of cre office over the last many years weve been very very conservative around that so as you say we dont have a large exposure but i do think its an area of a lot of emphasis and focus because i do think there are going to be pressures occurring gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator next we can go to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ebrahim andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i had a followup question i think you briefly mentioned about i think aoci hedges against if rates spike i was wondering terry if you can elaborate on that weve seen the fiveyear come back again in the last few weeks just whats the downside risk to capital or just an increase in aoci if rates spiked another basis points and just talk to us in terms of the extent to which you expect to hedge against that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so again weve been taking a number of different actions in order to kind of dampen the effect as i said selling securities where appropriate shortening the duration which we did very nicely i guess in the first quarter and then putting in place payfixed swaps against the long end of the curve so dampening the effect of a movement up of rates in both for example in the and 10year sort of space we if rates moved up basis points obviously aoci would be impacted to some extent but weve dampened that quite a bit over the course of the last couple of quarters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just going back to deposit betas i think you talked about relative to this quarter i mean im sure you do youll do a ton of analysis on where ph terminal betas might end up but whats the downside risk we obviously had a shock to the system fed funds being plus whats the risk how do you handicap the risk of that beta actually turning out to be something much higher maybe closer to terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah weve done a lot of different analysis and i mean you are right the competition for deposits is getting stronger weve kind of taken into that consideration were seeing over in some markets generally it is smaller banks where that is occurring community markets those sorts of things and thats because for those entities thats their primary source of funding and so thats going to occur but all of that has been kind of taken into consideration in terms of looking at that deposit beta if you end up looking at our business again in terms of who we end up competing against et cetera but what we end up looking at and tracking is especially on the institutional corporate side of the equation is money market rates and those sorts of and those sorts of things right now thats kind of in the high and our deposit pricing is very competitive with that which is why it gives us confidence with respect to both flows and the deposit betas that weve articulated ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and you dont see a major shift in consumer and retail deposit pricing today versus maybe at the start of the year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 yeah its going to depend i mean obviously this depends upon the rate environment i mean if the fed for example goes up another basis points or basis points from here that would put more pressure on deposit betas but if you end up looking at the market implied or even up a bit i still feel pretty comfortable with where were at ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator and next we can go to matt oconnor with indiscernible bank please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc its deutsche bank youve got very strong reserves to loans on a stated basis i guess first can you remind us what the impact there is if you adjusted for the union bank loans that were marked at fair value when you took them on if you have that handy terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i missed the first part of the question andy did you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think matt youre trying to understand if union bank has an impact on our reservetoloans ratio and what it is i dont think it has a major impact terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp not a significant one matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just broadly speaking like as you think about the rest of the year i mean youre obviously taking your best guess on reserves at the current indiscernible a hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 your thoughts on yeah a sorry its hard to hear you matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc sorry can you hear me better now terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thats better thank you matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay sorry about that i was just asking about the outlook for the loan loss reserves from here in your base case terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so our expectation is that again andys talked about the fact that were preparing for any economic sort of outcome that might exist i think if you end up looking at the consensus in the marketplace some form of recession probably a softer or moderate sort of recession late this year or early next year and if you look at the market implieds that would kind of tie into that when we go through our reserving process we look at multiple scenarios we weight to the conservative side we look at five different scenarios we make assumptions with respect to that only of its weighted toward what i would call the base case and the rest of it is downside so we feel pretty good about where rate reserve levels are obviously if we saw an economic shock above and beyond kind of what is being expected that might be a little bit different but and we feel pretty good about how were thinking about it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then maybe if i could just squeeze in on spending trends throughout regards to your payments business obviously we see a lot just any observations on kind of trends throughout the quarter and maybe any comments so far in april thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah in our payments business we continuing to see pretty strong sales 10pluspercent for example in our payments merchant processing business a very strong mid to highsingle digits with respect to our corporate payments business if you end up comparing any of these things to prepandemic its through the roof so we continue to see a good spend in the business us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 i would say that after the market disruption there was a bit more softness in retail sales which were going to continue to watch its really too early to tell whether or not thats a trend or whether that was really some of the concerns around the market disruption but well continue to watch that andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah and that is still growing matt but its just growing at a lower rate particularly in retail airline spend continues to be very very high which is a little bit of a reason that we have a differential between a sales growth and revenue growth because the airline spread is a little thinner so travel continues to be strong retail came down a bit but still growing matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thank you everyone andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator next we can go to chris kotowski with oppenheimer company please go ahead chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc broker yeah good morning terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning chris chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc broker good morning thanks for taking my question youve given us a lot of good detail on the afs side i just wonder if you could discuss a little bit how you anticipate managing the heldtomaturity portfolio do you also plan to let that kind of burn down and shorten and im curious just given that thats a lot of mortgagebacked and as there are principal payments each month how quickly does that portfolio burn down or do you see the need to maintain a lot of duration there just in case we get another decline in rates terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean obviously we look at both sides of the equation the burndown on the htm side is simply because of the nature of it it is really more tied to how quickly you see payouts and what the duration of that ends up looking at i think as we look at the size of the investment portfolio et cetera well take into consideration what level of duration we want to have in that in the htm portfolio but thats going to be more a function of just paydowns and payoffs over time us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc broker yeah but i mean just i guess the question directionally in the next couple of quarters theres youd probably let the duration shorten and the size of the portfolio burn down left to your own devices terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah yeah chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc broker yeah terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp absolutely yeah chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc broker okay all righty thats it for me thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks chris terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks chris operator next we have ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning first question i just wanted to ask you on credit on an adjusted basis your charge offs were basis points this quarter and per the comments you made earlier about cre and some of the data we see in the release about delinquencies and npas increasing whats your just whats your outlook for chargeoffs as we go forward versus the basis points that we saw in the first terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean our expectation is that basis will continue to normalize throughout the year and into probably on a similar sort of pace i think is basis points in the fourth quarter so i think that that will continue to kind of move up as the year progresses just a part of normalization us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood on that okay and then just coming back to the full year guide obviously you made a modest adjustment which was well expected given the change in the rate outlook we can back into that i think its mostly on the nii side just given that thats where seemingly some of the changes were versus the prior outlook but can you just kind of refresh us and just give us kind of just some underlying thoughts of nii growth versus fee growth and any changes you had on if any on the fee side versus your prior outlook thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp to your point most of the changes were in nii and its a function of the of rate curve the rate environment the expectation about rate increases as well as the deposit pricing that terry made reference to in the beta approaching so most of the change was in nii ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then so just last followup so then embedded in your fee outlook for the year it was pretty decent growth it would seem then and are you expecting that to still be mostly driven by the payments business or are there other areas that youre expecting to see some good growth in andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp we have a great diversity of revenue sources and theyre all doing well so payments is up approaching doubledigits on a yearoveryear basis as terry talked about spend levels are good we had a bang of a quarter in our commercial products group across the categories and that is doing just terrifically in this environment and just driving revenue growth as well trust is doing well so and mortgage so thats the value of a diverse revenue stream there are many different sources of revenue and fee income ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it understood thanks guys terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thank you operator next we can go to vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi vivek us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi andy hi terry a couple just a clarifications i think you all mentioned that accretion from the deal andy is going better than you had expected any i know youve talked a lot just trying to pull this all together where are you seeing it better thus far andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah so and we talked about this vivek in the fourth quarter that the expectation of that going to and the returns actually better so if i look at it in the big picture when we initially thought about the deal union bank had a billion or so revenue base and a or so billion billion expense base so ph million ppnr and you look at the first quarter and its double that so the revenues are stronger principally because of the value of deposits in this rate environment the expenses are a little less and our expectations on our efficiencies are continuing to be on plan so all that adds up to a higher accretion vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp and that higher accretion is the net purchase accounting is actually negative given the vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp core deposit intangible so its very strong vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right and thats before you even finish the integration that youve i mean thats not till second quarter anyway andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thats right andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 thats correct vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thank you operator next we can go to erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yeah sorry to prolong the call i just had one followup question andy i asked the question in a compound way so i apologize but as you think about accreting to over cet1 by year end how would you stack rank dividend growth as a priority andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp dividend growth continues to be a priority erika so our expectation is we would have continued growth in the dividend the dividend growth number is not hugely material to the capital accretion math if you go through the numbers on that that is a relatively small component of a negative downturn in capital so i that expectation that i talked about includes the expectation of a strong dividend erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator and next well go to mike mayo with wells fargo securities andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi hey last quarter you mentioned your reserves were for an environment with unemployment i was wondering if you had an update for that and given cecl accounting does that mean your reserving is done before the recession has even started or how do you think about that and what about the release of reserves to the extent you stay down in the low chargeoff range even with some of the normalization andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 yeah well i think well wait and see what ends up happening given the uncertainty thats in the economy regarding the last bit of it but yeah no we had said that it was the weighted average at the peak was on peak quarter was about a little over its about today is kind of what our weighted average case kind of comes up to so very similar to what we had before mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and your outlook for the economy soft recession hard landing kind of whats your thinking andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so mike we expect a soft recession a moderate recession in the later half of this year but as terry mentioned our cecl accounting is assuming a sort of a twothirds downturn onethird base case so we are reserved to a little bit more downward scenario mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator and we have no further questions at this time i will now turn it back to george andersen please continue george andersen directorinvestor relations us bancorp thank you for listening to our
