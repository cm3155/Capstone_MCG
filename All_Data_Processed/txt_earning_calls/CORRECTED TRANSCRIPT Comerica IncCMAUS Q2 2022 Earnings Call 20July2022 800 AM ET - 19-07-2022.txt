earnings of million or per share an increase of over the first quarter pretax pre provision net revenue was up and our roe increased to these results reflect the rising rate environment including prudent actions we have taken to lock in higher rates in addition we produced strong loan growth and generated a solid increase in fee income while the overall economic environment is uncertain overall our customers are generally optimistic about the future and while they may be seeing some pressure on their margins they remain in good shape as i discussed on our last earnings call we kicked off several initiatives related to modernization as we continue to evolve and adapt to meet the changing landscape and move into a new era of banking we believe that our brand identity should also reflect this change therefore we recently unveiled a refreshed corporate logo that represents our commitment to both our 173year legacy and our vision for the future also last month we announced actions taken as part of our retail bank transformation which included adding small business bankers in strategic locations updating our web and mobile banking platforms and expanding our interactive teller machine network in addition we are consolidating or of our banking centers which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter we have continued to work on other initiatives around optimizing our facilities the goal is to comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 better accommodate flexible work arrangements that reduce our footprint while maximizing locations that best serve our customers in addition as we progress on our cloud journey and decommissioned data centers our technology facilities are being consolidated we are excited about the progress we have made and the path we are laying for our future as far as our progress in the esg area i encourage you to review our 14th annual corporate responsibility related report which was recently published in the second quarter our green loans and commitments continued to grow and totaled billion at quarter end once again our commitment to corporate responsibility has been recognized with honors from the national diversity council as one of the most communityminded companies in the us also we appointed our national hispanic business development manager to further support our commitment to strengthening relationships with hispanic business leaders entrepreneurs and communities and finally weve established a renewable energy solutions group turning now to highlights of our second quarter results outlined on slide second quarter loan growth was one of the highest in our history with increases in nearly every business line the biggest drivers were general middle market large corporate equity fund services as well as modest growth in national dealer services in general customers are rebuilding inventory levels which has resulted in increasing working capital needs while capex spending remains relatively slow we are strategically managing deposits and customers are putting their excess liquidity to work which resulted in a decline net interest income benefited from higher rates as well as growth of our loan and hedging portfolios credit quality remained excellent and fee income increased led by syndication derivative and warrant activities expenses were driven by investments we were making to support growth and performancerelated compensation higher revenue combined with solid expense management resulted in significant improvement in our efficiency ratio to overall a strong quarter and we feel positive about the path we are on as we move through the remainder of the year and now well turn the call over to jim who will review the quarter in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide as curt just mentioned loan growth was very robust increasing billion driven by favorable environmental factors as well as our relationship focused approach as of quarter end loan commitments were up billion or and the line utilization rate held steady at about national dealer services loans increased over million this included a million increase in floor plan loans to million however these balances remained well below our typical run rate of about billion we expect it will take some time for inventory levels to rebuild as supply issues are resolved and pentup demand is satisfied general middle market average loans were up over and large corporate grew borrowing needs are being driven by higher material prices and inventory levels as well as ma and to a lesser extent capex we continue to have great success in our equity fund services business where we provide capital call and subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms of note mortgage banker increased about million while home sales were seasonally higher volumes remained depressed due to higher rates lack of housing inventory and shorter dwell times we expect third quarter mortgage banker loans to be stable commercial real estate loans decreased however production remained strong and loan commitments were up we expect moderate loan growth in commercial real estate as comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 projects fund through the year loan yields increased basis points primarily reflecting the benefit from higher rates as shown on slide on a yearoveryear basis average deposits were up billion relative to the first quarter deposits declined as customers continued to put their excess liquidity to work and we prudently managed pricing as it relates to nonrelationship based deposits in highly rate sensitive segments approximately half of the decrease occurred in our municipalities and financial institutions businesses which fall under general middle market notably retail and wealth management deposits increased the average cost of our interest bearing deposits remained at an alltime low of basis points we continue to monetize our asset sensitivity as rates increased by growing our securities portfolio average balances increased billion as shown on slide during the second quarter we purchased billion in mbs with average yields of basis points and we had repayments of million as we continue to execute our balance sheet hedging strategy we will likely pivot towards swaps given the relative size of our securities book and the desire to maintain adequate cash to fund loan growth the larger portfolio along with the favorable new purchase yields resulted in a million increase in securities income holding balances and rates steady at june levels third quarter securities revenue would increase about million the rise in rates resulted in a marktomarket impact on our securities portfolio of million which runs through oci and affects our book value but not our regulatory capital ratios while we maintain the portfolio as available for sale mostly for liquidity purposes we typically hold these securities to maturity in which case the unrealized losses should be recouped net interest income increased million and the net interest margin increased basis points the benefit from higher rates lifted loan income million and added basis points to the margin loan growth added million and basis points one additional day in the quarter provided million and as i mentioned the increase in the size of our securities portfolio at higher yields added million higher rates on deposits at the fed added million which was partly offset by lower balances and together added basis points to the margin higher rates on our floating rate wholesale debt had a million impact all together the rise in rates provided a net benefit of million in net interest income credit quality remained excellent as outlined on slide including no net chargeoffs criticized loans decreased to a record low level and nonaccrual loans declined as well overall our customers have continued to perform well and they maintain strong balance sheets despite supply chain issues labor constraints and inflationary challenges strong credit metrics loan growth and a somewhat weaker economic forecast resulted in a relatively stable allowance for credit losses at of loans and a provision of only million as always we are closely monitoring the portfolio for signs of stress nevertheless with our consistent disciplined approach to credit as well as our relationshipbased diverse portfolio we believe we are well positioned to manage through a recessionary environment noninterest income increased million or as outlined on slide syndication activity was strong and increased from a seasonally low first quarter resulting in an million increase in commercial lending fees warrantrelated income also increased million derivative income increased million including million of favorable credit valuation adjustments along with increased interest rate derivative activity comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 fiduciary income increased million mainly due to annual taxrelated fees deposit service charges increased with a pickup in activity relative to a slow first quarter finally deferred comp which was offset in expenses decreased million to a total negative return of million for the quarter of note relative to the second quarter last year deferred comp decreased million and card fees declined million due to last years stimulus related activity turning to expenses on slide our efficiency ratio improved percentage points to as we continue to maintain our expense discipline as revenue generation accelerates and we position for future growth salaries and benefits increased million with a number of moving pieces performancebased incentives tied to our strong financial results increased million annual merit higher staff insurance and technologyrelated contract labor each added million this was partly offset by the resetting of annual stock comp and payroll taxes which impacted the first quarter finally as i mentioned on the previous slide deferred comp asset returns decreased million of note our staff levels were stable as we are successfully retaining and attracting talent in a very competitive market certain technology related costs such as software equipment and consulting increased million litigation related legal costs were higher and the increase in occupancy includes our branch consolidation activity operational losses decreased from the elevated first quarter level and we received a million state tax refund we are experiencing some inflationary pressure particularly in salaries travel and entertainment and insurance by leveraging technology investments to increase productivity we have been working hard to offset this headwind as curt described we continue to make progress on certain modernization initiatives which totaled million in the second quarter this is a journey which includes transformation of our retail banking delivery model alignment of corporate facilities and technology optimization the cost savings generated are expected to be reinvested as we continue to evolve slide provides details on capital management loans and securities portfolio growth resulted in a decrease in our cet1 ratio to an estimated we continue to closely monitor loan trends and we expect to move closer to the targeted cet1 ratio over the nearterm through capital generated from strong earnings retention as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to shareholders our common equity declined in the second quarter as a result of the impact of oci losses from our securities and swap portfolios excluding the oci losses our common equity per share increased to slide provides an update on our interest rate sensitivity the bulk of our loans are floating rate and the majority of our deposits are noninterestbearing therefore as demonstrated in the second quarter our balance sheet reacts very quickly to changes in interest rates in order to provide a more sustainable earnings stream through the rate cycles we have been adding hedges to lock in market expectations for future shortterm rates while importantly reducing the downside impact of a potential decline in short rates over time to provide an outlook for net interest income we use the forward curve as of june 30th as well as expectations for loan and deposit activity for the remainder of the year a slightly steeper curve and added hedges have provided incremental revenue relative to the previous outlook we now expect net interest income to increase by approximately relative to an increase about in the third quarter relative to second quarter of course there are many dynamics that may cause results to differ specifically the pace of changes in shortterm rates deposit betas and loan activity comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 our outlook for is on slide and assumes a continuation of the current economic environment given the robust broadbased loan growth weve generated so far this year we are increasing our expectation for average loans to grow to yearoveryear excluding ppp loans relative to the second quarter we expect average loans to grow to per quarter in the first half of the year in certain areas like middle market for example we saw increased utilization as customers work to rebuild their inventory in the second half of the year we expect that trend to stabilize consistent with customers increased borrowing needs we expect they will continue to draw down deposits also the impact of the feds tightening is expected to be partly offset by our typical fourth quarter seasonality as far as rates we are closely monitoring the environment and staying close to our customers we expect increased deposit rates in the second half of the year and start moving towards our historical beta as interest rates continue to increase net interest income expectations were reviewed on the previous slide credit quality is expected to remain strong assuming the macroeconomic challenges continue to remain manageable we expect criticized and nonaccrual loans to remain low and net chargeoffs could begin the trend to the lower end of our normal range of basis points to basis points we believe our reserves are appropriate for the current and expected environment noninterest income is expected to decline to on a yearoveryear basis recall that was the highest on record and included elevated levels of warrants derivatives stimulusrelated card fees and deferred compensation we expect third and fourth quarter levels to be consistent with the second quarter following strong activity in the second quarter we expect some pressure on commercial lending fees derivatives and fiduciary this may be offset by deferred comp which is difficult to predict therefore we assume will not repeat we expect expenses to increase to yearoveryear excluding any notable expenses related to our modernization program this yearoveryear increase is primarily due to higher performancebased compensation annual merit technology investments and inflationary pressures relative to the first half of the year the second half is expected to increase to excluding modernizationrelated expenses the increase is driven by annual merit higher staff insurance advertising business investment and outside processing expense partly offset by lower performancebased comp and deferred comp excluding the million benefit from deferred comp in the first half which is not expected to repeat expenses are expected to be up to in the second half of the year we expect the tax rate to be to excluding discrete items and finally as i indicated on the previous slide we are focused on our cet1 target of as we monitor loan growth trends in summary our outlook for the full year has improved with the benefit of higher rates including the execution of our hedging strategy more robust loan and fee income generation partly offset by higher expenses in conjunction with growing revenue and our strong financial performance now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim many business lines continue to show good momentum with very strong loan growth and increases in commitments in our pipeline our unique expertise in many areas as well as our geographic footprint offers significant opportunities credit quality remains excellent a testament to our strong credit culture our expense discipline was evident as we continue to invest to provide a high caliber customer and colleague experience our balance sheet structure has quickly produced benefits from rising rates and we expect to comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 continue to appropriately add hedges with the goal of providing a more consistent earnings performance through the cycles it was a strong quarter and im very grateful for the dedication of my colleagues who work hard every day to ensure comericas success we believe we are well positioned to continue to produce strong results as we move through the remainder of the year thank you for your time and now wed be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey thank you indiscernible question just wanted to discuss the nii trajectory a bit so i think the guide sort of parsing between the full year and the third quarter would imply it reach a fourth quarter nii of about million or so so is that a sustainable level and i guess more broadly the question is can you just sort of describe in laymans terms how your nii will react once it reaches its peak and what exactly happens to the margin this time around when rates either stabilize at a higher level or begin to come back down james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc great scott good morning thanks for the question yeah your math is correct it would imply assuming the june 30th forward curve holds say fourth quarter net interest income of million i think thats a pretty good jumping off point for of course were not offering guidance at this time but there are some puts and takes there we do not realize the full impact of the december and november hikes in the fourth quarter on the other hand deposit betas do lag and you could see some upward pressure there once we get beyond the fourth quarter and so with that said i think its a pretty good jumping off point in the fourth quarter of course well have loan volume increases and other balance sheet movement but it does position us very well for in terms of how we react to interest rate changes our goal all along has been to reduce the asset sensitivity to the point where we can produce a very high level of net interest income and i will note that million if the forward curve is realized is by far and away the highest net interest income weve ever earned for a quarter so i think we will have achieved our goal we left enough asset sensitivity to achieve record levels yet at the same time were protecting that net interest income and to answer your question more directly our goal once we enter is to have our asset sensitivity to the downside at a low singledigit percentage so that would imply that if shortterm rates do drop we should be largely protected now over time you will have swap securities roll off and rolling back on so there will be a little bit of up or down depending on what happens to the long end of the curve but we think were very well positioned for comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect thank you and then just wanted to ask on deposit costs the basis points of deposit cost is just terrific you noted betas will start to ramp up in the second half here just curious sort of broadly how you balance pressures on costs with a desire to ultimately hold certain balances james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah scott we are paying very close attention to deposit costs were staying extremely close to our customers those conversations are going on daily we will clearly see those costs rise in the second half of the year there is a little bit of a lag typically between when those discussions happen and when theyre fully realized so ive heard in some other earnings calls in terms of when the real pivot point is and frankly i dont think you can ever point to any one fed hike when these hikes are so close to each other but we will certainly start seeing us move towards not just our standard betas in the third quarter but by the end of the year well probably be approaching our standard beta for the accumulated standard beta that we publish also but those conversations will go on and ill just stress that its a very relationship based model here so its based on the forward relationship with the customer its based on those conversations and we feel like were in very good communication with the customers and feel good about our positioning there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you guys very much james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 can you help us understand what youre seeing and hearing from borrowers in terms of the economic outlook were all on recession watch and i guess id love to hear your views and maybe for you melinda can you just touch on what kind of an economic outlook your reserve level reflects peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc jon this this peter ill go first on customers and then melinda you can talk about the economic outlook but i think recession watch that you used there thats not unique to you or all of us our customers are probably in the same boat that said i think that they are doing really well our pipeline is strong our activity levels are good so its hard to see sort of immediate concerns i think a lot of their concerns that we hear are a lot or further out they dont feel like concerns but obviously inflation interest rates all the things that were dealing with but the outlook we said generally optimistic we still feel that way were encouraged about what were seeing it does depend a little bit on geography and it does depend a little bit on line of business but overall we feel like our sentiment of our customers is still pretty good at this time melinda do you want to comment on indiscernible melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah jon thanks for the question so as you know we use a variety of thirdparty forecasts and the q2 economic forecast although it was still positive did show some deterioration from the first quarter with weaker growth higher likelihood of recession and a much higher degree of uncertainty so our baseline forecast i would say was slightly worse than our q1 forecast we also use a severe recessionary scenario ph of the stress certain parts of our portfolio and this is really used to inform the qualitative component and those qualitatives continue to comprise a meaningful component of the total reserve so we feel really good about our reserve levels at this point we believe that they are appropriately conservative for the economic environment including kind of the nearterm uncertainty jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so general message on provision would be growth plus chargeoffs and thats generally adequate in your view at this point melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah assuming the economic forecast remains sort of stable and the portfolio metrics dont change to the downside the reserve build will tend to tie pretty closely to loan growth and then obviously if the economic forecast worsens then well see reserve builds but as you know this is a complex process that we go through each quarter and it would be pretty impossible to guesstimate what that would actually be jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you thats very helpful comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc welcome peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc thanks jon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone so first to drill down on deposits historically speaking companies drawing down on deposits to fund business investment was a good thing but we also have companies now drawing down to earn a higher yield curious when you guys look at the billion of noninterestbearing how much of that do you see that could be a risk of outflows james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc hey steve good morning if you look at where we were prepandemic our mix of noninterestbearing deposits was just under i think it was to you see that were closer to this quarter i think that might be a good proxy for where we could end up if rates go up to where the forward curve is predicting right now so its going to be a little bit dependent on eca rates and other levers we pull to either keep customers on or off the balance sheet but i think that would be a pretty good proxy steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah steve i might add this is peter i mean a lot of our deposits that are going to be ratedriven are going to be in our bigger businesses you might say so call it us banking or business deposit services businesses where theyre moving higher deposits but we have relationships but its not we dont have like all the treasury managers we dont have all the relationships so theyre deposits that are going to move for rate but we can negotiate that if we need to we can be more aggressive if we need to but i mean we feel like we can have conversations and handle that appropriately steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 okay actually to follow up on that so if we think through this the fed actions are going to have an outsized impact on deposit markets how do you see that playing out into the business and do you think that you might continue to see deposit runoff in could this just continue through next year james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc i think we will see the bulk of it likely in that fourth quarter of to first quarter of range at least thats our forecast right now predicting deposits is always a little bit challenging not just pricing can lag a little bit but sometimes customer reaction can lag a little bit too having said that these outsized changes by the fed do put the antenna up on some customers so maybe we wont see quite the same lag weve seen in the past but i do think its kind of in that crossover range of fourth quarter to first quarter but having said that youll recall earlier from my opening comments we usually get seasonality in the fourth quarter so it may not be apparent when you see the fourth quarter results it would probably manifest more in the first quarter but i would expect most of that to shake out by the first quarter of steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful if i could squeeze one more in going back to jons question on customer sentiment when i look at line utilization not line utilization but commitments increasing it could be a sign that customers are more optimistic or it could mean a sign that theyre more cautious on recession coming are you guys really convinced that what youre seeing is because of optimism in their business and not just companies historically want to get more credit before a recession comes thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc steve again its peter yeah i would say that that is true we dont really see this as defensive ask or recession concerns certainly nothing like what we saw when the pandemic started and we saw tremendous asks for recession lines of credit insurance thats not what were seeing right now were seeing business reason asks for all those things that jim and curt outlined of working capital needs everything costs more money theres good ma opportunities for some of these companies so no its all pretty legitimate business needs and at this time it doesnt appear to be or were not seeing indications of it being recession preparation sort of asks steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color i appreciate it peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 good morning ebrahim ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess just one jim to follow up on scotts initial question around nii and just want to make sure we understand your comments correctly in a world where the fed stops hiking by the end of the year potentially gets to cutting interest rates at some point in do you expect nii in that backdrop to stabilize compared to and im looking back to when nii peaked the same quarter when the fed stopped hiking im just trying to make sure the impact of your swaps essentially implies that that million plus kind of nii will still hold for the foreseeable future until some of these swaps roll off which is in the out years james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yes ebrahim we feel we are much much better positioned if rates were to drop in than we were in we were somewhat exposed there and had not finished the hedging program we feel much better about holding on to the higher levels of net interest income this time around and as i mentioned the goal by the end of the year is to get down to the singledigit percent of net interest income at risk for a gradual 100bp hike or bps on average so we should hold on to most of that income as we move to curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim ph id just add with some puts and takes around where deposit betas might go and what loan growth does in james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thats right yeah certainly some ins and outs there as i mentioned the full impact of november december hikes isnt factored into that fourth quarter guidance loan volume ph is not factored in but deposit betas made leg into the year so you definitely see moving parts go in different directions but i mean the whole goal all along ebrahim as you know and youve heard us say is to protect ourselves better protect ourselves from a drop in rate so thats what weve been working on and were largely successful up to this point and we plan on being done with the overall program by the end of the year ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch sure and im sorry if i missed this did you mention jim whats the deposit beta youre assuming by the end of the year james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc well we typically think about a standard beta i do think that we will through the third quarter be approaching that with hikes and probably go a little past it for individual hikes by the end of the year i dont know that the accumulated standard beta will be fully reflected in the fourth quarter results just because of the lag and the full quarter effect i mean it could be but at this point i think its more likely to be early the first quarter of but well see how market forces react and respond and how we work with our customers comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and if i could one on the lending side i think you mentioned dealer finance close to million versus billion prepandemic i mean one im assuming inventory build for cars will help that but do you think that business may have structurally changed where we never get to that billion i would love to hear your thoughts in terms of what youre hearing from your clients and second i think the other thing that you mentioned i think curt was youre not seeing a high degree of capex spend driving demand just give us a sense of whats holding back customers around capex we heard some of your peers talk about actually capex contributing to growth so would loan any perspective on both those peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc ebrahim its peter so on dealer the question you asked was about whether or not well ever get back to the billion levels and thats a question the industry in general is dealing with what do days inventory look like on the other side of this cycle that were in and i dont know that theres a clear answer to it as of right now we still see really low inventory levels on dealer lots our floor plan usage is still really really low compared to historical levels and whether it gets back to the billion is to be determined we believe and i think when you talk to a lot of customers that its probably somewhere in the middle i dont think youre going to see days of inventory but i dont think youre going to see days either its probably to but at the same time different oems are communicating different things to the dealers and so well just kind of see what that looks like on a go forward basis as far as the capex i dont want to suggest to you that theres no capex going on i think that most of our customer base though is being as we have said recession watch making sure that they dont do something that stretches themselves too much so we are seeing a little bit of capex but its not probably the main driver of the borrowings that we have mentioned so you do see some of it i think that its all been very prudent and we make sure to talk to our customers about what sort of investments theyre wanting to make and understand those and so far were seeing really good decisions ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks peter and thanks for taking my questions peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc hey good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning guys hey just on the cost side i know youre recalibrating in the second half versus the first and that deferred comp is a part of it but just wondering with the inflationary environment just can you comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 talk through the types of pressures youre seeing there built into that and then how you think about that translates as you look further ahead relative to the all the points that have been made about the nii strength in terms of operating leverage and how much of that incremental nii falls to the bottom line as we look further out james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc hey good morning ken thanks for the question yeah we are seeing some inflationary pressures were seeing it certainly on the salary side in terms of attraction and retention of talent we think were doing a really good job of calibrating that and hitting the right balance were seeing it a little bit as contracts renew theres a bit of a lag effect there so i think that will probably stick with us over the next year since contracts obviously dont renew on a frequent basis td were seeing it as i mentioned i think anyone thats even personally travelled have seen that insurance the insurance market has been hit a little bit hard thats probably for factors in addition to inflation but it is going to put some pressure i mentioned earlier this year that i thought overall on a full year basis it would perhaps add to the overall expense base and i think were probably looking at least probably about for the second half of the year alone in terms of pressure and well probably see that continue a little bit next year in terms of operating leverage thats always our goal to achieve positive operating leverage we obviously did it this quarter the goal is to do it going forward now that were stabilizing net interest income having said that were not prepared to offer guidance in yet but that is always the goal to generate positive operating leverage curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim i might just add from a bigger picture perspective i mean we are managing the business for the longterm and were taking advantage of the current rate environment to make sure that were appropriately balancing expenses versus revenue growth and trying to find ways to be relevant from a revenue perspective on a go forward basis so weve had eight consecutive quarters of doubledigit roe this quarter or efficiency ratio and so continuing to invest in technology and digital will be relevant there to our customers and to our colleagues weve made some geographic expansions into the southeast and as well as into the denver and for the mountain central region weve been adding some capacity in terms of rems and advisors in our commercial and wealth management business we talked about the new renewable energy group renewable energy solutions group so there are some things were doing to continue to add capacity as we sort of go forward and sort of take advantage of this higher rate environment but weve done a good job historically of managing expenses certainly if the environment changes we know how to manage expenses appropriately but sort of balancing the two is really important for us taking the longer term view ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it i appreciate that and just one followup question on the loan side almost all of the specialty businesses showed good direction and i think that might have been a little surprising especially in whats going on in dealer mortgage equity fund services can you just kind of flush out as you expect the loan growth to continue how do you expect some of those to act and are you seeing just better underlying trends in some of the supply constrain related areas thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah ken it was a great quarter with all of our businesses kind of moving in the right direction the only one that we didnt really see was commercial real estate but as we mentioned we booked a ton of business and we expect that to continue so the outlook for all of them continues to be pretty positive as i think weve said maybe not in the second half of the year what weve seen in the first half but it does feel positive i think mortgage bankers probably going to be flat to maybe down into the fourth quarter we havent seen the type of activity as everybody knows with interest rates housing inventory affordability i think that business will probably stay a little flat but the rest of the businesses have got really good pipelines really good outlooks and we feel good about it so it was nice for it to all be moving in the same direction this quarter and were encouraged that we would see that again this next quarter thank you ken operator thank you our next question will come from the line of christopher mcgratty with kbw please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hello chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning i want to start with just the earning asset aspect of the equation a lot of discussion on deposits can you help us with kind of targeted or minimum cash levels given the liquidity thats being removed from the system and also i think you touched upon in your prepared remarks back in office securities purchases i was trying to see trying to gauge what the asset levels will be for the next two quarters james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc hey chris good morning yeah historically we have always maintained probably a little larger cash buffer than perhaps other regional banks just because of our commercial banking model so typically we like to hold at least billion to billion in cash and if we have a little more than that it doesnt necessarily bother us obviously were starting to approach those levels we certainly have very strong and efficient borrowing channels whether it be broker deposits or fhlb line so to the extent we start getting down to those minimum cash levels they need to borrow thats not necessarily worrisome for us whatsoever its been contemplated and its really what weve been preparing for so we feel really good about how were managing that where earning assets go overall thats obviously going to be dependent on loan growth and where deposits go so theres a lot of ins and outs there were not necessarily forecasting earning asset levels themselves but we feel really comfortable with what were mapping out over the next couple years in terms of managing cash and being able to fund loan growth christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then if i could as a follow up to steves question about the dda reversion i guess mean reversion if im looking at the mix of deposits you said a couple of years ago it was high now its mid if you look at comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 the dollar difference its pretty meaningful so im just a little more interested in how do you get to your target call it mix is it growing others and shrinking or is it purely shrinking dda by multiples of billions thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc its going to be a combination we will see overall deposits of course go down and youll see some of that from both dda and interest bearing but at the same time you will see even for balances that stay on the balance sheet you will see for rate sensitive customers and where were price competitive you will see some of those ddas move to interest bearing so i feel like its a little bit of a mix in terms of how that mix changes itll be a combination of both overall dda leaving the balance sheet but also dda moving into interest bearing christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning just want to follow up on the loan front i think it was followup to kens question i know you gave your expectation on the components specifically around the mortgage warehouse ph let me get it stable to down can you maybe give us your thoughts on the other buckets specifically i believe you said modest growth you expect in commercial real estate but i want to confirm that and then maybe if you can talk about equity fund services outlook corporate banking and middle market thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah sure john its peter so i guess ill try to take those one at a time the equity fund services outlook is still pretty good theres been a lot about private equity funding fund formation and so forth our utilization was actually down in efs this quarter but our commitments grew our outstandings grew despite that and so were encouraged by what were seeing we feel like were a leader in that business and feel really good about the opportunities knowing that there is some challenges in the fundraising space but overall weve got a really good pipeline there our corporate business so us banking has had really good success that is probably on our customer sentiment i think larger companies with more geographic or international ph national exposure thats where our sentiment probably did drop a little bit more than the rest of our portfolio that said we did have a really good quarter and our activity level there continues to be really good within us banking weve got some comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 great specialty businesses around our gaming business around our sports franchise lending business and so the activity level there continues to be really really solid and then middle market in general you asked about is really encouraging in all of our geographies weve got a great activity level in texas michigan continues to be really strong california has come back from kind of where it was last year a little bit behind although we did see a little bit of drop in sentiment in california versus the other two markets but our activity level is still really really strong and then were starting to see really good opportunities out of southeast we have told you all that weve invested down there were hiring relationship managers and we feel really good about the opportunities that were starting to see there and then on commercial real estate john what i said there is we didnt see maybe as much outstanding loan growth in the second quarter but we did see a tremendous amount of commitment production we bank a lot of really great developers most of the business were doing there is with existing customers so its not like were reaching with new customers and the opportunities for those customers have been really really good and so we expect to see outstandings increase from here with commercial real estate just with the amount of activity that we have closed so far so i hope that gives you a little bit more john on each of the businesses that youre asking about john pancari q analyst evercore isi no that does thats helpful thank you and then my follow up is just around loan growth overall i know youre looking at to growth exppp for which is pretty solid and i know youre not formally out there with expectations but wanted to see if you could maybe help us think about the trajectory of that growth rate as you look at particularly with the expectation of potential economic slowing is it fair to assume a growth rate somewhere below that level or could you see it hold in that mid to high singledigit range peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc john its peter ill comment first and i dont know if jim wants to add but were going to continue to do everything we can to keep that growth rate as we have said above gdp were striving to do that in all of our markets and if you look at the outlook for texas and california and michigan those gdp outlooks are better than national averages so were going to continue to try to achieve that whether or not that looks like to in versus the overall economy i dont know but we do believe that our company can perform at a level better than what you might see on national gdp levels is how i would answer your question james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i think thats good i think we would be optimistic but a lot of its going to depend on the economy and how we move through john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities please go ahead comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning with the deposit growth slowed down significantly for the industry just wondering what comerica is doing in terms of tweaking its strategy there whether it be employee incentives related to deposit gathering or adding more small business bankers can you just give us some details on how youre thinking about that curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jennifer this is curt i might make a couple of comments and then turn first of all i mean perspective is really important here were at a loantodeposit ratio and we do not chase sort of transactional hot deposits everything we do is from a relationship based focus and so whether its in our commercial bank and our retail bank in our wealth management organization weve got the ability to flex up on pricing if we need to do that and sort of watching were going to do the right things from our customer perspective and then weve got access to plenty of other funding sources leveraging our securities portfolio fhlb et cetera and so on the list of things that im concerned about as ceo this is way down that list and you look at sort of where we were post pandemic we were in the plus range on loantodeposit perspective and so we still got plenty of funding to take care of our customers and appropriately grow the balance sheet and so were just trying to make sure were staying focused on the relationship side of this leveraging treasury management services and so maybe peter you want to talk about that peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah jennifer this is peter i was just going to add to curts comments that we are investing a lot and looking at our digital experience on the commercial side and making sure that were a leader in that space and making it as easy as we possibly can for our customers to interact with us digitally and providing all those products and services so thats where were leaning in on this issue when it comes to gathering deposits into the future particularly as you mentioned i think youll see more talk from us about the small business space which is a great deposit business but were focused on that investment as it relates to products and services i think the digital customer experience for commercial customers is one that we can lean into heavily and that we can lead in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah and i would just say along with digital deposits id love the emphasis were putting on treasury management investment and i love treasury management we love treasury management not just for the non interest income but the deposits that come with it so i would certainly lean on that as part of the mix also jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 thanks so much james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah good thanks jennifer operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning hey my questions were largely answered so i just thought id ask in terms of capital i dont believe you were active in the buyback this quarter with your cet1 under as you think about kind of building that back up over late this year or say early in if that comes to pass given the kind of uncertainty in terms of the economy and growth would you indiscernible maybe being more constrained on the buyback even in that scenario where youre back over over the next several quarters lets say james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah thanks gary we do think we will at least in our baseline forecast likely get back to by the end of the year i think we can accrete capital at to bps per quarter maybe closer to bps i think once we get there well do an assessment of where we stand where the economy is on one hand i am really excited about the fact that we will stabilize net interest income stabilize a lot of earnings that makes it a little easier to activate things like the share buyback on the other hand we are very aware of the volatility of cecl what that can do to capital ratios and we would certainly give that a fair amount of consideration as we start reaching and going above we would look at the credit environment and that would certainly weigh on how quickly we weigh back into a share repurchase program curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc certainly coupled with loan demand james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah loan demand and all the other variables of course also gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co sure thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve moss with b reilly securities please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc morning just following up on your asset sensitivity here you guys talked about next year wanting to be in the i guess singledigit range for downside to nii in the event of rate cut i just want to confirm i see on the deck that it looks like no more swaps are needed for the loan book or maybe how much more do you guys need to add to get to that level james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah thanks steve yeah i think we have on the slide that we will likely need up to billion of hedges to get to the low singledigit percents that is likely to be more of a swap strategy as opposed to a security strategy at this point given our cash levels but i will emphasize up to it is going to be dependent upon how the balance sheet shifts deposit levels will probably be the most important variable there so it could end up being far less than billion but i would just say up to billion and then it could be far less than billion depending on how the balance sheet shapes up steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great thank you very much james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you that was our last question in the queue ill now turn the call back over to president chairman and chief executive officer curt farmer for closing remarks curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc i just would say again it
