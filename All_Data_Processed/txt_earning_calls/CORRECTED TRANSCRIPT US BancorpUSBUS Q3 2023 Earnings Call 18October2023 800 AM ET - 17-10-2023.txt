thank you for joining our call ill begin on slide in the third quarter we reported earnings per share of which included per share of notable items related to merger and integration charges excluding those notable items we delivered earnings per share of for the quarter third quarter results were highlighted by linked quarter and yearoveryear fee revenue growth that benefited from our acquisition of union bank deepening client relationships and strong underlying business activity we are achieving the cost synergies we anticipated from union bank and continue to prudently manage core expense as we identify operational efficiencies across the business as of september our common equity tier capital ratio was an increase of basis points this quarter this is the same level it was prior to our acquisition of union bank total average deposits increased or billion on a linked quarter basis credit quality continues to normalize this quarter in line with expectations and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding million to our loan loss reserve reflective of an evolving credit environment on october the federal reserve granted us full relief from certain category ii commitments made in connection with the union bank acquisition given our balance sheet reduction and capital actions as a result we are now subject to existing capital rules or if adopted the same transition rules as all other category iii banks related to enhanced capital requirements under the basel iii end game proposal as proposed this would include a three year transition period for the expanded riskbased approach and aoci regulatory capital adjustments starting in the third quarter of i will discuss the impacts of this decisions further in my closing remarks slide provides income statement results as reported and on an adjusted basis ending and average balances and other key metrics slide provides key performance metrics excluding notable items our return on average assets was and our return on tangible common equity was while net interest margin declined basis points to this quarter in line with our expectations we continue to expect the nim to bottom in the fourth quarter as we reach the end of the current rate hiking cycle turning to slide a great benefit of our business model includes a balance between our spread and fee income businesses that helps us reduce earnings volatility through a business cycle on a yearoveryear basis noninterest income grew approximately within payment services we continue to invest in our digital capabilities expanding our payments ecosystem and optimizing our distribution emphasis on expanded partnerships and integrated capabilities will continue to support techled growth across merchant processing and increase opportunities across other areas of our payment services businesses additionally we are continuing to make investments that leverage our scale and strategic market positioning across our corporate trust mortgage banking and capital markets businesses which should enhance our already strong annualized growth trajectories slide highlights a few of our many postconversion revenue opportunities and expected cost synergies with union bank early indications of the potential of the deepened relationships with legacy union bank loyal affluent and diversified client base are promising and we continue to be on track to realize approximately million in cost synergies which we expect to be fully reflected in our run rate as we head into the year let me now turn the call over to john who will provide more details on the balance sheet and results for the quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 john c stern senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy turning to slide we ended the quarter with total average assets of billion and total average loans of billion down billion and billion respectively on a linked quarter basis as we prudently managed and optimized our balance sheet given the current macroeconomic and regulatory environment average total deposits were billion representing a increase linked quarter driven by expected seasonality and growth in money market and time deposit accounts specifically average noninterestbearing deposits decreased billion this quarter primarily driven by our union bank retail customer upgrade ph and conversion from noninterestbearing checking accounts to our interestbearing bank smartly product excluding this reclassification the decrease would have been billion our mix of noninterestbearing to interestbearing deposits was approximately consistent with where we expect the mix shift to stabilize based on historical performance and the operational nature of our core deposit base slide provides an update on the investment securities portfolio as of september our availableforsale securities were of our total securities we continue to reduce the effective duration of the afs portfolio which is now less than threeandhalf years on slide we provide a detailed earnings summary for the quarter this quarter we reported diluted earnings per share of or per share after adjusting for merger and integration charges of million net of tax or per diluted common share turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis totaled approximately billion which represented a decrease on a linked quarter basis and a increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates and the acquisition of union bank our net interest margin declined basis points to in the third quarter the linked quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of lower earning assets deposit pricing and mix shift offset somewhat by better loan spreads and funding mix slide highlights trends in noninterest income fee income increased or million on a yearoveryear basis driven by higher payment service revenue trust and investment management fees commercial products and mortgage banking revenues on a linked quarter basis fee income increased or million driven by other revenues which included servicing revenue from previously executed balance sheet optimization actions turning to slide reported noninterest expense for the quarter totaled billion which included million of merger and integrationrelated charges noninterest expense as adjusted decreased million or on a linked quarter basis driven by lower compensation expense that was somewhat offset by our investments in marketing and business development slide shows our credit quality performance this quarter while asset quality metrics reflecting changing conditions in the commercial real estate office segment results this quarter continue to trend in line with our expectations and key metrics remain below prepandemic levels importantly given the higher interest rate environment as well as other portfolio considerations we increased our reserve ratio for the commercial real estate office loans to our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at september compared with at june and a year ago our third quarter net chargeoff ratio of increased basis points from a second quarter level of as adjusted and was higher when compared to a third quarter of level of our allowance for credit losses as of september totaled billion or of periodend loans turning to slide we continued to take action to improve our capital ratios this quarter increasing our cet1 ratio to as of september the combination of our debttoequity conversion with mufg earnings accretion net of distributions and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a basis point increase from last quarter importantly our cet1 capital ratio is now basis points above our regulatory capital minimum i will now provide fourth quarter forward us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 looking guidance on slide in the fourth quarter we expect net interest income of between billion and billion total revenue as adjusted is estimated to be in the range of billion to billion including approximately million of purchase accounting accretion total noninterest expense as adjusted is expected to be approximately billion inclusive of approximately the million of core deposit intangible amortization related to union bank acquisition on a core basis we expect full year expenses to be flat with our income tax rate is expected to be approximately on a taxableequivalent basis we expect merger and integration charges of between million to million in the fourth quarter ill now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john turning to slide the federal reserve notified us on october that they have granted us full relief from category ii commitments made in conjunction with the union bank acquisition after considering several factors including actions to reduce our risk profile strengthen our capital position and provisions related to category iii rules made after we received approval on the union bank acquisition this important decision now subjects us to the same enhanced capital requirements as all other category iii banks including a threeyear phasein of aoci into regulatory capital starting in the third quarter of as expected we will continue to carefully balance the need to accrete capital with any potential impact to earnings from further balance sheet optimization activities measures to manage the interest rate sensitivity and duration of our availableforsale securities will continue since before our acquisition of union bank our priority has been and will continue to be the strategic execution of capitalefficient growth opportunities across each of our business lines as a result of the feds decision we are now well positioned with our enhanced earnings profile and diversified business mix to increase our capital levels continue our disciplined lending activities and further strengthen our balance sheet let me close by thanking our more than employees for their dedication to supporting the needs of our clients communities and shareholders well now open up the call to qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and we can go to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go head ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess maybe the first question just around the fed decision in its letter the fed said i guess the bank anticipated taking further actions to reduce risk profile and reduce assets and increase capital so if you dont mind talking about just what additional actions we should expect i think you mentioned that the eps impact would be neutral from here but just how should we think about what else the fed expects from you on the risk mitigation side as we move forward into next year thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure thanks ebrahim good morning this is john as a way of background the fed granted us as you mentioned full relief from our category ii commitments and thats because of the actions and andy mentioned this of our actions to reduce risk as well as our ability to strengthen our capital position so importantly this is going to provide us additional time and flexibility to meet those new regulatory requirements and do so in the same timeframe as our category iii peers and additionally we think its going to reduce the downside risk given the challenging rate environment but nothing really changes in terms of how were fundamentally managing the balance sheet going forward were still committed to building regulatory capital were still expecting to increase and accrete capital at a basis points to basis points on average per quarter and our expectation is to accelerate that as we get through the mergerrelated costs or be in the high end of that range i should say as we get through the mergerrelated costs and start to realize the full union bank synergies and were still going to be executing riskweighted asset optimization transactions but now we have the time and flexibility to do that over in a way that is low to neutral in terms of our earnings impact and so for all those reasons we feel like we have the flexibility in our balance sheet to do those sorts of things andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 i think thats exactly right john and the only thing id add is that part of this decision is reflective of what weve already done for the last months in terms of reducing the risk profile building capital optimizing the balance sheet and i want to be clear ebrahim we are not under an asset cap at all we are maintaining flexibility and managing the balance sheet and capital and well continue to remain focused on capitalefficient growth and that includes focusing in on highmargin highreturn businesses that exceed our cost of capital while deepening relationships with our most profitable clients and that has been and will continue to be our focus ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats good color thank you and just a separate question john i think i heard you correctly if i heard you correctly you mentioned you expect the nim to trough and im assuming nim ph equals nii to trough in the fourth quarter maybe indiscernible in terms of the steeper yield curve or widening in just the curve risk that assumption around troughing of nii or nim and what gives you confidence around mix shift consumer behavior to feel good about that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so i think in terms of the guidance we provided we have embedded in there our rate forecast which includes a rate increase in december whether or not that happens or not is relatively immaterial since were fairly neutral from an interest rate risk positioning standpoint i guess what i would say is as the fed is continue whether theyre done or not in terms of the rate hiking we start to see a lot of the things on the deposit side slow down so our noninterestbearing balances will be relatively stable here at this level the deposit betas will and rate paid will start to slow down and then on the other side your assets will start to reprice whether thats the securities book the loan book and all those sorts of things so thats what gives us the confidence really that we will bottom out here in the fourth quarter from a nim and net interest income perspective ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for taking my questions john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator next well go to john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning john john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 ph morning john john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning john could i just follow up on what you were just talking about what are you looking at in terms of the nim for the fourth quarter roughly and did i hear correctly you think the deposit mix kind of settles out around where you are here and beta kind of in the mid you still have those expectations john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah maybe just to go off the last couple questions you mentioned so from a noninterestbearing yes we do expect that mix right about thats about where we will be we expect that to be in that range and from a beta perspective we are in the mid right now its possible it could creep up higher depending on where the fed goes from here but we feel good about that and then in terms of the net interest margin and things like that we do anticipate a little bit more pressure here in the fourth quarter but then that really is the point where we feel itll bottom out based on my comments i just made to a previous question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and thats reflected in our revenue and net interest income guidance john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then recognizing with the fed decision youve obviously got a lot more time to phasein the aoci now john could you just give us a little more color on what happened in terms of the trend in aoci this quarter what are the pieces there and how do the swaps affect your burndown timeline and just also if you could add on how do you calculate the capital with aoci today looks like maybe around something like that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so i think allin its about aoci is about basis points of impact so i would say is probably roughly kind of where i would think about it in terms of the change in the afs obviously rates backed up on the long end of the curve to basis points depending on treasuries or mortgages that youre looking at and that had an impact of about billion in our on an aftertax basis on our afs securities book which we wouldve expected and is consistent with the duration of our book which we have continued to wind down as i mentioned in our comments about less than years is our current duration so thats the effect of that were continuing to see we will continue to see paydowns in that book whether its htm or afs we have about approximately billion or so per quarter that rolls off that book and will reinvest in the afs side of things over time john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john operator and next well go to mike mayo with wells fargo security sic wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just to be clear how much of the million merger savings were recognized in the third quarter results john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well in terms of we will get to a full run rate of million its probably million or so is kind of the in that range is probably what we were seeing but its been growing in terms of the amount and well see that full benefit ph fall through in the fourth quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so relative to the third quarter the first quarter of could see million of additional expense savings john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp no because weve been the savings have been generated all throughout the course of the year and they accelerate third quarter into fourth quarter second quarter third quarter into fourth quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so whats the cumulative merger savings i guess how much more expense savings should there be when theyre fully realized in the first quarter relative to the third quarter john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 when we have the savings well have approximately 400orso million that has gone through this full year and then well expect to see that in the next coming year but thats embedded into our full year guidance of flat expenses between and andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so mike the way i think about it this is andy by the end of the fourth quarter we will be on a run rate recognizing million of savings which will be fully reflected in in our expense base and that is consistent with how we think about a relatively flat to expense base including those savings plus investments well continue to make in the business mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then the big question then is so if you have flat expenses do you think you can get to positive operating leverage or is it too early or too many moving parts because this is the sweet spot of the merger savings coming up right by the next quarter andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp it is the sweet spot mike youre absolutely right and the savings are great the opportunities to deepen relationships on the union bank customer base i mentioned that in my comments i think that is terrific our fee businesses are doing extremely well on a yearoveryear basis it was up across almost every category and frankly very little of that was related to union bank that was just core improvement across a number of categories capital markets our corporate and trust our fee businesses our payments businesses the challenge for us and for the entire industry is net interest income and margin and in this environment thats the one that theres a lot of moving pieces as you say loan growth is relatively tepid as we speak for us and for the industry overall so itll be dependent upon that in terms of positive operating leverage and i would say its too early to call mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and last followup your increase in cet1 ratio due to a lot of balance sheet optimization did come at a cost of less assets less loan growth less earnings right theres a tradeoff in that so now that youre under kind of less pressure and have so much more flexibility do you think you can be a little bit more ph lax in terms of your growth and in turn that may help nii or is that too much of a stretch john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp we have flexibility now in terms of the transactions that we do to optimize and we still have plans to do those sorts of things weve identified some things that are going to be relatively neutral and a little bit on the low end of earnings impact and of course you saw some of those transactions in the second quarter pull through in terms of provision and things like that and that did lower our earning assets as you mentioned about billion or thereabouts this quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 great thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks mike operator and next well go to john pancari with evercore please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning i know despite the regulatory change around the cat ii requirement you maintained the bps to bps generation in cet1 quarterly why no change there can you just talk to us maybe about the give and takes in that expectation as the the need to meet the category ii shifted to category iii why no change there john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well i think theres no change because we feel like given the new rule set and things like that over time well have to transition into the new regime which will include aoci and so all of the other rules and so were going to be in a mode to continue to accrete that capital and that basis points to basis points is our earnings stream that we will accrete and like this quarter for example is basis points but we anticipate going to basis points or on the higher end of that range as we get through the mergerrelated costs and we have the union synergies john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay so the less bso activities didnt materially benefit that expectation john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp im sorry could you say that more i couldnt hear you john pancari q analyst evercore isi the less riskweighted asset optimization efforts that would be needed now under the need to meet category iii did not materially impact the basis points to basis points of earnings generation expected us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp no that did not no that did not and like for example this quarter we had basis points of rwa actions which included some of the asset reduction you saw earning assets lower for example as well as some other transactions embedded so we separate out the core earnings when were talking about basis points basis points core earnings from other rwa optimization transactions that we have the ability to do john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then separately is there any opex impact of the of now needing to conform to the category iii versus the more immediate requirements of category ii anything on the expense side and then separately on your margin bottoming comment anything in terms of the trajectory in the margin that you would expect after you see this bottoming as we head into thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so in terms of opex no theres no further investment you may recall before tailoring we had many of the same rules and standards that we had in terms of liquidity rules and reporting and all those sorts of things so we have all the capabilities built up or can quickly get to that level from an operational standpoint so theres no worries there in terms of the net interest margin we mentioned just a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and then bottoming out likely stable but itll still depend on interest rates quite frankly at that particular point in time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator and next well go to john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead oh one moment here well move past that and pardon me well go to scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning scott john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning scott us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks for taking the question just as it relates to sort of the balance sheet growth dynamic so great to see you out of that fed restriction do you see any risk that youd exceed billion in assets organically or come into contact with any of the other cat ii restrictions organically in the timeframe that would subject you to cat ii rules before your peers would have to get there under new levels in other words im just trying to kind of make sure that this is indeed just a full free and clear so just curious your thoughts there john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp it is as andy mentioned theres no asset cap so that we have complete flexibility here on our balance sheet going forward so if we elect to grow or want to grow and we do want to grow in a capitalefficient manner we will do so what i would say though is that were going to be emphasizing higherreturn loans and deemphasizing lowerreturn type of assets and i think that will manifest itself as the balance sheet churns and in addition to that i would just highlight that in this environment right now the loan outlook is pretty low the demand for loans is quite low given a number of different reasons out there but that gives us kind of the confidence that we have a lot have more time and flexibility here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thank you and then i think you might have touched on this in an earlier question but maybe if you can sort of rewalk us through the sort of aoci burndown and cash flow expectations coming off the both the afs and htm books and then i think you might have given the duration of the afs book but do you have that for the htm book as well john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so in terms of the afs and htm were at about in terms of balances about billion or so and its about a mix as we mentioned in the call in terms of afs and htm so we have about as i mentioned billion of runoff per quarter on average just given the current interest rate environment and things of that variety in terms of our profile weve been able to hedge about of the fixed rate portion of the afs book and so thats what has driven the duration of that particular book in the three and half less than threeandhalf years as we have the htm book is principally all agency mortgagebacked securities which have longer lives and so its more in the six or so sixandhalf range in terms of the duration of that book r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right wonderful thank you guys for taking the question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks scott operator and next well go to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning erika john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc andy my first question is for you probably yesterdays announcement is a big win for the company and as we think about combining that relief with a generally tighter regulatory environment what cet1 are you looking at and what level are you looking at in terms of okay now im at the right level this is now my target in the new world and now in an environment where balance sheet growth is minimal at best right i can now return capital back to shareholders through buybacks i guess im just wondering because theres your printed cet your gaap cet1 theres the adjusted that john gave right but then you only have to take into account of that ph billion by july if we get to a final date by then so theres a lot of moving pieces so as your investors think about all this progress that youve made plus this relief what is your new target is that transitional or fully phased in and whats the bogey that investors could look forward to that you would hit before returning capital through buybacks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes erika i understand the question and first of all i just want to highlight were back to which is where we started before the deal and were able to build and we went from to and build the basis points in basically less than a year which i thought was a great effort across the company in terms of what our new target is i think our shortterm target is to continue to build as we talked about remember theres two sets of rules that are yet to be finalized and coming down number one are the basel iii end game finalization of rules which will in one way shape or form increase capital levels and the second is clarity on ccar well set those targets once we have clarity on those two items erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and so just to follow up here at least until june ccar results regardless of how quickly you build the capital either on an adjusted or on a gaap basis youre going to continue to be at pause on the buyback until at least then until we see the ccar and the scb andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 thats my expectation erika we want clarity on the finalization of the basel iii and then ccar importantly so well be continuing to build capital and determine our capital targets and buffers and all that activity once we have more clarity on the finalization of the rules erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very clear and just one more for john if i may andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc in terms of the net interest income trajectory i think the fourth quarter bottom is good news especially relative to what we thought two days ago which would be more rwa mitigation as we think about the rwa mitigation ahead thats less impactful to eps should we think about it similar to what we saw early in the year in terms of securitizations are you more actively are you kind of going to continue to use creditlinked notes which i assume is cost you or so of the pool plus sofr and spread and as we think about those dynamics do you feel like you have to warehouse more liquidity as we anticipate lcr rules for regional banks because were also hearing that there could be pretty significant haircuts on how theyre thinking about htm as hqla john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure erika so maybe ill start with your last point on lcr we will in addition to what andy said on the capital side were going to have to wait and see what it is on the liquidity side in terms of any potential changes that come out of lcr we feel very comfortable that well be able to achieve whatever that change is and feel that well be able to achieve that whatever that scenario is well work into it in terms of you talked about the net interest income we feel like again just to kind of reiterate were looking for that to bottom at this particular point in time in the fourth quarter and where it kind of goes from there post it will depend in part by interest rates erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and congratulations on the release of commitments andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks erika john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator and next well go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi andy john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc how are you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc andy obviously us bancorp has developed a reputation of being a strong underwriter and weve talked about this in the past with you folks and i was wondering if you could frame out the environment because every bank is talking about credit normalization as you guys did because we had such great numbers coming out of the pandemic on credit and if you just exclude for a moment the economy because obviously none of us can control that but id really be interested in what you guys are seeing from a competitive standpoint in terms of underwriting and if you could compare it to past cycles obviously weve been around for a few cycles and can compare it but im curious from your guys vantage point is it as risky today as it may have been in or any color there that you can share with us andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp well let me give you the big picture and im going to ask terry to highlight some specifics i would say the consumer is entering this cycle in very strong shape from a balance standpoint from the perspective of savings accounts that they have the spend activity i think are all starting to normalize but normalize to a prepandemic what i would say normal level the companies and small businesses are also in very good shape the one area that were all very focused on is commercial real estate office which is one of the areas that we increased our reserve to as you know its at this quarter so maybe terry you can go into some specifics terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah and what i would add to that gerard is as you know when we think about underwriting we really underwrite through a cycle we try to take into consideration stress from an underwriting perspective what could happen in terms of rise in interest rates or other economic factors that could come into play so we havent adjusted our underwriting standards a lot as we have been thinking about this particular cycle i do think that us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 when you end up looking at the industry i think there is some tightening thats going on out there certainly from a competitive standpoint we are seeing that to some extent but we feel like were in pretty good shape if you end up looking at our situation as andy said probably the area that were monitoring the most is commercial real estate office space specifically we have a reserve thats about of the overall balance there we have been increasing that and were likely to continue to increase that because thats going to be a pressure point but were starting from if you think about the overall portfolio were starting at a fairly low point our nonaccrual loans is only basis points of total loans our allowance is strong at delinquencies are still at relatively low levels although increasing and our expectation as we go into is that that normalization will continue delinquencies will continue to kind of move up and nonperforming assets will continue to move up but i think were in a really good position in terms of the allowance coverage that we have and we feel pretty good about that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good good to hear your voice terry just to follow up on what you were saying from a competitive standpoint do you sense the extreme of course was when all of the crazy lending was being done by some banks but also the nonbanks when you guys look at the nonbank competitors are there rogue players out there that are just doing crazy things so that the second derivative impacts the banks not because any of the banks yourself included made a poor underwriting decision but it was the competitors that really did something foolish and now the banks are suffering a bit terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah i think gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc or again not like im not suggesting were there but terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc just yeah from a comparison standpoint terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp i think both in the bank and in the nonbank space i think that people are being fairly rational part of the issue is that its maybe more so on the demand side of the equation as much as anything i think corporate america is being relatively cautious out there theyre still waiting to see where interest rates settle in at and until they see more certainty with respect to what the interest rate and inflationary environment looks like i think corporate america is being relatively cautious and therefore demand is relatively soft but were not seeing what i would us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 say crazy things either on the bank or on the nonbank side at this particular point in time in fact were probably seeing if you end up looking at commercial real estate probably a pullback across the board gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then as my second followup question andy it was obviously great news that you guys had yesterday about the release is there any readthrough obviously you sat down with the regulators to get that release and they seem to be fairly rational in their decision to make that change theres been a lot of hope and criticism that the basel iii end game proposals are pretty darn strict do you think is there any readthrough where we may actually see some rationality with the regulators and they may kind of pare back some of those requirements or is that too far of a stretch terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp too early andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think the regulators have asked for feedback the banks will provide feedback both collectively and individually i think a lot of the feedback is good feedback because of the consequences to our customers and i think thats the area of focus that were going to be very pointed on in terms of our feedback and we want to make sure that from a banking standpoint were able to serve our customers and the rule set will create some friction around that in certain categories and thats where were going to focus in and my anticipation is that the fed will listen to our perspectives and thats my hope gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah and i gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah go ahead im sorry go ahead terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp i was just going to say and particularly it can be punitive with respect to low and moderate income customer base you see some capital rules related to renewable energy tax credits that dont make that seem punitive at this particular point in time so i do think theres a number of different areas where theres opportunity for adjustment gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 great thank you guys andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gerard operator and next well go to vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning vivek terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning shifting gears from capital given that youve made a lot of progress to just our normal business payments youve talked andy about wanting to grow much in processing mid to highsingle digits really more in the highsingle digits and some of the others in the lowdouble digits like corporate payments any color on any thoughts on how you get back up there because that hasnt been the case last couple of quarters what you need to do or change or what would help you get there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp im going to ask john to start then ill add in john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so in terms of merchant processing we have been making a number of investments over the years and continue to expect that highsingle digit in terms of the merchant sort of thing the numbers have been strong this quarter but theres normalization that has been happening and so in the quarters that have the quarterto quarter here the last several quarters theres been a lot of of the nuances coming out of the covid and all those sorts of things so if you think about airline tickets and hotels and corporate te those have been very strong but theyre normalizing that said services and retail have been strong and so and the retail print that we saw yesterday was very constructive so we feel like theres good underpinnings there in addition to the investments that we make to continue to believe and give us confidence in that in our projections there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and i think two of those most important investments vivek are our techled initiative which is about a third of our revenue base right now is techled from a perspective of new activity and secondly is that what weve talked a lot about which is this business payments ecosystem which continues to be a top priority for the company because i think its a huge opportunity for our business banking customer base as well as our commercial us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 customer base and then you add in what were getting from union bank i think thats why were confident in that higher singledigit increase vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then another fee business that you mentioned youre expanding capital market since youre not doing your investor days anymore any color on what youre doing there to expand that youve always had the loan syndications and debt capital markets what else are you doing to step that up in terms of the level of revenues from that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure this is john so the weve this is another area where we have continued to make investments in back end systems and the frontline and acquiring talent and all these sorts of things and its been a great story for us and we continue to invest in this going forward and along with highgrade and underwriting theres high yield as well as what other areas that have been very strong is in the derivative market providing interest rate hedging products for our clients especially in this time where interest rates are moving around quite a bit thats a service that has been highly needed foreign exchange has been a growing component here as well and particularly now with union bank we have more of a west coast customer base and more of a foreign exchange need in addition to some of the businesses that we work with in the corporate trust side we have as you know we have businesses in europe as well so theres always some form of foreign exchange and so weve seen a lot of growth there in addition to that weve been gaining market share in the investment grade business and high yield over the the coming days i think weve had an investment grade in the top now in terms of market share so that has been a business that has continued to advance slow and steady and its been a good item for us business for us vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks operator operator instructions and next well go to matt oconnor with deutsche bank andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was wondering slide shows some of the revenue opportunities i was wondering if you could size that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp indiscernible matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc starting with the ub deal the revenue synergies related to the ub deal that you outline on slide is there any way to frame how big that might be or in what timeframe andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp it is a high priority for each of our businesses probably the greatest priority is the first one we highlight which is our credit card opportunity the payments business is a strength of us bank our card offering is terrific and weve already had a penetration increase from where we started and that continues to be a focus and then you think about that with the business clients as well i think that it is a material impact but were still working through exactly the sizing and timing and well continue to update on that but it is a priority and a focus area for each of our businesses matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately a little bit of a technical question i forget some of my cfa materials but when we look at the securities book of a duration of less than threeandhalf years but youre only burning down through remind me how that math works and does the burndown kind of step up as we think about right because the duration is pretty short and the burndown is not all that much in the first couple of years john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah the function of the curve really changed as is that the we saw the curve flatten out quite a bit this quarter what id say on that is we have a number of securities that obviously are fixed rate that have longer durations to them or longer average lives and so and then we have a number of with our the security portion there where we have swaps that is very low duration its three months or so because of how it swapped to the floating rate index so in addition to that as weve added on some of the security book we have about billion or so of when we did some of the ph auto repack transactions in the fourth quarter of last year as well as the second quarter of this year that is very short as well in addition to some of the floating rate securities within that book so its kind of more of a barbell approach which gives you the duration of it which just gives us a value change for a move in interest rates but in terms of the burndown thatll depend in part about how the shape and the type of securities that are within the book matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 okay thats helpful obviously less relevant now given the feds decision but still something were all tracking so thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks matt operator and next we can go to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys thanks so just one more followup on the category ii news i just want to make sure were super clear so does billion stop being a bind forever or obviously you dont have to cross on the prior potential timeframe but to the prior question just wondering you said theres you dont have an asset cap so does that mean that category ii is now a nonthing for us bank going forward in any time period or when you cross naturally do you still get on the natural clock of having to comply just wondering how that fits in with the news you got yesterday andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so were bound ken by the current rule set which is after four quarters of an average of billion then you would go to category ii or the new basel iii rule set which is yet to be finalized as you said but the current rule set is what were bound on so billion still is important but what were saying is given where we think asset growth will be given our continued optimization in certain categories given our focus on highreturn businesses we do not see that as a hurdle to growth ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood okay thats what i wanted to clarify thank you andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator and with
