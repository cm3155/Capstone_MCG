our website these disclosures cover our presentation materials prepared comments and qa i will now turn the call over to john john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today this morning we reported first quarter earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of however adjusted items reconciled with our earnings supplement and press release represent an approximate negative impact on our reported results for the first quarter total revenue was billion on a reported basis and billion on an adjusted basis as both net interest income and fee revenue demonstrated resiliency in the face of lingering macroeconomic and political uncertainty adjusted noninterest expenses increased quarteroverquarter and is expected to represent a high water mark for the year as seasonal impacts offset our ongoing expense management actions average loans were lower quarteroverquarter reflecting limited client demand client selectivity paydowns and an increase in debt capital markets activities average and ending deposits continued to grow during the quarter consistent with seasonal patterns credit continues to perform in line with our expectations while pressure remains within pockets of business lending our consumers remain strong and healthy we anticipate overall asset quality will perform consistent with historical levels experienced prior to the pandemic in closing we feel good about the successful execution of our strategic plan as evidenced by our solid top line revenue which allows us to continue delivering consistent sustainable longterm performance while focused on soundness profitability and growth now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 david j turner jr chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential quarter basis within the business portfolio average loans declined as modest increases associated with funding previously approved in investor real estate construction loans were offset by declines in ci lending approximately million of ci loans were refinanced off balance sheet through the debt capital markets during the quarter average consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in residential mortgage enerbank and consumer credit card were offset by declines in home equity and runoff portfolios we expect average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to from a deposit standpoint deposits increased on average and ending basis which is typical for the first quarter tax refund season in the second quarter we expect to see declines in overall balances reflecting the impact of tax payments the mix of deposits continue to shift from noninterestbearing to interestbearing products though the pace of remixing has continued to slow our analysis of the trends and overall customer spending behavior gives us confidence that by midyear well have a noninterestbearing mix in the low area which corresponds to approximately billion to billion of potential further decline in low interest savings and checking balances so lets shift to net interest income as expected net interest income declined by approximately linked quarter and the net interest margin declined basis points deposit remixing and cost increases continue to pressure net interest income the full rising rate cycle interestbearing deposit beta is now and we continue to expect to peak in the mid range offsetting this pressure asset yields continue to benefit from higher rates through the maturity and replacement of lower yielding fixed rate loans and securities we expect net interest income to reach a bottom in the second quarter followed by growth over the second half of the year as deposit trends continue to improve and the benefits of fixed rate asset turnover persist the narrowed net interest income range between billion and billion portrays a wellprotected profile under a wide array of possible economic outcomes performance in the range will be driven mostly by our ability to reprice deposits a relatively small portion of interestbearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase in the cycle mostly index deposits and cds weve taken steps to increase flexibility such as shortening promotional cd maturities and reducing promotional rates if the fed remains on hold net interest income likely falls in the lower half of the range assuming modest incremental funding cost pressure so lets take a look at fee revenue which experienced strong performance this quarter adjusted noninterest income increased during the quarter as most categories experienced growth particularly in capital markets improvement in capital markets was driven by increased real estate debt capital markets and ma activity a portion of both real estate and ma activities were pushed into the first quarter from yearend as clients delayed transactions late in the first quarter we also closed on the bulk purchase of the rights to service billion of residential mortgage loans we have a lowcost servicing model so youll see us continue to look for additional opportunities we continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be between billion and billion lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expense increased compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by seasonal hrrelated expenses and productionbased incentive payments operational losses also ticked up during the quarter the increase is attributable to checkrelated warranty claims from deposits that occurred last year despite this increase hiring activity has normalized to expected levels and we continue to expect full year operational losses to be approximately million regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 we remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business we will continue focusing on our largest expense categories which include salaries and benefits occupancy and vendor spend we continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately billion with first quarter representing the high water mark for the year from an asset quality standpoint overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected adjusted net chargeoffs increased basis points driven primarily by a large legacy restaurant credit and one commercial manufacturing credit as a reminder we exited our fast casual restaurant vertical in and the remaining portfolio is relatively small total nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter and continued to normalize towards historical averages while total delinquencies improved nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to basis points due primarily to downgrades within industries previously identified as under stress we expect npls to continue to normalize towards historical averages provision expense was million or million in excess of net chargeoffs resulting in a basis point increase in the allowance for credit loss ratio to the increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization and incrementally higher qualitative adjustments for risk in certain portfolios previously identified as under stress we continue to expect our full year net chargeoff ratio to be between basis points and basis points lets turn to capital and liquidity we expect to maintain our common equity tier ratio consistent with current levels over the near term this level will provide sufficient flexibility to make proposed changes along with the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings we ended the quarter with an estimated common equity tier ratio of while executing million in share repurchases and million in common dividends during the quarter with that well move to the qa portion of the call regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you good morning john and david david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc david just following up on your comment around noninterestbearing deposits sitting mid i guess low by mid2024 just give us a sense of if we dont get any rate cuts do you see that dipping below based on what youre seeing in terms of customer behavior and just use of balances im assuming theres some attrition on consumer balances thats at play here so like where do you see that mix bottoming out and whats the latest that youre seeing in terms of pricing competition across the markets thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so from a balance standpoint we still feel pretty confident based on flows that we have seen and expect that wed be in that low range we continue to look to grow noninterestbearing balances through new checking accounts new operating accounts thats whats important to us thats what fuels our profitability and so being in the favorable places in particular in the southeast where theres migration of businesses i think will give us some comfort that we can grow there we talked about deposits bottoming out in the first half of the year and then maybe growing a little bit from there so i think that low range is a good still a good level with regards to competition on pricing i think at the end of the day we havent seen across the industry a lot of loan growth and as a result of that competition for deposits is not as strong as it could have been had we had a lot of loan demand we always have competition we have to be fair and balanced with our customers and making sure that we are creating value and so we look at what our competitors are doing from a price standpoint and we adjust accordingly but theres nothing unusual thats happening there and i think the biggest driver of that is because of the lack of loan growth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just a separate question as we think about capital deployment that you outlined on slide is there more to go in terms of just the appetite for securities repositioning and how much should we expect in terms of what you did in with regards to the lift in the second quarter to volumes thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so we consistently challenge ourselves on whats the best use of our capital that we generate obviously were at a robust common equity tier we think were close enough to be in striking distance on whatever the regime changes with regards to capital and again with loan growth being muted in the industry we want to pay a fair dividend so were generating capital that needs to be put to work we did buy the shares back or we do things like securities repositioning we did the million in the first quarter well continue to look for opportunities i would say that proofs not as close to the ground as it was because we want to keep our payback less than years and frankly closer to years if we can get it our payback in this last trade was about years and so we think that was a great use of capital for us and so well look to do that but were not committing to it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc helpful thank you operator our next question comes from line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you for taking the question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning i was hoping you could please flesh out some of the rationale behind the softened loan growth outlook i certainly understand it given the backdrop and what were seeing in the indiscernible data but it in ways contrasts with some peers who might be expecting more of an acceleration in the second half so just curious to hear your updated thoughts on customer demand and how theyre thinking david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well on the consumer side as we mentioned we did a pretty good job growing mortgage growing enerbank growing card but it was offset by declines in home equity which made consumers flat consumers are actually in really good shape we feel good about that we just dont see a lot of loan growth netnet loan growth relative to commercial depending on the industry some industries are blowing and going and others are being careful at this point weve had nice production but weve had payoffs paydowns and of course this past quarter we had million of debt placements through our ma group that helped us from an nir standpoint but obviously hurt us from a balance standpoint if we start seeing rates actually decline that activity will pick up and so netnet it is going to be hard to grow meaningfully through all of that activity and were fine with that we dont need to push in this environment theres still uncertainty we dont need to push for loan growth we need to be careful regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 on client selectivity johns talked about that numerous times and we want to be careful we clearly have the capital and liquidity to do so and if we see opportunities well grow but were not going to force it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then separately i was hoping you could discuss the additional operational losses definitely glad to see no change to the full year expectation though they were elevated in the first quarter maybe just an additional color were there new instances of the issues that have cropped up last year or are these just sort of trueups and what gives you confidence that all the issues are still resolved and everything john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah this is john so there were no new events the tail with respect to the bridge in warranty claims was a little longer than we anticipated and as a result we did incur some additional losses in the quarter what gives us confidence that we can meet our expectations is the exit rate for the quarter was significantly reduced which implies that the countermeasures we put in place the talent that we recruited for our fraud prevention activities all of that is working and gives us confidence that we can in fact meet our million target for the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much for taking the questions john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 so one question just on how were thinking about nii for the full year in relation to loan growth being a little slower so i just wanted to understand your nii guide obviously is the same as it was before loan growth expectations are a little slower understandably so how do i square those things thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thanks well loan growth we had talked about being in the back half of the year so you werent going to get a lot of carry from loan growth in our guidance and so really what we want to see loan growth for the back half of the year is setting us up for not for so that was never factored into the guidance that we gave you on nii we feel good about where were positioned from a balance sheet standpoint with a basically neutral to shortterm rates and we have a little bit of shape to the curve where we reinvest our securities book and were picking up little over basis points basis points on that front book back book so it gives us confidence there that were going to do pretty well with regards to the nii and if you look at the input cost so our deposit cost theyve also started to flatten if we look at the months of february and march there was little change in our deposit costs so our cumulative beta which is at today we said would be in the mid we have a lot of confidence in that so thats why we didnt change our nii guide betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it that makes a lot of sense and then just on the securities repositioning that you talked about on slide is it just wanted to understand how youre thinking about the goforward here you added some duration again makes sense but wanted to know if youre thinking of leaning in even more like how long are you comfortable extending the duration of the securities book thats basically the question thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well our extension duration was only like basis points a year so its negligible and betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc fair david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp from our standpoint especially if you believe the risk of rates going up as very low you believe theyre either flat to down then perhaps taking a little duration risk where you get compensated for it make some sense today our duration naturally is declining so doing the trade to kind of keep it flat to modestly higher than where we are right now seems to make sense and its a good use of capital if we can get a payback like i said the one we just did our payback is years wed like it to be less than years closer to years if we can and so while we wont commit to doing that we would look at it and if we did it would be no more than what you just experienced we want to keep it at a fairly small percentage of our pretax income betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i got it thanks so much really appreciate it regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 operator our next question comes from line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the credit front we saw about a moderate increase in nonperformers in the quarter however your loan loss reserve is pretty stable despite the move in reserves i mean the nonperformers just wondered if youd give a little bit of color on how youre thinking about the reserves here and also maybe you can give a little bit more color behind the nonperformers john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah john maybe ill start this is john turner first of all so we began signaling now a couple of quarters ago stress in a couple of specific portfolios or industries office senior housing transportation healthcare specifically goods and services and technology and the increases that we are seeing in nonaccrual loans and classified loans are largely consistent with the indication that there is stress in those particular industries in fact when you look at our nonaccruals of our nonaccruals excuse me credits make up of our nonaccruals and of those credits are in those five sectors that i mentioned so we did anticipate that we would see some deterioration and thats been consistent with our expectations the second thing id point to is several quarters ago we began to set the expectation that we would return to pre pandemic historical levels of credit metrics and specifically that would be an average chargeoff ratio of about basis points and nonaccruals of basis points and again we have trended back to those ranges which is consistent with our expectations with regard to the allowance we go through the process every quarter to ensure that we are properly reserved against expectation for loss in those portfolios given that we have a very high degree of visibility into the credits that make up of our nonaccruals you can expect that we feel very good about our reserve position john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you thanks for that and then separately on the expense front i know you mentioned that the first quarter should represent the high water mark on expenses is that primarily because of the elevated operating losses or do you expect some building efficiency through the remainder of the year either given the backdrop or given the revenue picture david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp its several things and we have probably million worth of expense we can point to on different fronts so part of it is operational losses that we dont think will repeat we obviously have the first quarter issues with regards to payroll taxes and things of that nature we have hr asset valuation thats offsetting nir thats part of that too we have some things in occupancy and professional fees if you add all that up its about million and we have pretty good confidence that that wont repeat we tried to signal that the first quarter was going to be the high regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 water mark and that you couldnt take the billion and divide it by four and were sticking to that and were sticking to our guidance that we have and we have pretty good confidence we did take some actions this quarter like we did in the fourth quarter from a severance standpoint now the first quarter has the normal expense of payroll for those folks in addition to the severance so that wont repeat so all that like i said adds up to right around million john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and thats just we have other opportunities to reduce expenses as well thats just an indicator of what we can pretty quickly identify wont repeat john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah and if i could ask just one followup related to that the status of your core systems conversion is that still trending as expected in terms of timing and cost john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp it is yeah we in fact just had a board meeting this week and went through all that with our board we feel good about the project and the progress that were making and our ability to stay on budget on time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for taking my questions john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you good morning i wonder if david you could talk a little bit about that bullet you put in on slide about stable deposit costs february to march and what our takeaway should be in terms of mix shift pricing movement et cetera and i know you talked about still mid indiscernible deposit betas but just whats changing underneath in terms of that stability that youre starting to see david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 yeah part of one of the big reasons we put that in there is because our deposit cost change was higher than what youre seeing from peers but thats because of what we did in the fourth quarter and you had a full quarter effect of that now that weve kind of got that baked into the base and we start seeing offers and things of that nature on the deposit offerings coming down the exit in february and march gives us a lot of confidence that those deposit costs are stabilizing and therefore we have a lot of confidence that our cumulative beta being in the mid so a couple more points from where we are today ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and i guess as a followup are you starting to change pricing change offers bring in duration what are you doing in terms of trying to take that point further david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah thats a good point ken and so yes we started that last quarter actually we had some ceding maturities coming that were longerdated month cds and we went shorter in the to 7month range to be able to reprice those this year with the original expectation that rates would be coming down sooner than they probably are now and so yeah and we can see from a competitive standpoint we want to be competitive we dont have to lead with price but we do need to be fair and balanced and so youre starting see the benefit of having the promotional rates coming down here ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and on that last point about the higher for longer youve talked about the billion to billion of fixed rate production for a while now and you said thats per year has the benefit from that also does that get better and higher for longer and how does that differ when you think about like this year versus next year thanks david david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i would say marginally higher for longer because you have a lot of securities that are repricing that were picking up about basis points today were picking up call it basis points on the loan side so if you get and we expect to get the deposit cost stabilized then the repricing can actually start overwhelming the cost that you had on the deposit side that has not been the case thus far its been just opposite so youre going to see that turn which is why were calling the bottom for us in the second quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks david operator our next question comes from line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just on credit regarding the large restaurant credit and the commercial manufacturing credit could you guys quantify the impacts on net chargeoffs and provision this quarter and if you could just give some additional background on where you are on the resolution process there that would be great david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so if you were to look at those two added together just those two made about basis points of charge offs so if we didnt have those two our basis points would have been basis points david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then where are you guys in the process of resolving this david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp say that again david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc where are you in the process of resolving those credits john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp theyre both still being worked out david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and i guess just bigger picture with you reiterating the net chargeoff guide here for the year of bps to bps youre at the high end of that right now so youre expecting that to either remain stable here or decline through the end of the year and you have confidence around that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp we do john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yes regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then just switching to deposits with the recent inflation data thats been elevated and the shift expectations to fewer rate cuts this year are you noticing any impacts from any of that on your corporate deposit customers behavior at all are you seeing any change in activity there and does that impact your expected range of nib remix at all for the year david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp no our nib largely comes from our consumer base we do obviously have a big nib on the commercial side i think folks are going to move out of nib to seek rate have done so and we think that thats why were calling for our nib to decline a little bit but still stay in the low range and they all just want to maintain a little bit more liquidity going into a cycle it still has uncertainty geopolitical risk our own elections this year but no i dont think from an inflation standpoint were going to see a huge change from nib david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the fee trends the deposit service ph charges were up nicely and i know the treasury management is a big part of that and a positive driver but there is weaker seasonality so just wondering if you can flesh that out john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so if you look at just talk about fee revenue across different parts of the business treasury management is up yearoveryear and thats a reflection both of increases in fees and increases in relationships and activities so the nice growth in that business similarly wealth management is up over yearoveryear which is both reflective of increases in asset valuations and increases in assets held for customers increasing relationships we also saw really nice increase in mortgage activity during the quarter and we would expect that to continue consumer fees are down modestly and thats a reflection really of the implementation of all the changes weve made to benefit customers with respect to overdrafts and more specifically as a result of the implementation of overdraft grace weve seen about a reduction in the number of customers who are actually overdrawn so that is resulting in some decline in fee revenue offset currently by interchange activity customers use of their debit card so generally fee income is solid were seeing good growth in the wholesale parts of our business and in wealth management that reflect growth in relationships and growth in activities regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then in capital markets that also came in strong and i think you had this like million to million range in the past with room for upside and just talk to were there any deals that just talk to how sustainable you think that is obviously its somewhat marketdependent but a little more color on the one key driver there and the thoughts going forward thanks john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i think we still stick to that range generally and incorporate our expectations for capital markets into the broader guidance around billion to billion in adjusted nir but we do see good pipelines capital markets activity is picking up theres more ma activity were seeing more customers go the institutional market to raise debt which has been helpful our ma activity was pretty diverse during the quarter and then real estate capital markets which is a really important business for us is also very active and so we feel pretty good about the million to million range for the quarter matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning john good morning david david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp hey gerard before you ask a question let me clean something up from a question that just came up on terms of what the chargeoff percentage would have been had we not had those two large credits i said basis points its basis points actually so we would have been at basis points had we not had those two i did do the math correctly i just want to make sure that gets fixed in the transcript gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good all set john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp go ahead gerard david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp fire away regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you can you guys give us an update where the proposal is going for the longterm debt and when do you think that will be finalized in the npr thats out there and second as part of that what your latest estimate is i know you have given us some color on this in the past but what are you latest estimate on what it might cost you once you have to and your peers of course have to issue the debt and carry higher levels of debt david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so gerard the whole basel iii and longterm debt has kind of gone into a little bit of a hole at the time were not sure when that will get taken care of we suspect it will be this year at some point the proposal on debt was to have of rwa which is about billion for us ill give you credit for what you have outstanding which is a couple of billion so youre talking about raise of billion we can leverage that and put it to work and it wasnt a terrible drag on the nii less than drag on the nii for us if fully implemented and this was going to take time to do that we need to have some our billion of existing longterm debt is something we were going to address just in the natural order of things but with loan growth being muted theres no need to go out and raise debt if you dont have to have it were hoping that the proposal though comes down from the number theres been talk of it maybe being in the to range of rwa but we dont know well just have to adapt and overcome when the rule gets put out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup youve been very clear about the identification of the stress portfolios with credit in your prepared comments david you mentioned that some of the increase in the nonperformers was due to i think you said yeah some of it was due to the downgrades in certain those industries that youve identified can you share with us within those downgrades what process or not the process but what caused the downgrades was it debt service coverage was it the business the borrowers business is deteriorating for some reason can you give a little more color on the downgrade part of that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp its broad usually so were seeing strength in consumers and businesses in general there are pockets of stressed industries that john mentioned earlier i think at the end of the day they seem to be more idiosyncratic to the business model of that borrower and these are valuation charges that are being taken and so you dont have any one when you kind of cut to the chase you think about credit risk actually being fairly good right now but youre going to have these pockets these oneoff pockets as i just mentioned just two credits for us its a big deal in terms of the effect on the chargeoff percentage so we dont see it as a contagion as much as we see it as an idiosyncratic business issue gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see so it wasnt really like an across the board the higher rate environment for these downgrades really affected it but it was more idiosyncratic for each one of the borrowers regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i think the one exception to that gerard would be transportation where we are seeing that industry particularly the truckload industry and smaller borrowers is under some stress and valuations equipment valuations are also under stress and obviously you think about real estaterelated portfolios office and senior housing in particular you can understand why those are also under stress but transportation would be the one area where i would say it feels like across that industry for the truckload related the less than truckload businesses are still doing okay but truckrelated carriers are having challenges gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from line of christopher spahr with wells fargo please proceed with your question christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc so my question is just relating the shift in loan mix over the last few years with enerbank and comparing it to the average prepandemic chargeoffs and just kind of your thoughts on where you think the mix has shifted a little bit and might have impacted the comparisons and then just thoughts about the enerbank kind of portfolio itself it seems to be holding up a little bit better than expected thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well let me couch it in terms of just our overall portfolio from a seasonal standpoint so if you go back to pre pandemic so the fourth quarter when we all implemented cecl our cecl reserve at that time was if you adjust that for the portfolio we have today so theres pluses and minuses just a completely different mix and apply those same loss rates to our current portfolio that would imply a cecl reserve of i think thats on one of our slides and so i think at the end of the day we have pretty robust reserves to cover expected losses the stress portfolios that weve talked about are a driver the lower fico bands of consumer have more pressure on it than the rest of the consumer base and some of the portfolios that weve added whether it be enerbank or ascentium those are higher yield portfolios and they have higher loss content in both cases we had those two portfolios enerbank and ascentium at call it expectation and theyre performing in line with that and i think it gets back to the fact that that businesses and consumers generally speaking are in pretty good shape so weve been real careful making sure we dont grow too fast in those portfolios and so far everythings worked according to plan regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator our final question comes from the line of peter winter with d a davidson please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson hi good morning just one quick question last quarter you mentioned an exit rate for the nim around im just wondering if youre still comfortable with that just on the one hand youre building more liquidity but then you did the securities restructuring david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i think we should get pretty close to that number still again were not counting on rates being a huge driver incrementally though if we have the long end that stays higher then our reinvestment yields are a little bit better if short rates come down then our negative carry on our swap book will be helped and that could propel us so i would say the upper to we are carrying a bit more cash you probably saw that just out of abundance of caution given the events of
