afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the fourth quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share for the full year capital one earned billion or per share included in the results for the fourth quarter were two adjusting items which collectively benefited pretax earnings by million net of these adjustments fourth quarter earnings per share were and fullyear earnings per share were on a linked quarter basis periodend loans grew and average loans grew driven by growth in our domestic card business this loan growth coupled with net interest margin expansion drove revenue up on a linked quarter basis noninterest expense grew in the linked quarter driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat net of the adjustments i mentioned earlier operating expenses were up provision in the quarter provision expense in the quarter was billion driven by net chargeoffs of billion and an allowance build of about billion turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail the billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company yearend allowance balance up to billion increasing the total company coverage ratio by basis points to ill cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide in our domestic card business the allowance balance increased by million bringing our coverage ratio to three things put upward pressure on our card allowance the first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio the second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago and finally we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter the impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances these three factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance increased by million driving a 20basis point increase in coverage to the build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business including lower recovery rates the second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook these two factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 and finally in our commercial business the allowance increased million resulting in a 9basis point increase in coverage to this was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio turning to page ill discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was well above the regulatory requirement total liquidity reserves increased by billion to billion strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior fhlb borrowings turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our net interest margin was in the fourth quarter basis points higher than the year ago quarter and basis points higher than the prior quarter the 4basis point linked quarter increase in nim was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift towards car loans this impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the fourth quarter up about basis points relative to last quarter the billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in riskweighted assets dividends and share repurchases we repurchased approximately million of common stock in the quarter bringing the repurchases for the full year to billion we continue to estimate that our longerterm cet1 capital need is around with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you andrew and welcome everybody ill begin on slide with fourth quarter results in our credit card business yearoveryear growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide in the fourth quarter strong yearoveryear growth in every top line metric continued in our domestic card business purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up from the fourth quarter of ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear ending loans grew from the sequential quarter and revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre pandemic levels the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearover year the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points above the prior year on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the delinquency rate was up basis points noninterest expense was up from the fourth quarter of which includes an increase in marketing total company marketing expense was about billion in the quarter our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing in our domestic card business we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks were seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decadelong focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 slide shows fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business in the fourth quarter we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins auto originations declined yearoveryear and from the linked quarter driven by the decline in auto originations consumer banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters fourth quarter ending loans grew compared to the yearago quarter on a linked quarter basis ending loans were down fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up yearoveryear and up over the sequential quarter average deposits were up yearoveryear and up from the sequential quarter our digitalfirst national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction consumer banking revenue was up year overyear as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the yearoveryear decline in auto margins noninterest expense was up compared to the fourth quarter of driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank the auto chargeoff rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter the chargeoff rate for the fourth quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points slide shows fourth quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter fourth quarter ending loan balances were down and average loans were flat ending deposits were down from the linked quarter average deposits grew fourth quarter revenue was down from the linked quarter the decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was therefore neutral to the company excluding this impact fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about quarteroverquarter and up yearoveryear noninterest expense was up from the linked quarter the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate was basis points the criticized performing loan rate increased basis points from the linked quarter to and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up basis points from the linked quarter to in closing we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter loan growth in our consumer banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations consumer deposits grew and in our commercial banking business ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter chargeoff rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below prepandemic levels total company operating expense net of adjustments was up from the linked quarter our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year was net of adjustments a 15basispoints improvement from full year and we expect that the full year annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to pulling way up we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities we continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty powered by our modern digital technology were continuously improving our proprietary underwriting marketing and product capabilities were focusing on efficiency improvement and were managing capital prudently capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 as a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth were in a strong position to deliver compelling longterm shareholder value and thrive in a broad range in possible economic scenarios and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to our other investors and analysts who might wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have any followup questions after the qa session investor relations team will be available after the call victor please start the qa question and answer section operator thank you one moment for our first question our first question come from the line of mihir bhatia from bank of america your line is open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon and thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask about just the vintage seasoning or growth math as i think weve talked about in the past youve added a lot of loans here in last year and as these loans season i was just trying to wonder if you could maybe talk about just how you see that flowing through into your loss rates and what that does to your delinquency and loss goals here over the next to months thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah thank you let me just start with a reminder of what we mean by growth math as a general rule of thumb losses on new loans tend to ramp up over a couple of years and then peak and then gradually come down when we accelerate growth and especially when those new loans are added to a seasoned back book with low losses it can increase the overall level of losses of the portfolio we grew rapidly for example just looking back at when we talk a lot about growth math we grew rapidly in and and had a particularly visible growth math effect in the wake of that growth at that time the large front book was adding to a back book that was unusually seasoned because it had survived the great recession given our recent rate of growth i think its likely well see some growth math effect again over the next few years but i think the general normalization trend will be the bigger driver of our credit trajectory one other thing thats different about growth math going forward is cecl under the cecl accounting regime the allowance impacts of new growth are pulled forward significantly we havent seen this effect for most of the pandemic even as we have accelerated our growth because of the offsetting favorable factors in our allowance but as our growth continues a portion of our allowance builds going forward are intended to support that growth capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thanks and then just maybe on your reserve just trying to understand just some of the assumptions underlying the reserves maybe you could just talk about what youre assuming for unemployment reserve whether you have a recession built into the shortterm any additional color you can help us with there thank you andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure mihir as ive said in the past we are largely consumers of economic assumptions in this particular case for unemployment we are assuming something thats a little modestly higher than consensus estimates for where we will land in the fourth quarter i think consensus is somewhere around our baseline forecast gets up to around in the fourth quarter but its important to note theres a lot of other things that go into the calculation of the reserve things like unemployment or sorry changes in the unemployment rate inflation home prices wages all of those factors matter as well but our unemployment assumption is to be around in the fourth quarter or sorry around in the fourth quarter jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you one moment please jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp hello hello operator yes one moment please and our next question comes from the line of ashish sharma with capital one jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp hey victor i dont think thats right ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc was that intended for me jeff richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah ryan capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp hey ryan why dont you go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey sorry about that hey thanks guys so rich maybe i can ask mihirs one of mihirs questions in a slightly different manner so competitors in the industry are talking about reaching prepandemic loss levels by year end or maybe even overshooting those levels can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about the pace of normalization or maybe even overshooting those and maybe just talk a little bit about normalization versus parts of the portfolio if youre actually seeing any deterioration thanks and i have a followup richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thanks ryan so consumer credit metrics remain strong and of course as weve seen theyve been normalizing steadily through and are approaching prepandemic levels at first normalization was more pronounced in some segments more than others it was of course and by the way this is always the case that front book new originations tend to be higher so that would have been shocking had it been different but the other thing we also said and talked to investors about it was more normalization was happening everywhere but it was more pronounced at the lower end of the market more recently weve actually seen more uniform trend of normalization across businesses and segments so for example across various fico ranges and also across income levels when we index them on credit metrics back to where they were before the pandemic the sort of rest of the credit spectrum and rest of the income spectrums caught up to the very recently in the last few months to the lower end so really if i pull on that it looks like the normalization is pretty consistent across the board ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp and yeah go ahead ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc no no no go for it and ill ask my followup when you finish richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so you asked various competitors are forecasting or talking about different times at which things cross levels i think at capital one were not making specific predictions on that but i think the key thing i would have you look at is the delinquency metrics delinquency metrics are the best single predictor of where things are going to go in the near term and in fact if we look at flow rates we can see that very early flow rates into delinquency capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 buckets are pretty normalized so were not giving specific guidance but we would say look at the credit metrics look at the dynamics across other metrics but we feel this is its clearly normalizing as we see it ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then rich maybe to follow up on the comments regarding the efficiency being flat to modestly down i think last quarter you were talking about modest efficiency improvement there have been headlines about the firm reducing some head count so im just curious has anything changed in terms of your expectations for efficiency improvement and i guess given the pace of revenue growth thats expected and contemplated is there any acceleration in investments thats taking place to drive the stable to modestly efficient improving efficiency thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah ryan our efficiency outlook is exactly the same as it was last quarter if you recall actually we guided to the for full year for efficiency to be flat basically kind of flat to and then modestly down for relative to what happened is that came in a little bit lower so our guidance of flat to modestly down its the same outlook as we had before and so they know theres not big investments behind that its the continued journey of capital one to lean into our opportunities and continue to invest in the tech opportunities that we see and the opportunities to create breakthroughs in the marketplace and continue to transform how we work but pulling way up the sort of story if you kind of pull way back on operating efficiency the journey that where weve driven basis points of improvement from well through and then we had the whole pandemic thing but if i pull way up the gradual operating efficiency improvement is what we are continuing to drive for through the leveraging of our tech transformation even as we continue to invest ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color rich jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening how are you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hi betsy andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi okay so two questions one just as we think about the margin and the net interest margin net interest margin outlook can you give us a sense as to how youre thinking about deposit betas and how thats likely to roll here over the course of the year i noticed you talked a little bit earlier about deposit growth was really strong maybe give us a sense as to which types of deposits youre really leaning into at this stage and then help us understand how asset yields are likely to trend given a forward curve and im assuming is the base case but tell me if you have a different point of view on that thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah betsy ill start with your last question first which is we are following the forward curve assuming bps here in the first quarter and holding flat throughout before coming down in with respect to how were thinking about beta and asset yields as components of nim as we get into the latter part of this rate cycle lagged deposit rates really have a bigger impact than the asset yields that reprice more quickly and did so over the last couple of quarters as the fed was moving rapidly and so theres a bit of that sequential dynamic going on in terms of thinking about overall deposit beta and product mix roughly of our deposits are in consumer its where our focus lies and so if you just look at the cumulative deposit beta for the total company its around was low last quarter but if you look at the last increasing rate cycle i think the terminal beta was around so i could see a terminal beta being somewhere above that just given competitive dynamics in the marketplace at this point so i would say the net of all of those factors is likely to be a modest headwind to nim we talked last quarter about balance sheet mix and we are largely back to a prepandemic balance sheet mix from where we were a year ago and frankly our nim is roughly in a similar spot so i would say balance sheet mix over a multiple quarter period isnt likely to be a big driver unless we just see outsize growth in the highermargin card business and then the other factor that could prove to be a tailwind to potentially offset a little bit of the modest headwind that probably comes from the beta dynamics that i described is we could also see a bit of an increase in card revolve rates from where they are today so all of those things are just to leave you with a kind of a net impression that there are headwinds and potentially some tailwinds but the one thing i will just note as we look ahead to the first quarter as a reminder in the way we calculate nim day count has an effect so the one thing we know for sure is well have a basis point or so headwind in q1 due to having two fewer days in the quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats super helpful color as a followup i just wanted to get a sense as to how youre thinking about the outlook for marketing obviously a critical driver of growth and i know its been something that youve been very capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 successful with in generating that topofwallet customer but just wanted to see how we should think about that investment as we go into the next year with this nim headwind et cetera thanks jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp hey rich youre on mute richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp sorry betsy yes we continue to i feel very good about the traction that were getting in marketing of course most of the marketing that we do is in the card business we continue to see attractive growth opportunities across the business for new account origination we have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that were originating in we see evidence all over the place of the benefits of our tech transformation thats giving us some extra opportunity so we feel very good about that you mentioned of course how do we feel about leaning into this in the context of the potential looming downturn and what we do is we just continue to look all around the edges of our originations and look for places that either we would think might be particularly likely to have a challenge or be vulnerable or things that we see having any kind of performance issues and we sort of trim around the edges thats what weve been doing for three decades at capital one and we continue to do this so theres a little bit of trimming around the edges but really the net impression i would lead you on the card side is we continue to lean in now of course theres the marketing that we do just to originate accounts directly through all the direct marketing media we of course have our continued investments on the brand side the heavy spender investments which are particularly heavy in terms of marketing costs we continue to get very good traction on the spender side our growth as you sort of look at each sort of range of spenders we are getting the most growth at the higher end so that continues to be a good sign for us and so were leaning into that and then the other thing on the marketing side of course is the national bank marketing youve seen some of the success were having there everybody in banking is sort of leaning into the deposit growth side in the context of changing interest rates and some deposits leading the banking systems so our marketing venues get very good traction there so pulling way up we continue to feel good about the marketing we like the traction that were getting and we have of course a very vigilant eye on the economic environment that were moving into jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator and our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good evening thanks for taking my question rich i wanted to follow up on your commentary around delinquency metrics at the current pace of normalization is it reasonable to expect that we could see dqs get back to prepandemic levels by the mid2023 timeframe and then from there does your outlook suggest that you expect delinquencies to flatten out or are you conservatively expecting dqs to drift higher and are prepared for some degree of modest worsening in credit that perhaps goes a bit beyond normalization capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well what we have said bill is there are lots of metrics to look at and i can even talk to you about a few some of the others were looking at as well but number one that we would point our investors to look at is delinquency and delinquency entries and individual delinquency flow rates have we see the normalization happening there as i mentioned earlier and we think there continues its interesting when you look at the delinquencies themselves and most of the credit metrics they continue to just keep on moving toward what were calling sort of normalization normalization of course is not any precise point but there are also a number of other things that we look at that i think show sort of the strength of where this thing is headed and one is on the vintage curves from new originations they continue to be pretty flat month after month theyre of course lagged by several months but pretty flat and when we compare individual segments to where they were back in the prepandemic period its pretty much on top of each other so that is a good sign we continue to look at our payment rates which continue to be elevated we like elevated payment rates that weve assumed theyre going to normalize part of the way down to where they were before but of course theres been some mix shift towards more spender within capital ones portfolio but payment rates continue to be strong the percent of customers making just the minimum payment is still below prepandemic levels the percent of customers making full payments is above prepandemic levels revolve rate is roughly flat relative to last year and remains below prepandemic so these are all things that are positive indicators but i do want to say also again theres been some mix change in our own portfolio with a bit of a shift toward the heavier spenders so many of these metrics may not fully get back to where they were prepandemic but if we pull up on this what we see is nothing we see is surprising it would be consistent with a consumer coming off of some of the extreme stimulus and some of the extreme pullbacks in the pandemic and returning to more normal behavior and i think the delinquency metrics are certainly leading indicators of that trajectory bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful rich thank you if i may as a followup separate topic can you give us an update on capital ones strategy for reducing friction at checkout with different electronic consumer wallet solutions there have been some recent press reports regarding partnerships with other digital wallet providers itd be helpful if you could just share your latest thoughts jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp before you go bill were getting a lot of background noise bill could you go on mute bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc oh yeah i have yes i will richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 so a phrase that ive often used is the tip of the spear in the transformation of banking is payments both on the consumer and the commercial side and the reason i say this is that first of all its very prone to significant changes in technology and also its not as heavily regulated a space as much of banking is you dont have to be a bank holding company to be doing a lot of those things and thats actually the area that we have seen certainly a lot of traction in by some very successful tech company so capital one has we continue to support the various technology players who have developed payment innovations and we continue to develop innovations of our own there was some news out about in the news today in fact about potentially a new wallet coming out we are one of seven coowners of ews and were one of the thousands of banks that use ews but on that one we really dont have any specific comments to get ahead of the ews management team on that jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi rich i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your thoughts on auto credit and then as a followup what youre seeing on credit card spend in particular heavy spenders and whether or not they can sustain the for travel and spend numbers richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thank you don in auto lets talk a little bit about the auto business and maybe a little bit of a comparison to the card business just to talk about auto has many of the very same trends it has all the same general trends going on with the consumer and the normalization that we have been talking about the auto business also has some other things that are unique to it auto recoveries for example auto recoveries inventories are unusually low because of the very low chargeoffs that weve had in the past few years the past chargeoffs are basically the raw material for future recoveries so the generally good news that has been in the auto industry of robust used car prices actually puts upward pressure on our overall loss rate as recoveries inventory build so we also in terms of the credit metrics we have seen more degradation in the very very low and mostly below where we play in the auto business but we have trimmed a little bit around the edges at our own low end but basically we continue to feel very good about our originations from a credit point of view the biggest issue in auto is the margin pressure that has come from the rising interest rates that have not been fully passed through by the competition so we continue to feel really good about the auto opportunity but our pullback is really not a creditdriven pullback so much as it is a margindriven pullback but we certainly do see the we can see the normalization in the auto business capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then on the credit card spend samestore are you seeing moderation and can you talk about heavy spender trends richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah we youll notice our own spend growth numbers moderated quite a bit this quarter we are seeing spend per account per customer moderate across our portfolio moderating the most at the lower end but we see the moderation we see it the least in the very heaviest spenders but the moderation that you see in our spend growth metrics are driven really by whats happening per account we continue to get nice growth of accounts so that is a phenomenon that and then we kind of asked well what should we be rooting for i think youre seeing a very rational response by consumers to the environment there was a big surge in spending i think its moderating somewhat particularly at places other than the very highest end of the marketplace so i think its basically a sign of consumers being rational jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you andrew first question for you on share repurchases maybe you could just help us think about the pace of share repurchases as we move forward because i know you guys slowed them down but youve been building capital maybe you could just help us with that first andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure sanjay in terms of thinking about the capital that we have moved down over the course of the last couple of years from in the to we hit a low point of a couple quarters ago but as we sit here today were just looking at the actual and forecasted levels and the earnings and growth and in particular economic conditions and theres some pretty wide error bars around those factors particularly with respect to growth and economic uncertainty and so we feel like at this moment in time that its good to be a little bit more on the conservative side with risk management of managing that capital but clearly we have the flexibility around our capital decisions under scbs and so i dont know rich if you wanted to make any comments about repurchases as well richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah well we i think we just continue to generate a lot of capital and we a central part of our strategy is the return of capital through share repurchases and dividends lately weve dialed back a little bit on that just really as a measure of prudence in an unusually uncertain time like this i think theres ive never met anyone who sort of says that they had too much capital in a downturn so after very strong levels of buybacks weve moderated capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 here in this environment but the strategy of capital one continues to be the same and we believe that return of capital is an important part of the economic equation for investors over time sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so should we assume sort of the fourth quarter pace as a good run rate or just not assume anybody andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah sanjay were just going to manage it dynamically based on what we see in the marketplace and the factors that i described before so at this point youve seen what weve been doing over the last handful of months roughly million a month but again we have flexibility and as we have a bit more certainty of how the coming quarters will play out thats going to inform our actions operator thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from the line of arren cyganovich with citi arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks maybe you could just talk a little bit about the level of marketing growth for the year you had a bit of a step up id say in and the growth rates there are obviously showing a lot of traction in most of your metrics is there essentially kind of a bit of a slowdown but still have the ability to continue to grow and get into the opportunity on the card side richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah arren yeah marketing the marketing story has several components to it one is just the and an important part of that is the sort of realtime response to the opportunities that we see and we continue and especially talking about card and of course card is where most of the marketing is but we continue to see attractive growth opportunities really across our business and are leaning into them so that and its corresponded with some expansion in opportunities that are just a byproduct of our tech transformation and its just more access points more channels more better credit models that give a little bit deeper and wider access to opportunities and more granularity the more granularity that we get from our models actually the more we can separate the attractive customers from the less attractive and it allows us to lean in more so the marketing the pursuit of the realtime opportunities we see is an important part of the marketing and that is going very well the second important driver of course is the continued traction were getting in our really 10year journey to drive more and more upmarket with focus on heavy spenders and i think back to when we launched the venture card in and but of course this journey and weve been declaring for years that the pursuit of the top of the market is not something that is an opportunistic one of in and out and it is much more about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and then investing to be able to do that and thats capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 about great products with heavy reward content great servicing exceptional digital experiences but also more and more of the experiences that are consistent with the very highend lifestyle and so on so there have been a bunch of investments there most of that not all of it but a lot of that shows up in marketing that also has a significant upfront component in terms of not only the direct marketing and the brand building but also the early spend bonuses that go right through the marketing line when we at the early stage of these accounts so thats something that weve been growing and sustaining over the last number of years we love the traction that were getting and so we continue to lean into that and then again the national bank where i just want to comment i we are really pleased with the national bank that weve built this is a we are the really only kind of fullservice national bank that is not doesnt have a national quest to through acquisition to continue to grow in other words of all the banks our size or even smaller the realistic path to growth is to do that through mergers and acquisitions our path is an organic one weve invested quite a bit to create full digital capabilities for almost everything you can do in a branch to be able to be done by a customer digitally and so that our growth story is not just about savings accounts but its very much about checking accounts as well and this is our quest weve been on for some number of years to build a national bank that also is thats physical distribution light and marketing heavy so a bunch of things kind of come together to create the pretty big marketing levels that we have now but we feel very good about the traction that were getting arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc very helpful thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from the line of richard shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question andrew youve made the comment talking about the reserve rate on the card portfolio and reflecting the seasonality of the increase in spend and balances from spenddriven accounts as we move into q1 should we assume that with normal portfolio runoff but a mix shift that that allowance coverage ratio will actually pick up then because youre going to get a mix shift andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well theres a number of factors rick that will play into coverage ratio so why dont i just pull up and lay out the key pieces and forecast assumptions of our allowance and i will get to your kind of seasonal balance point in a moment but i think its important to lay out all of the component parts rather than just talk about one individual one since all of them will affect where coverage goes from here so the first part of the allowance is were using models to estimate the next months of losses and the early period of this forecast is generally more accurate because as rich was talking about earlier we can look at the existing delinquency inventories and flow rates beyond those months we incorporate in the economic capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 assumptions they become a more significant driver of expected loss content i referenced that in the answer to the first question that was asked on the call but the error bars around the loss content widened the further we go out over the course of the year the second factor impacting the allowances we start from the year one exit rate for losses and then assume a reversion to a longterm average over the following months and then the third thing is we net forecasted recoveries against the loss estimates for all of those periods and so on top of all of those assumptions we then put qualitative factors in places where we believe modeled outcomes have limitations and so we end up putting all of those pieces together to evaluate the allowance the openended product of credit card is different than closedend loans as we go through those mechanics because with closedend loans were reserving for estimated loss content for the account but in a revolving product like card were only able to reserve for the loss content related to the balances that are on the books at the end of the quarter as opposed to the projected loss content for the account so getting to your question then when we have elevated seasonal balances in the fourth quarter we expect a portion of those balances to pay down very quickly and therefore those specific balances are likely to have very very low loss content given the life of the balance is far shorter than the life of the account so all else equal the coverage ratio in the fourth quarter has a bit of natural downward pressure from that elevated denominator as you suggest but looking ahead theres a bunch of factors that can impact where the allowance goes from here beyond that single effect in periods where future losses may increase we would replace the low loss content of the current quarter with the projected higher loss content in a future period and for what its worth those assumptions also then carry into that reversion period as we have growth with seasonally adjusted balances rich mentioned this before cecl significantly pulls forward that allowance cost of growth and then the third factor is coming out of a period where we have unusually low losses like weve experienced over the last couple of quarters you have lower recoveries to offset the forecasted loss content so all of those things can put upward pressure on allowance but we can also have revisions to our economic assumptions to delinquency flow rates to just our overall loss content and so theres pressures in the other direction and so i appreciate your bearing with me for a longwinded complex answer but i think we all saw the complexity and procyclicality of cecl play out during the pandemic when we had to make a bunch of assumptions as the pandemic played out we built a sizable allowance only to release virtually all of it over the subsequent quarters and so its just a very difficult thing to predict given all of the assumptions at play which is why we are trying to focus you on naco and having delinquencies as a leading edge indicator of naco because that is ultimately where the real economic cost is felt richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it no its a great answer and im glad to bear with you ill probably read it in the transcript about seven more times so thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and i was hoping to talk a little bit about marketing i mean rich you did mention that you were primarily in card and primarily in the upscale customer but could you just talk a little bit about number one what you might be doing kind of in nonprime and how we should think about whether that total marketing spend given what you see is likely to be higher in or not richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so moshe im glad you asked the question because i would not want the net impression to be i think what you were saying is that is our marketing primarily just in the upscale customer segment differentially relative to years ago weve certainly had a shift to the higher end in terms of our marketing the marketing is also so expensive at that end and then also the marketing at the higher end tends to in some sense lift the boats across the franchise so the marketing at the higher end is carrying a lot on its shoulders moshe but we do a lot of marketing in the mass market of the card business including in the higher end of the subprime segment of the market this is our strategy here is well it changes all the we tweak it around the edges all the time weve been doing this for pretty much through approaching three decades now at the lower end of the market and the marketing there is direct marketing stimulus response very informationbased and so the marketing machine that weve built which has been enhanced by technology here is definitely leaning into that opportunity and i do want to say that we continue to get good traction in the subprime and prime parts of the marketplace even as we certainly relative to years ago have a lot more marketing going on at the top of the market so theres quite a bit going on and we feel good about the traction there moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it maybe just to kind of as a followup what would it take for you to see either in the portfolio or in the market for you to do less marketing richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah the way this tends to happen is it happens in one little segment one micro segment at the margin in response to things that we see going on there i use this phrase a lot trimming around the edges and youve heard me use that for many many years and this is something that we always do or sometimes were expanding around the edges the net feel of these days is were doing more trimming around the edges than expanding around the edges but it is so its less about at the top of the house saying we just believe we should do obviously at the top of the house were looking at all the macro things but were linking what we see in the macro level to what were seeing right there in realtime or the earliest we can see from our credit metrics and then using the technology weve continued to invest so heavily in to have a more and more granular diagnosis and at an earlier time than ever before diagnosis of where anything is deviating from the trajectory that we would expect capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 and then one is sort of the diagnosis of deviation and the second thing of course is trying to get sort of a root cause understanding of what may be driving that and this is something that we continue to put a lot of energy into and it has led us to trim some there are some things that we have seen degrade a fair amount around the edges theyre fairly small in the overall size of things but were certainly glad when we see them and then what we try to do is to link data that we see to behavior that excuse me to sort of an explanation of whats going on from a customer and credit dynamic to be able to see if it makes total sense so therefore as things play out its less likely and lets say we go more into a downturn its less likely on the card side that you would see a big pullback the kind of things youd see as more trimming around the edges more reduction of the credit line that are given and that would be more how it would play out operator thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator and our final john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good evening on the regarding the reserve build in terms of the drivers of the reserve build this quarter i know you cited loan growth you cited the macro backdrop and you cited credit normalization is there any way to help parse out how much of the build of billion is attributable to loan growth versus macro versus credit normalization andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah john we dont break out those components in part because some of them are actually related to one another for instance how we think about qualitative factors and how we think about our base forecast is tied into one another and so thats why we just wanted to lay out that quarteroverquarter when you look at consensus estimates for things like unemployment looking ahead at from where we were as of the end of the third quarter to where we were at the end of the fourth quarter looking ahead on some of those metrics we saw a degree of worsening and when you couple that with shifting forward one quarter and replacing a much lower loss content in the fourth quarter with continued normalization as i referenced it heading into those are factors that go into it but i actually not even really able to break out the component parts because theyre tied with one another with all the assumptions john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay no i get it thats helpful the normalization point if i could just ask one more thing on that was there anything about the normalization and i appreciate the color you already gave but is there anything about the normalization that youre seeing that is kind of faster than expected or any change like that that necessitated the size of the build this quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp no and i think rich touched on some of these in one of his earlier responses but what were seeing in terms of normalization is playing out as we expect its part of why i wanted to highlight the fact that the mechanics of the reserve though only take into account that 12month model period and revert from there and so were only allowing for the content the outstanding content at the end of the quarter as well so even if things play out exactly as we expect we could see allowance build just like we saw this quarter it just depends on a whole host of factors jeff norris senior vice presidentinvestor relations capital one financial corp and i think that concludes our qa for the evening thank you for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your continuing interest in capital one
