begin by turning to the full year overview on slide we are very pleased with the companys financial and operating performance in it was another noteworthy year for peoples united as we acquired two banks and a specialty finance company enhanced our suite of banking technology and strengthened core capabilities as a result we continue to build the earnings power of the company while further solidifying its foundation to generate consistent and sustainable growth in the years ahead commitment to our strategy of balancing organic growth and thoughtful ma was evident during we began the year by acquiring var technology an innovative specialty finance company with an exclusive focus on the technology sector var has been successful integrated into leaf capital and transitioned from an originationfor sale model to an originationtohold model in april we closed the acquisition of bsb bancorp the holding company for belmont bank and completed the core conversion in july belmont has added to the momentum our franchise is generating in the greater boston area we are particularly pleased with the synergies provided by belmonts commercial real estate team which continues to generate strong production in november we also closed the acquisition of united financial bancorp the holding company for united bank the addition of united bolsters our already significant share of retail households and commercial clients across central connecticut and western massachusetts the integration is progressing well the core systems conversion will take place early in the second quarter and we are on track to realize projected cost saves our strong results this year are a testament to the efforts of our employees who successfully integrated var completed the core system conversion for belmont and advanced the integration of united while continuing to deliver organic growth and enhanced profitability this performance is further evidence that the integration of acquisitions is a significant core competency of peoples united throughout we made further investments in technology platforms as consumers continued to shift to digital channels we launched several mobile device and onlinedriven offerings this year including our most recent offering of a digital small business solution for loans or less looking ahead we remain committed to providing enhanced digital access as we aim to deliver an integrated service model that blends the best in customer service with digital solutions as such we will continue to partner with fintech companies to bring greater efficiency ease of use and scale to meet the evolving needs of our customers looking at the fullyear financial performance operating earnings increased from a year ago to million the highest in companys history in addition operating earnings of per common share grew for the 10th consecutive year these strong results generated an operating return on average tangible common equity of an increase of basis points compared to the prior year total revenues of billion increased yearoveryear driven by both organic growth and recent acquisitions this increase reflects improvement in both net interest income and net noninterest income net interest income of billion was up from or excluding united within our full year growth goal range of to as you will recall we updated our full year goals earlier this year to include belmont but did not incorporate united as the acquisitions had yet to close peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 despite the interest rate environment during the year and the easing of monetary policy by the federal reserve our full year net interest margin expanded basis points to excluding united the margin was which is within our to goal range noninterest income had a terrific year with and especially strong fourth quarter full year results of million increased or on an operating basis which far exceeded our to growth expectation this increase was driven by a variety of lines including a particularly high level of customer swap income operating noninterest income excluding united increased from an operating perspective total expenses of billion were up million from a year ago we are pleased with these results given the inclusion of united belmont and var into the franchise during the year and having farmington on the books for a full months excluding united operating expenses were billion well within our fullyear goal range of billion to billion as a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs while still making improvements and investments in the franchise we continue to enhance operating leverage as demonstrated by a basis point improvement from the prior year in the efficiency ratio to periodend loans and deposits increased and respectively from a year ago driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth excluding united and the transactional portion of our new york multifamily portfolio periodend loan balances were billion up from yearend right in the middle of our to growth expectations for the year in addition to the inclusion of belmont these results were driven by strong results in mortgage warehouse lending equipment finance and our specialized industry verticals within ci particularly partially offset by continued headwinds within commercial real estate and home equity periodend deposit balances excluding united were billion an increase of which was below our full year goal of to growth while we achieve meaningful growth in commercial deposits retail balances declined modestly from due to some managed runoff of higher cost deposits from belmont and standalone peoples united furthermore a managed decline in broker deposits also impacted the balances at yearend before looking ahead it is important to briefly reflect on the significant progress of our franchise over the last years we have almost tripled total assets to nearly billion increased full year operating earnings per share at an average annual rate of strengthened our presence in metro new york and greater boston deepened already strong positions within our heritage markets and expanded our national businesses at the same time we have remained true to our roots of delivering superior service at a local level maintaining exceptional asset quality and supporting our communities as we start a new decade already filled with economic and competitive uncertainties we are confident our long term approach to managing the business will enable us to generate value for customers and shareholders regardless of the operating environment with that background in mind let me outline our goals for the fullyear as listed on slide it is important to note the following goals incorporate a full year of belmont and united the first goal is to grow our core loan portfolio in the range of to on a periodend basis the core loan portfolio excludes the runoff of select united loan portfolios which ended with an aggregate balance of billion this balance is less than the approximately billion in runoff we referenced at the acquisitions announcement due to a subsequent decision peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 to sell million of these loans as such these balances are included the loans held for sale lines on the balance sheet we expect the runoff of the select united portfolios to be in the range of million to million for the full year core loans also excludes the transactional portion of our new york multifamily portfolio which is in runoff mode period end balances for this portfolio finished at million we expect the runoff in the transactional new york multifamily portfolio to be in the range of million to million for the full year after excluding these portfolios the balance at yearend for core loans was billion included in the to core loan growth is an assumption that residential mortgage balances will be unchanged from yearend as we continue to remix the balance sheet to focus on higher yielding portfolios secondly periodend deposit growth is anticipated to be in a range of to as we continue to focus on gathering core customer deposits while managing down higher cost portfolios the next goal is for net interest income to increase in the range of to embedded in this goal is the expectation for the net interest margin to be in the range of to this net interest margin range is derived from many different factors one of which is an assumption of no change in the fed funds rate during the year moving on to noninterest income as i mentioned earlier total noninterest income had we had a terrific year in including a very strong fourth quarter the results were driven by a variety of lines including some that have inherently lumpy results period to period our assumption is for a level of normalization to occur in as such we expect noninterest income on an operating basis to grow in the range of to from million in operating noninterest expenses which exclude mergerrelated costs are anticipated to be in the range of billion to billion as compared to the billion in as a reminder this range includes a full year of results from belmont and united it is also important to note the core system conversion for united is not expected until early in the second quarter we also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of million to million the higher provision level reflects expected loan growth and the impact of cecl in addition we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of to finally we plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at yearend holding company common equity tier capital ratio will be in the range of to this goal does not contemplate any share repurchases during the year as you will recall we positioned the buyback program announced in july as an opportunistic capital management tool as such any decision to repurchase shares will be subject to market conditions with that i will pass it to david to discuss the fourth quarter results r david rosato senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you jack we concluded with strong financial performance as demonstrated by another quarter of record earnings operating earnings of million increased linkedquarter and reflected the acquisition of united improved net interest margin and positive operating leverage it is important to note the fourth quarter included the following items which were deemed nonoperating mergerrelated costs of million pretax or million after tax an intangible asset writeoff of million pretax or million after tax related to the peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 liquidation of our public mutual funds a gain net of expenses of million pretax or million after tax related to the sale of eight branches in central maine the transaction closed in october and included approximately million in loans million in deposits and million of assets under management turning to slide net interest income of million increased million or from the third quarter the loan portfolio contributed million to the increase due to higher balances lower deposit and borrowing costs benefited net interest income by million and million respectively in addition higher balances in the securities portfolio added million overall the inclusion of united added approximately million to net interest income for the quarter as displayed on slide net interest margin of expanded basis points linkedquarter the margin benefited from continued disciplined management of deposit costs remixing of the loan portfolio and the net effect of purchase accounting adjustments related to the united transaction excluding these purchase accounting adjustments the margin was or basis points less than the third quarter lower borrowing costs favorably impacted net interest margin by basis points while lower loan yields reduced the margin by basis points turning to loans on slide average balances of billion increased by billion or from the third quarter driven primarily by the addition of united on an organic basis average balances increased million or less than periodend balances of billion increased billion linkedquarter but were essentially flat excluding united organic commercial loan growth of million was driven by solid results in commercial real estate equipment finance and ci partially offset by seasonally lower mortgage warehouse lending balances the increase in commercial loans was offset by a million decline in retail loans mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios commercial real estate organic growth was driven primarily by strong performance in northern new england particularly in massachusetts all three of our equipment finance businesses grew balances during the quarter with leaf once again generating excellent production ci continues to benefit from our specialized industry verticals with especially good results in fund banking healthcare and franchise lending during the quarter moving on to deposits on slide average balances of billion increased billion or from the third quarter while periodend balances of billion were up billion or the higher balances were driven by the inclusion of united excluding the acquisition average and periodend balances decreased million and million respectively or less than on each basis while we achieved solid growth in commercial deposits retail balances declined modestly due to some managed writeoff of higher cost deposits in addition a managed reduction in brokered deposits also impacted balances we remained focused on controlling pricing as evidenced by a 13basis point reduction in deposit cost during the quarter similar to the third quarter we remain disciplined in managing costs across the franchise looking to slide weve continued to achieve strong noninterest income with million in the fourth quarter this result marks an increase of million or on a linkedquarter basis operating noninterest income which excludes the million gain net of expenses from the sale of eight central main branches was million up million or from the third quarter the inclusion of united added approximately million to noninterest income in the quarter by noninterest income category the million linkedquarter increase was primarily driven by million and higher customer interest rate swap income a million increase in bank service charges primarily attributable peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 to the addition of united million in higher commercial banking fees and a million increase in other non interest income this increase was driven by several items including a million gain on the sale leaseback of our office building in burlington vermont and a million benefit to noninterest income from the markto market of one equity security position these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in insurance revenues reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals and a decline in investment management fees which was partially related to the million of asset under management sold as part of the central maine branch sale on slide noninterest expense of million increased million linkedquarter included in the fourth quarter were million of nonoperating costs in the following categories million in other expenses million in compensation and benefits million in professional and outside services and the remaining in occupancy and equipment in comparison the third quarter incurred million of nonoperating costs excluding nonoperating costs noninterest expense of million was up million or linkedquarter this increase was driven by the inclusion of united which added approximately million to operating non interest expense in the quarter by expense category the million linkedquarter increase was mostly due to million in higher occupancy and equipment expenses a million increase in compensation and benefits an additional million in professional and outside service costs and a million increase in regulatory assessments this variance was due to a lower third quarter assessment resulting from an fdic credit the largest driver offsetting these increases was million in lower other expenses as a reminder third quarter other expenses were unfavorably impacted by certain legal and other onetime operational costs turning to slide the efficiency ratio of improved basis points from the third quarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting well controlled expenses and higher revenues asset quality was once again exceptional across each of our portfolios as demonstrated on slide originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and reo at basis points is a 1basis point improvement from the third quarter and below our peer group and top banks net chargeoffs of basis points were unchanged from q3 and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets briefly on slides and return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity declined basis points and basis points respectively from the third quarter on an operating basis both metrics improved operating return on average assets was up basis points to basis points while operating return on average tangible common equity increased basis points to finally capital ratios remain strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management this concludes our prepared remarks well be happy to answer any questions you may have operator were ready for questions peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we are ready to open the lines up for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies hey guys good afternoon john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi mark r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey mark mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies first question i had is just to clarify a comment jack you made about the loan balances so if we take the year end loan balances of call it billion and that grows sort of to and did i hear correctly that youre going to see runoff of million to million on the united portfolio this year and another million to million from new york multifamily runoff john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yes thats correct mark mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies so if loans you split the difference on the growth to say its a billion less somewhere between million and million of loan growth or runoff i should say okay john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc the loan growth excludes the runoff r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc correct so if you take the ending total loans of million reduce the billion of united and the multifamily book of million brings you down to million so thats the base that the loan growth is off of then additionally we expect those two portfolios to runoff between million and million each during the year peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies got you okay and then secondly can you help us think about the purchase accounting impact on the margin over the next maybe quarter or two r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah so we called out mark the basis points in q4 that is a good number the way i think about kind of two components obviously the loan side and the deposit side the loan purchase accounting will be with us for about four years on the deposit side most of that mark is around the cd portfolio which is about a year so youre going to see a first half benefit larger than the second half but the second half will be a run rate for a couple of years mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then the million writeoff for intangible asset what is the asset that the writeoff is on i didnt see it in the release anywhere r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so that was the value that we attributed to the mutual fund business at acquisition of gerstein fisher mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then lastly jack i wondered if you could comment on your outlook for ma in the northeast and has your view on bigger deals changed in light of how the market has received so well some of these larger transactions john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so i really dont see the pace of ma generally changing dramatically one way or the other in the northeast i would say at this point and in terms of appetite for larger deals i mean weve been willing to consider larger deals if appropriate the right fix et cetera so again i dont think our view has changed theres not many larger deals across our footprint i will say that if you look at our footprint and whats out there mark thomas fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler companies thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc actually i had a similar question line of thought here can you just give us the base that youre using for both the nii and the fees that youre growing off of i just want to make sure were on the same page john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc well starting with fees the basis the million that we referenced the base for the nii is just what is in the press release which is billion ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay perfect thats helpful and then obviously your cet1 target the to of not including buybacks can you just talk about how aggressive you might potentially be with buybacks i mean could you get down to im trying to think of how to think about layering in buybacks on top of that base number john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so ken what i would say is when we announced the buyback and then in the call on the third quarter and today for the third time weve used the term opportunistic the to is the consistent capital level that we put out as a goal for last year as well we manage within that last year and our intention would be to manage within this year as well ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so i guess given zero buybacks this whole year then when you say opportunistic it would not be a crazy assumption to assume zero buybacks next year as well thats one possibility is that correct john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc well there is a full range of possibilities from no buybacks to the full completion of the based on our views of the equity markets and obviously our stock in particular ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay understood thank you very much john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 operator thank you our next question comes from casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc how you doing john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc okay casey haire q analyst jefferies llc wanted to touch on the on the loan growth so that the to which buckets are going to be driving that and it sounds like you guys are still happy to run down resi mortgage like what sort of headwind should we expect from resi mortgage in john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so this is jack casey as we said in the script were expecting resi to basically stay flat yearendtoyearend theres actually a lot of activity in there as you can imagine given amortization and payoffs so one of the things that i guess i hope is clear to everybody were very committed to resi mortgage in terms of delivering the products to our customer base its important part of the retail part of our bank so there are some wholesale channels where we can do less and as weve been saying our focus is trying to remix gradually so that were booking more higher yield portfolios and a softening if you will the percentage of reducing the percentage of residential mortgages overall on the balance sheet so thats where the resi is ill ask jeff tengel to talk about the loan growth and the other business lines jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yeah in the commercial business we think its going to be very similar to what we experienced this year were not expecting a lot of growth if any in our commercial real estate portfolio for all of the reasons weve talked about in the past and so across the rest of our franchise our core middle market business particularly in our larger markets like connecticut and massachusetts have had growth in and we think that will continue in weve seen a lot of good growth across the number of the industry specialization businesses that david referenced we think that momentum will continue into and our equipment finance businesses also had peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 good growth in and we expect that to continue in so we feel really good about all of those commercial businesses and think that the pipelines are in pretty good shape and feel pretty confident going into the year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great okay r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey casey just to put a number around our thinking about resi mortgages if you go back to like june of so before the last three acquisitions we had about of the loan book in resi mortgages at june of it was up to almost and so were just trying to bring that number down a few percentage points without selling anything out of it to do it on a natural basis and thatll obviously bring up the commercial side which yields more casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood got it okay and then just switching to the reserve side of things with a lot of moving parts here but just given all the ups and downs within the loan portfolio but as we think about cecl and your adoption of it what do you see the go forward provision rate the loan loss reserve ratio settling out as you adopt cecl r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well so we gave a provision guidance of million to million said that was inclusive of united so thats million to125 million a quarter is the way were thinking about it and you should as well casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay all right okay ill leave it there thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thanks casey operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good evening r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 hey just a couple questions i guess on the margin so i hear you with the lower accretion as we go into the second half of the year but are you with the focus on the higher yielding loans as the area of growth i guess where are you seeing more of that incremental pressure on the margin is it repricing of the loan portfolio or is there really just not much more room to move on the deposit side r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc i would say its a little bit of both so we had three quick fed moves in kind of a compressed period of time in the third and fourth quarter i would say by the time the quarter was over the loan portfolio had kind of repriced any lags in there had kind of come down remember about at this point of our loan portfolio is really one month libor driven and one month libor and down basis points i think it was in q4 we telegraphed our guidance around steady interest rates steady fed funds rate so i think as the fixed piece of the portfolio grows youll see some downward pressure there i think if the fed does not do anything all year it will be harder to bring down deposit pricings therell be some positive role in our cd books and the other piece of that is were seeing good restrain across the industry on deposit pricing so i just think in a steadier environment the ability to make moves will be a little bit muted jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then on the securities portfolio i know united had some clos were those completely gone by the end of the year and as a secondary part of that what i guess drove that 5basispoint growth in the securities portfolio is that a purchase effort on your part or is that more just some marktomarket on the portfolio that was acquired r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc no so they did have a clo portfolio that portfolio never hit our books meaning it was gone before we acquired them we did exactly like we said we would when we announced the deal all those securities were liquidated all that came over from their portfolio was a little over million of securities that we would say are very much like the stuff that we own within the quarter you saw i believe a 5basispoint improvement in the yield on the securities portfolio driven by the addition of some municipal bonds which in that portfolio as well as really good low levels of prepayment activity across the mortgagebacked so the amount of amortization that went through the portfolio was really well controlled in the fourth quarter resulting in a higher yield jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks just finally for me with the branches that were sold up in maine in a more compact branch footprint now i guess in southern new england are there areas where you could actually see or we could see the bank do some de novo expansion whether its south shore mass or more infill in the boston area or would any future footprint expansion really be driven by ma john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc jared this is jack i would peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey jack john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc say we just opened de novo branch in the seaport area in boston and we certainly would consider looking at other opportunities there that branch by the way is really off to a great start and we also did penn station in new york and again were encouraged by that its off to a great start theres a lot of activity there so we definitely are open to de novo love to build out the south shore boston and kind of considering and looking at our options there and so were open to it we actually are also closing continue to close branches so kind of working to optimize the branch footprint all the time jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc just a first followup on nim whats the assumed purchase accounting accretion benefit thats in the guidance is that around basis points r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah just slightly below that for the full year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then quite a few moving parts of the loan growth guidance what are the expectations for reported total loans not making any adjustments where do you see total loan balances moving in peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well it really is off its that growth off that base that we gave that base john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so thats to loan growth r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc but weve excluded some runoffs in that indiscernible r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah im sorry i gave the wrong number off the base of steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right i guess im trying to figure out when the companys position does start showing total loan growth thats more material ex of these runoff items doesnt sound like its john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc i mean i think one thing its when the commercial real estate market however you want to describe it its clearly frothy and it hits us in many different ways its our largest portfolio so we did what was it jeff a little over billion in originations in and were basically flat so were active in the business were taking care of our customers but were getting payoffs from shadow banking companies were getting sale of properties so its hard to predict steve when that changes other than some kind of a change in my mind and change in the like a cycle change for us or so maybe a change in rate environments where that changes the dynamics and thats why i think when jeff kind of referred to whether its middle market business banking the leasing companies the verticals were actually doing quite well in a lot of our businesses and moving ourselves forward but thats challenge steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then thanks and then finally on expenses for the guidance you guys still assuming phasein of ubnk cost saves in is that still the assumption john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah yeah no change peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then the expense picture has been a little bit muddled because of all the deals dave how do you think about just organic expense growth for the franchise ex any acquisitions r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i think about that at about a rate and i know every year theres been ma activity in there but thats really what it works out to be steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay thanks taking my questions r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good evening everyone r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just a few sort of housekeeping items david what was the balance in the mortgage warehouse portfolio this quarter r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc it was a john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc kind of billion peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc billion collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and is your expectation for that in i mean for balances to drop as youre kind of thinking about the book in total the total loan book that you could see balances drop in for that line r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yes a small amount i mean they came off a little bit in q4 about million or so we expect a little bit of decline next year subject once again i mean the mortgage book was completely different than we thought at the beginning of the year subject to level of interest rates and refi activity collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then on the loans that you have in the heldforsale the resi mortgages that you guys are selling whats the blended yield on those r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well so just to be clear the billion that you see that showed up on the loans held for sale are united bank portfolios that subsequent to the deal we decided to sell and that work is in process collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so does that mean you cant offer what the yield was on those loans r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah yeah wed rather not collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay okay and then just going back to the dynamics of the nim so david you know i understand youre saying that if were in a steady rate environment theres probably less movement to see here but can you just talk a little bit about what youre doing with your deposit offering rates right now and then is there would there be a catalyst that putting rate aside that would cause you to kind of drop your deposit rates again just trying to think about the flowthrough of potentially lower funding going forward r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure the so i would say number one i would stress that in the since the fed started moving down since the end of july weve been very disciplined around deposit pricing across all of our businesses but weve also would peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 say that the industry has been well disciplined as well which is important because when you have one or two players who arent its difficult so for example today our best cd offer out there is a sixmonth cd at times right so slightly below the top end of the feds target range the other thing that we did on the retail side is become less aggressive on money market promotions so those offer rates are lower relative to where fed funds target is and thats been another dynamic in the last six months i dont see those type of that type of behavior changing in at least in the near term so i just i think if thats day to day our frontline folks being in front of customers trying to generate growth in new accounts and serving our customers but were able to do it in a slightly less promo environment john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc the other thing i would add collyn is that were really pleased with the work that our relationship managers have done going out proactively and having the conversation with customers about the fed raise rates and we raised deposit pricing now the fed has lowered rates and we need to lower pricing and because of relationships and good communication we feel really good that weve had nice success collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful and i guess along those lines if we think about recognizing obviously the incremental growth in the portfolio is going to be fairly low but just the margin on the new business thats coming on in the wake of well yes we saw the curve steepen it so obviously very narrow but are you kind of structurally seeing kind of a nim benefit longer term that the incremental spread that youre putting on your balance sheet is more than that or is it less r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc what i would say actually collyn a little bit the other way so last quarter we referenced that that differential came down from about basis points in the second quarter to about basis points in the third that has moved down a bit in the fourth quarter subject to mix and shape of the yield curve i think thats going that dynamic will slowly come in not expand collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then okay r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc indiscernible collyn just to finish that thought so theres two components to that right theres interest rate benchmark interest rates and credit spreads and what i would say is the driver is benchmark interest rates our credit spreads have been pretty steady in the back half of last year and we dont expect that to change collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 okay okay all right thats helpful and then the decision around selling the mutual fund some of the mutual funds can you just walk through that or is that like specifically tied to the bridges or just trying to understand what you guys were doing there r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well we did not sell the mutual funds so we they were public mutual funds its a little over million we that were in gerstein fisher we just stopped using public mutual funds as the vehicle for those customers to invest were still managing that money we just are doing it back in what we call our managed account group so same customers same investment strategies just not in a public mutual fund format where we have higher costs to serve those customers collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful okay and then just as we think about the initial accretion targets for ubnk i think it was like a share that you guys are looking for for eps accretion how do you sort of see that folding in because i think if we align what some of the targets are well let me just ask that question how do you see that folding in r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so that which was on a fully phasedin cost basis right so and as jack referenced the conversion will be done in early in the second quarter and then theres a little bit of time before we get everything out all the cost out and get to the permanent if you will run rate so everything around that transaction from purchase accounting accretion is all on target so no change in our expectations the only change really is the rather than running off billion of loans we decided to take that billion and sell them so that means that billion of assets will be gone sooner than we originally thought but its actually not going to be material to the financial projections that we gave collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so that doesnt change that okay okay thats helpful all right i will leave it there thanks guys r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thanks collyn operator thank you our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 good evening everybody john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc good evening matt r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi matt matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co hey just wanted to confront quick on cecl the initial reserve guidance increase million to million does that still hold and is that should we expect a similar impact to capital r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so thats just for everyones benefit thats what we referenced on the third quarter call as a reminder that did not include united bank our work around cecl continues we now think that well actually be just around the lower end of that number when all is said and done so plus or minus million and then there will be some additional to united but that work is still in progress as well matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co could you give us some sort of a range perhaps is it significantly less or more than the million just for ballpark purposes r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc just for united matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co yes r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc its below that matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co okay okay and then considering once we true it up considering the moving parts youll be running off some of the ubnk you are mix shifting more towards commercial the overall reserve level relative to loans then increasing or decreasing number peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc i think its about the same the credit discipline of the company is unchanged the changing nature or complexion of the credit risk on the balance sheet is not significantly different from where we have been historically matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co okay so despite the mix shift it will stay flat understood r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co your securities portfolios just going back to jareds question i just want to confirm because prior commentary was that you would sell roughly million should we expect the billion securities portfolio should we expect that to hold flat through is that a good modeling estimate r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah thats fine as i said everything we said we would sell out of united we did and actually some of it was as i referenced on the clos they actually did it prior to acquisition and so today the securities portfolio is about of total assets weve been there for a while thats less than some years we are running but where the level of interest rate is pretty modest steepness of the yield curve were pretty much going to keep things where they are as we see it today matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co understood okay and then my last one just concerning your actions on the branch network your comments on taking a look at the physical branch network could you just remind us of the stopandshop supermarket branches how many are there how are they performing are they performing up to expectations if theres a contract associated with them when is that up for renewal just wanted to get a sense for as you consider the branch network whether or not the supermarket branches are part of the longterm story r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure ill give you a couple of numbers and then if jack wants to make any other comments so today or at year end we had about we have branches across the franchise the stopandshops across new york and connecticut are about of the branches they are a critical part today and have been of our branch network theyre a lowcost delivery source for us and then the contract that weve talked about before is up in about two years we also own an option to extend that if we want john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 so i would say just to add that were working with stopandshop to look to the future and kind of if you will the model that were using and were having some very constructive conversations about that so well have to just work our way through that period and determine where we go matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co understood okay and then just my last one tickytacky really just concerning loan yield quarteroverquarter the equipment financing bucket only decreased basis points i was a little surprised by the movement there could you just give us a reminder of the typical equipment finance loan structure variable floating versus fixed and how much leaf with the higher yielding component played into what was relatively a small move in that bucket john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so i will interpret your question as you were pleasantly surprised by the performance the leaf is the highest yielding portfolio of the three so everything across our three equipment platforms is fixed rate production right unlike our mortgage warehouse or abl which is one month libor these are our fixed rate cash flows for a predominant amount of our fixed rate cash flows and spreads and yield spreads dont change that often and theyre not the business especially in leaf and puefc the old former fin fed are its a ratedriven business and they dont move that often so thats how that yield even in a down basis point fed funds environment holds up the largest of our three platforms pclc is lower yielding and more market sensitive but that is the business that we have held flat from an outstandings perspective for the last three years or so and then dont forget this was the year that at the beginning of the year we bought var technologies and we brought them into the fold and theyre really nice high yield originator as well matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co understood could you give us an idea what the leaf yield is and thats my last question john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc sure so that yield just on a coupon yield ignoring a nice fee income is yields from call it to about matthew m breese q analyst piper jaffray co great thats all i had thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thanks matt peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 operator thank you and our next question will come from david bishop with da davidson

you remind us r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc we really have only bought a de minimis amount of shares back so essentially zero david jason bishop q analyst d a davidson co got it and then from a purchase accounting accretion impact this quarter do you have that from a dollar amount perspective what that benefit was in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc fourth quarter pertaining to united it was about million david jason bishop q analyst d a davidson co and then the core legacy purchase accounting interest income from belmont and others r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc those numbers have gotten quite a bit smaller at this point david we have to come back and give you the details on that we can take that offline i cant
