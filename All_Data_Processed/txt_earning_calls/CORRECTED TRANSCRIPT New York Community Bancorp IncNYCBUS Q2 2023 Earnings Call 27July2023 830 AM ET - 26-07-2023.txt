robert cangemi president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you sal good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today i would like to begin by briefly summarizing the strong operating results we achieved during the second quarter early this morning we reported record net income earnings per share fueled in large part by the benefits from our two recent acquisitions of flagstar bank and signature this is our first quarter with all three legacy franchises combined under one umbrella not only are we benefiting financially from our combinations we are continuing to benefit from the power of diversification in both our loan portfolio and our deposit composition i believe that our operating performance is only just beginning to show the true underlying core earnings power of our combined organization from an earnings and net income perspective diluted earnings per share as adjusted for million bargain purchase gain and other merger related items we reported a record per share our net income available to common stockholders totaled a record of million more than double what we reported during the first quarter operating results were driven by a full quarter benefit from the signature transaction as opposed to only business days last quarter and a significantly higher net interest margin our nim expanded by basis points to on a linkedquarter basis driven by higher interestearning assets specifically cash and stronger yields on our loan portfolio as our asset sensitivity balance sheet continues to benefit from the higher interest rate environment our net interest margin should remain elevated over the course of the year given our diversified loan portfolio which is mostly variable rate and our increasing core deposits funding liability banks new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 our funding composition continues to improve as core deposits increased while cds both retail and brokered declined also wholesale borrowings declined as we used a portion of our cash balances to pay down billion of federal home loan bank advances over time i believe this change in our funding mix will be an advantage and support higher multiple expansion in the goforward periods in addition another positive was our capital our capital ratios trended higher while tangible book value per share increased compared to the prior quarter and yearoveryear our tangible capital generation remains very strong given our earnings power aside from our strong quarterly results last week we announced the expansion of our private banking businesses which we added as part of the signature bank transaction by hiring from the former first republic bank these initiatives are highly regarded and the fact that they chose to join the new flagstar is a testament to our business model and strong reputation in the marketplace with these hires we have a total of teams as of june including in the northeast and on the west coast and we now operate in cities these teams are part of a broader strategy to create a premier private banking division dedicated delivering best inclass service to a personalized single point of contact model were excited that these can partner with us and look forward to achieving great things together moving on to our balance sheet total loans were up modestly during the second quarter reflecting our diversification efforts as growth in the ci portfolio offset declines in other lending verticals overall total loans and leases were billion up about million or compared to the previous quarter primarily driven by growth in the ci book which benefited by continued growth in the mortgage warehouse business at june total commercial loans represented of total loans and leases as for asset quality the metrics remained strong and despite and also best in the industry despite an uptick in npls off of historical low levels in legacy nycb npas totaled million or basis points compared to million or basis points last quarter the increase resulted largely from the inclusion of acquired loans from both of our acquisitions despite this uptick npas and total assets ranked in the top quartile compared to industry peers reflecting our disciplined underwriting and client selection furthermore the allowance for credit losses increased million to million compared to the previous quarter and coverage was of nonperforming loans and basis points of total loans importantly this was another quarter of low or no loan losses as we recorded a net recovery of million compared to zero net chargeoffs last quarter another positive was our deposit base total deposits increased billion or annualized on a linked quarter basis to billion as the increase in noninterest bearing deposits more than offset the decline in other categories including higher cost cds and deposits related to the loan portfolios we did not acquire from signature including in noninterest bearing deposits are approximately billion of custodial deposits related to signature transaction excluding these deposits noninterest bearing deposits now represent of total deposits compared to last quarter coming off the march events our deposit base remains increasingly resilient this is due in large part to the diversity of the distribution channels which in addition to our retail branch network includes commercial and private client groups digital and bankingasaservice and deposits derived through the mortgage ecosystem deposits at legacy signature declined billion on a linkedquarter basis excluding custodial accounts this was primarily due to a planned runoff in higher cost cds and broker deposits offset by million quarterover quarter growth in noninterest bearing demand deposits in addition to the stabilization in the deposit base legacy signature pcg teams have also stabilized and we expect to grow from these levels as for guidance given the current economic and interest rate environment we currently expect the nim in the range of to mortgage gain on sale between million to million net return on msr assets new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 between to loan admin income of approximately million and annual expenses ranging between billion to billion excluding mergerrelated expenses and intangible amortization as well as a full year tax rate in terms of expenses total opex were million up million or on a linkedquarter basis second quarter operating expenses include a full quarter of signature expenses compared to only days during the first quarter finally id like to say a special thank you to all of our teammates which now number nearly strong our results would not be possible without the dedication and commitment to our clients and our customers with that we will be happy to answer any questions you may have well do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or this week operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin with the questionandanswer session operator instructions please wait for a moment while we compile the qa roster the first question comes from brody preston with ubs please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i was hoping that you would talk a little bit about the duration of those custodial noninterest bearing deposits youve kind of carved in out separately and it seems like theyre related to the servicing maybe of the fdic the loans youre servicing for the fdic how long would those stick around and i guess in conjunction with that how long would the loan administration income from the subservicing or the loan administration income from the subservicing of those loans stick around as well at that million level thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure so brody ill give it ill pass it over to john pinto but its in our guidance so john why dont you just speak specifically to this issue john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so well start quickly because its in the guidance with the loan admin income so this is the cost recovery of servicing the loans that we did not take as part of the signature transaction so if we look back at what those words the cre book and its the fund banking loans the fund banking loans have paid off pretty significantly in new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 the quarter so thats why weve seen a larger number in this in that loan servicing income number in the loan admin income number for this quarter than what were guiding in q3 we expect those loans to continue to pay down and its really those paydowns that we saw throughout the second quarter that built up the custodial deposits that we had throughout the quarter so both issues are intertwined in that the receivership loans as theyre paying down were collecting those funds for the fdic and then on a monthly basis we are remitting that back to them so we will see lower fdic or custodial deposits related to signature as the loan portfolios shrink and over time depending on the disposition of those quarters which we expect to be for fund we expect the sale probably to be in the early fourth quarter we will start to see those numbers drop as we go forward brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that excluding the billion you still had some solid noninterest bearing deposit growth i think ph you called million but that was related to signature and so tom maybe you could give us an update in terms of how the work is progressing to kind of bring back those signature noninterest bearing deposits that left before the acquisition thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well the good news is that the teams are stable like we discussed in the opening remarks but more importantly were building the team so we think about where were heading with the business on the private client group we anticipate to have more pcg teams going forward than signature had pretty much which is really the momentum of the business model when it comes to dda it was stable throughout the entire quarter and as we indicated we were up slightly which is a very positive signal based on what we anticipated when we announced the transaction so clearly better than expected i think whats exciting about it is that the opportunity to take the business model and look at the other opportunities that we have as a combined company and look at the overall corporate finance opportunity we have within these middle markets groups so thats another exciting attribute and the teams are excited to be building back the liabilities that have shredded off the balance sheet because of the fear in march and not only are we seeing positive momentum there the teams are excited its stable and we believe that over time as things start to stabilize well get more deposits back and we have eric here on the line so eric if you want to share some commentary about what were seeing with the teams eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc yes thanks tom look the teams are really starting to have success and attract those clients back our clients simply just dont want to be at the mega institutions that they ran to they cant provide the level of service that we can provide so we are seeing strong demand deposit growth because the teams really provide stellar service were also seeing strong offbalance sheet money market fund growth because our clients appreciate our service and want us to be able to control the entire client experience so were seeing clients come back were seeing new client growth and were obviously seeing the ability to attract new banking teams so its going to be very powerful as we look forward new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and thats also pre first republic as we focus on the opportunity that dislocated the marketplace we believe is great great opportunity as we got into bringing on new pcg teams that focus on service and obviously that have the entrepreneurial view of what signature built over the years when it comes to deposit gathering efforts so excited about that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and john do you happen to have the purchase accounting accretion number for the quarter john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so that was another item that came in better than expected and one of the reasons why our margin was as strong as it was if you look at it from both institutions flagstar really came in where we anticipated it in that million range it was the signature purchase accounting that came in faster we had more significant paydown in the loan portfolio than we anticipated the portfolio dropped by a little under billion due to a couple of different movements between loan categories and our negotiations about which loans that we took that we talked about on the last call so when you look at the actual accretion it was million for signature in the quarter and about million of that was related to unanticipated paydowns brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then last one for john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc going forward brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yes go ahead john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes sorry brody just going forward i would expect that to be more in that million million range but it is of course as you know dependent on which loans pay down and what kind of marks we had against those loans brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then the last one from me tom i think you addressed the uptick in npls i thought i heard you say there is from the inclusion of acquired loans or something i was just hoping you could address the cre the increase in the cre npls and if any of that was tied to office just because i noticed that you said that you did have youve got a decent amount of office reappraisals done at this point as well new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes so specifically to npas we had an uptick on signature loans that we acquired so you would assume thats in the purchase thats probably well embedded in purchase accountings were comfortable that were covered there when it comes to any potential loss there but thats million of signature exposure that we acquired as part of the transaction the other piece mostly is from loans acquired through flagstar the ph other million in total from the loans acquired from flagstar so overall it was flat when you take out the acquisitions all together brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you very much everyone i appreciate it operator thank you and next question comes from steve moss with raymond james please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning sorry if i missed it here but i wanted to ask about the first republic team just some teams you hired just curious as to what kind of book of business or how big a book of business is and any color you can give there tom thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc please let me start off by saying were superexcited to have them and were superexcited to build it and build a pcg model and continue to invest in that model so we are making investments clearly signatures growth organically was is the model right so its very similar entrepreneurial in how they look at the business as a high wide high touch service focusing on boots on the ground and making their clients very comfortable on a banking perspective so thats so the focus here is that theres a dislocation in the marketplace its very competitive im going to pass it on to eric but before that i just want to tell you that were superexcited to have them stay tuned its a lot of activity out there and hopefully we continue to be successful on convincing these team members to become part of the new flagstar so eric do you want to give some more color there eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc yes i mean each one of these teams comes with a book of billions of dollars of deposits and loans as well as wealth assets and the aum so very excited to have all of them there are three in new york three in california thus far as tom alluded to and we just feel that were the best without question the best cultural fit for these bankers right we have an entrepreneurial model like they had that truly caters to the clients needs with that new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 single point of touch contact so this is a great home for them its great cultural fit we have the products and services that we need to go to market which is critical and were really looking forward to their future success here but billions in deposits and loans per team steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay appreciate that color and eric you mentioned that deposit momentum remains strong sounds like its into july is there any color you could give around the trends youve seen after june 30th just to kind of get a feel for whats coming on thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start off by saying were seeing overall for the banks in total is very stable i will tell you that we still have to deal with some of the assets are going to be sold in the market that are attached to the core franchise of ph signature in particular ventures so we anticipate to see that run off eventually and that sale was done as soon as deposits will follow the outside of the anticipated businesses that were not acquired to the transaction we see strong stability and in addition to signature transaction the community bank franchise has been very stable maybe reggie can share some commentary on what were seeing on the community bank but were a diversified company so maybe reggie you can add some color to what were seeing on the retail side reginald e davis a senior executive vp presidentbanking new york community bancorp inc sure tom so yes tom said through the balance of the year we had lost about deposits through the liquidity challenge that the banking industry faced but were starting to see those deposits come back they definitely stabilized and were actually starting to see some modest opportunity for growth were projecting actually the deposits stay relatively flat through the balance of the year and that our weighted average cost is de minimis in terms of the inquiry so we feel really good about the stability of that portfolio i think it reflects the strong relationship that our bankers have with our clients and then on the commercial side equally were seeing ph some opportunity actually some deposits because we look at opportunities to strategically bring on clients who are maybe disenfranchised from other lending organizations that cannot land in the current environment and so were actually picking up some relationships on that side as well so very positive momentum on the deposit side thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats great ph color i like to addition culturally the focus here is relationship deposit gathering in all of our lines of businesses thats the culture here going forward i said it many quarters deposits deposits deposits culture culture culture and on the culture build theyre really meshing well were putting three companies together to build a new flagstar and clearly i think on the lending side our lending teams truly understand that were leading with the deposit opportunity we really want to make sure that we fund the balance sheet commercial bank like in our transition from dependency on wholesale finance will dissipate over time but weve made significant strides in that way over the past few years notable if you look at the percentage of wholesale to total deposits so were excited about that but that is the culture thats all building here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc great appreciate all the color there and one last one for me just on expenses here as you look to integrate all three banks kind of curious as to where do you think if you have any update as to where the expense run rate could shake out post the integrations in some point in thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i mean we gave public guidance it was about billion to billion is that right john that was the public guidance we gave thats fully loaded with anticipation of being billionplus bank the first republic teams that we anticipate bringing on so we think we have some reasonable conservatism around that given the nature of the growth story this is going to be a very powerful opportunity for us to capitalize in the marketplace with this location and we feel that as we go into youll start seeing a lot of integration benefits of putting the systems together so that the significant adjustment that well see next year will be through consolidations of systems and were looking forward to that john if you want to add some color john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so when you look at that billion to billion thats our guide as tom mentioned with the conversions that we have coming in were comfortable that our noninterest expense base is not going to grow dramatically off of that guide from to so thats where were comfortable very consistent with what we said in our last call where we mentioned where we might see some of the upcoming quarters be a little bit higher but we think it will stabilize over time and we think itll stabilize in this range thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and that has the anticipated cost structure of the new teams maybe eric can talk a little bit about economics how we view the business and how we can build that to neutrality and ultimately to a total return basis eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc and ultimately we see the deposits and loan growth that will be coming in getting us to a breakeven in about a year and a total earn back in months on that which is pretty normal for team growth when you acquire these teams they come with nothing right theres no loans theres no deposits its not like acquiring a bank so it does take a little bit longer for them to ramp up and get to a breakeven point because you just dont have those revenue streams out the gate but what happens over multiple years is that they continue to grow right and they dont stop growing because of the way that we align their interest with those of the overall bank so when you look down the road after three years theyre well into 20plus roe and thatll continue to ratchet up over time thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc as we pay down expenses finance thats the goal new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc great thank you very much thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you your next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning question on just on the nim benefit from those billion of custodial deposits from signature this quarter should we just think of that as ph those billion of deposits add the rate you get with the fed is that the benefit to nim this quarter from that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes thats the benefit we did keep that money at the fed the number you know that was the number at june 30th the average number was a little higher when you look back at especially april and may but yes its at about and id say the average is probably closer to billion manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it so as these deposits come down and i think youre saying they should only really start coming down in the fourth quarter right so over the next quarter or so john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc should you still get some benefit john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no the large piece and thats why you see the guide on the margin being lower than ph the actual in q3 right so the large amount of the pay of the custodial deposits we believe happened in the second quarter we think that the payoffs in the portfolios have slowed a little bit so were collecting a lot less right now plus the announcement that the fund banking business is expected to hit market and potentially be sold in new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 october were going to see a drop in the third quarter just because of the way that the cash flows in that portfolio occurred in q2 compared to our expecting them to occur in q3 so were going to see that ph billion go out very quickly in july thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and its in our margin guide john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc correctly thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right perfect and then separately just on regulation were expecting the basel iii endgame rules today now that youre over billion in assets can you talk about how youre planning for any increase in capital requirements and how you think about the right level of capital that youd like to maintain thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so ill start off and ill defer to john but obviously this is until the rules come out well have better clarity so well have it when you have it and hopefully very soon sometime today at end of the day we spent a lot of time thinking through it and obviously we believe therell be some type of implementation period but this company is building capital this company for the first time in a long time is generating tangible book value creation by the earnings power of the company so we feel very confident that we have adequate capital and when the rules come out well be able to assess how it impacts our position at billion just bear in mind over the past decade actually going back to weve been preparing to be a ccorp bank and since weve right before the flagstar transaction we were preparing to be billion bank right under the new rules so clearly this is going to have some impact and then weve seen the actual literature on it well assess it and run the analysis to see how it will impact us but clearly were prepared for it and john if you want to add some color there as well john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes for some of the items that were expecting is going to be in the proposed rules including the lack of an aoci optout we actually screen really well when you look at us comparative to our peers in the billionplus range where you look at cet1 when you include the loss on securities and we jump to the top quartile of capital ratios against a lot of our peers so theres a lot of no doubt a lot of work to do once the proposed rules really come out and well analyze it and as tom mentioned well deal with the implementation period and go forward new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 from there no doubt therell be higher needs for capital but we are generating it on an organic basis right now which is really nice to see thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats right manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right and your forward expense guide would also include any investments that you need to make on the regulatory side to become a larger bank john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc or to be a larger bank john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats right yes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you and next question comes from bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning bernard bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning just on loan growth so it was modest but you noted it reflected some of the presentation efforts and a disciplined client selection underwriting you did have some growth in mortgage warehouse so just wondering where are you seeing across your verticals with regard to demand and what is your outlook for loan growth in the back half of the year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well its interesting weve had obviously a disrupted market since the fed was very proactive in raising interest rates at least on the multifamily cre side so if you think about whats going on with that portfolio its relatively flat and our coupons are rising significantly as customers are opting to go into a sofr option as they get ready for what they anticipate hopefully lower rates in their perspective in and so weve had about billion that we didnt have in a year ago or a year and a half ago that opted to take the sofr option which puts us in a very good position right now thats slightly south of coming off a coupon and theyre paying the bills which is phenomenal and these are wealthy customers and theyre making business decisions not to lock in a fixed rate structure in the other side of that we also opted to put into synthetically some structure that allows them to lock in well call it a quite a swap transaction tied to a fixed rate option that they could live with given if they feel that this is the right fixed rate time to lock in the next five to years thats also been a new strategy for the bank but on the multifamily ph side having a cre is not a lot of activity so we think that will turn in or as rates may go lower for them it will have a lot of opportunity at the same time were gearing up for the signature portfolio thats interrelated as customers so were going to look at those opportunities and bank the relationship that we have we have a lot of cross relationships so we think there will be some good growth there as we go into and so i think that business which is the largest component of our balance sheet when it comes to asset classes is operating as expected given the environment in respect to the other lines of businesses its been a reasonable growth story were allocating capital based on hurdle rate of returns its more of a philosophical view as we look at the businesses and more importantly were hurdling at expected it returns because credit trends are much tighter right now so were able to offer a much higher rate given the marketplace so its a tighter credit market in all our businesses so were seeing strong opportunity in builder finance you mentioned warehouse warehouse is doing extremely well because of dislocation many banks that were in the warehouse business cant be in the warehouse business given what happened in march and were seeing the overflow into our book and we welcome that opportunity and its all finance so maybe lee if you want to talk a little bit about msr and warehouse as well as on the mortgage side were seeing some positive trends there but i would say in theory right now as expected based on our growth trajectory were as according to plan i think i said it last quarter we dont have to make a loan this year and well do very well the good news is that our businesses are thriving and were looking forward to allocate capital to this opportunity at much higher spreads so lee if you want to talk a little bit about warehouse msr and you may want to talk a little bit about the mortgage business as well lee matthew smith a senior executive vp presidentmortgage new york community bancorp inc yes sure thanks tom so let me start with warehouse and youll see from the numbers average balances were up million quarteroverquarter now part of that was due to mortgage volumes being up about quarteroverquarter when you look at what was happening in the industry and we got the natural lift from that but as tom mentioned theres been dislocation in the warehouse space and weve seen a number of players new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 announce that theyre exiting and we can take advantage of that weve already seen towards the end of the quarter some of the clients that were party to those banks that are exiting reach out to us and as you know were already the second largest warehouse lender in the business and so as we move into the second half of this year we think we can take more market share as a result of the dislocation and some of these other players exiting now as tom says when we make loans whether its warehouse or msr were always looking at the return on equity and the great thing about warehouse is it turns very quickly and so were generating very strong returns and we feel confident that we can continue to show market share growth as we move through the second half of the year just given the dislocation were seeing thats also spreading into the mortgage servicing lending arena as well and weve seen players pull back as theyre looking to sort of preserve capital weve got a very strong capital position and so weve seen good growth from an msr servicing advance lending point of view and we think well continue to see that as we move through the second half of this year as well and then just coming back to mortgage originations generally and as tom mentioned theres been dislocation in that space weve seen a major player exiting the market weve seen minor players exiting the market and our falloutadjusted locks quarteroverquarter increased thats what we calculate gain on sale on the vast majority of that increase were in the tpo channels particularly the correspondent channels given some of the dislocation that i just mentioned and we feel that well continue to take advantage of that as we move through the second half of the year as well so a lot of this dislocation is really playing into our hands and we feel good about our positioning weve been in the mortgage business years weve been in the warehouse business years and were performing very well right now thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes so in addition to that i think the reality is that we are in these businesses and theyre thriving but more importantly the focus towards the complete banking relationship were seeing good deposit flows we want to do better we wanted higher compensating balances but thats the mandate and given that this dislocation is moving assets of other balance sheets we are seeing higher deposit compensating balances in these lines of business which is very encouraging for our culture going forward as being a relationship depositdriven institution bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc no i appreciate thats a great color if i have one followup i think this question is for eric so legacy signature had a specialized banking team that focused on eb5 deposits im just curious was that team acquired if so wondering if you could comment on any pipeline growth that could be there thank you eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc yes we actually exited that team while maintaining the book and moving it to another team that did have experience in that field and we do anticipate that we will see growth in that area eb5 now is a bit more stable now that the government has approved the eb5 program for five years they used to do it on an annual basis and often they didnt approve it timely given congressional matters so the program is now in place for an extended period of time and we are adding more capabilities there and were actually bringing on board a client a banker from another institution to rejoin us and we expect to see some pretty significant growth in that space as the deposits build new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and is it similar to prior projections or is there anything you could provide on that eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc i think its a little too early to say right we really need to see how clients anticipate utilizing the eb funds in their various project stacks i would think that well see billions over time in deposits but i think its going to take a little bit longer a bit more of a lead time than we saw in the past bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for taking my questions eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc thank you operator thank you your next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys great quarter thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just going back to the conversation on the teams it seems like you guys have a great opportunity going forward here to capture even more of the first republic teams as well as successful teams from other banks given the incentive structures you guys now have in place was wondering how the new team pipeline looks at this point after capturing those teams was curious if that got peoples attention i would think that it would have and might even bring even more interest and then just going back to what eric mentioned on what these teams are bringing over it was great hearing about the billions of deposits and loans but you also mentioned aum which was a very exciting part of the first republic business do you guys need to develop or build out any functionality to support those wealth assets or just the wealth business in general and then is that going to be a big focus here in terms of bringing on more teams with wealth management assets and growing that business going forward new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc im going to be very short and sweet in this one and would defer to eric but just stay tuned because things are fluid but eric why dont you handle that question eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc sure thanks dave thanks tom and good to talk to you dave yes i mean the opportunity is real right when you look at the banking landscape the mega banks who we specifically built the institution to compete against and theyre more arrogant than ever which is great bankers at the regional banks quite frankly dont have ammunition to go to market with right so we not only have a balance sheet to utilize but we have an approach and a teambased compensation model and practices that are attractive to these bankers out there so i think it is sending a buzz around the industry we are actively engaged with a number of other teams to look to bring on board and we will certainly be adding to our wealth capabilities we did add some people already that well be announcing but we broadly have the capabilities on the wealth side to meet the needs of these of the teams and the clients that theyre onboarding we always are looking to improve but id say dave that we have the vast majority of the needs that we can meet their needs of their clients right now so we feel good about the capabilities that we have and now its just attracting the wealth management side of the business to work with those banking teams david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great that sounds good maybe just a smaller one on the margin and borrowings rolling off it sounded like youve got another roughly billion or so in the back half of this year i was just curious what that opportunity looks like for next year as you try to offload the rest of this wholesale funding john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so next year ph billion at a is what we have coming so that portfolio has really really gotten low compared to where weve been in the past especially for the size bank we are right now but yes billion this year assuming some of the portables get put which we are assuming that they will given their current cost and next year ph billion at a thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so dave just to be specific when we announced the signature transaction our plan was to pay down the wholesale and be more obviously depositfocused this is in our strategy so as john indicated a lot of the higher cost stuff has paid off already and weve replaced it with demand money and liquidity from the transaction but i think holistically going forward we want to be obviously having a much more focused loanto deposit ratio indicative of a commercial bank model but obviously as we said time and time again the culture here is relationship banking the length of the deposits lever the deposit opportunities and we think we have a lot of lowlying fruit as we put this organization together one of the areas that we didnt talk a whole lot about but we have a very diversified team of people that can really serve as the signature transaction when it comes to opportunity on the corporate banking side and i think thats going to be something in the years to come thats going to be very favorable as we look at leading deals for these new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 middlemarket clients these are very strong companies and we have tremendous deposit relationships but they dont have a lot well call it loan activity specifically for some of these larger corporate clients as we are not leading the corporate side of the balance sheet so we can be active there as well syndicating deals structuring deals and being a corporate finance banker so a lot of opportunity to put these companies together the excitement level is high and looking forward to the future david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right all sounds great guys appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you dave operator your next question comes from matt breese please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning everybody thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey just to be clear either tom or john the custodial deposits when do you expect them to kind of draw down to a nearzero balance is that by the end of the year or early next year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc were going to see a big drop in the third quarter because of just the nature of the paydowns that we saw early on in the portfolio so that billion will there still be a number over the next couple of quarters but its going to drop dramatically my guess would be in the billion to billion range in the third quarter and then drop even further from there it would it ends up going to zero if and when the fdic sells the loans and if we dont retain servicing from whoever the new buyer is of that portfolio so its just the collection of pi and any paydowns and then the remittance back to the owner matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great i appreciate that and then i wanted to follow up on expenses so for the full year we have a billion to billion guide can you just level set and provide me where we are relative to that number yearto date i see that million but i wanted to confirm it because it implies a rampup in expenses for the back half of this year and then a pretty significant rampdown in as we think about flattish expenses new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so youre right when you look at the six months right were just under billion right now given where we are if you looked at the second quarter run rate its just under billion run rate we will have some expenses as tom had mentioned thats in this guide which is included in the new rules that well see later today most likely and then just the normal billion to make sure were above billion so were going to see some increased expenses in for that and then we believe once we can get the systems conversions done thatll be what allows us to stay pretty close to flat in when you compare it to so as i mentioned early on were going to see a rampup in expenses in the next couple of quarters i mentioned that on the last call theres a lot of work going on theres a lot of work being done for the fdic loans as well and as you know remember that benefit right now is showing up in noninterest income that will drop over time and as that drops over time well be able to get some efficiencies on the noninterest expense side if were not ended up servicing those loans when we get into depending on what happens with those assets thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes so matt just one other point and this is tom is that were also investing into the pcg model so we have some teams coming on board projected into this run rate and that will also commensurate with some good revenue opportunities as we go to the breakeven as eric indicated were anticipating a one year breakeven on bringing the teams on and from there we have hurdle rate of returns that were targeting to 20plus over a very short period of time so thats also in our run rate so clearly the first republic transaction didnt happen the guide would be very different but were clearly investing in the model which will have significant deposit opportunity revenue opportunity across the board and profitability to the bottom line over time so thats also embedded in our forecast matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay maybe if we were to think about the back half of should we think about at that point getting to a billion to billion or right around the same kind of guide range annualized run rate and expect kind of a bell curve shape rise and decrease in expenses until then is that the way to think about it john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i mean i dont know about bell shape but yes i would assume that when we get to the q3 q4 numbers we would see all things being equal that those expenses would be lower than q1 and q2 right were expecting the flagstar conversion will be in february of so the back half of the year will be more of a run rate kind of perspective when we get through that so i think thats right i dont think its dramatic but i do think that you will see lower run rate expenses in q3 and q4 as compared to q1 of matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay thank you for that color last one can you just describe the interest rate position of the bank at this point and how the nim would respond in call it a down basis point scenario and whether or not you want to describe that parallel shift or just the front end coming down i would just appreciate some color on asset sensitivity liability sensitivity and maybe adjusted for liquidity new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes no absolutely so as if you look back to the first quarter we were moderately to very highly assetsensitive given the amount of cash that was on the balance sheet we are now slightly assetsensitive and that asset sensitivity just with the passage of time and the utilization of some of the cash on hand and some of the loan growth that we may see in the back half of the year we believe will get to very close to neutral so were not an outlier anymore as we had been historically on the liability side we think right now were slightly asset sensitive with the trend to get a little less assetsensitive matthew breese q analyst stephens inc right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes and just one other point think about the customers on the multifamily cre side naturally if rates were to go lower in our customers are going look to take their floating rate instruments probably lock in some fixed rate structure and then you are going to see a lot of activity from the portfolio we had really virtually no prepayment activity for the past year its been a slow market so we anticipate a lot of activity which will naturally organically put this company in a very interesting position when it comes to managing interest rate risk with the clientele will be active if theres a rate change next year so were anticipating some activity there which can naturally hedge the balance sheet towards neutrality we want to be agnostic in movement in interest rates thats the plan here we dont want to be liabilitysensitive too much or assetsensitive too much we want to be relatively neutral as we make money in any interest rate environment obviously the goal here was to get to we think we got here probably a couple of quarters earlier thats a positive attribute in the current environment because of the stability of the signature transaction but our loan book is all reacting very favorably when it comes to spreads and more importantly its a tight credit market right so as i indicated the loan spread offering right now is higher and were getting it and then thats with industrywide so there is some tight credit standards and customers have to finance or were going to be in the market were in business and were comfortable on working with our clients but the beauty of this opportunity is that its a much higher spread matthew breese q analyst stephens inc appreciate all the color thats all i had thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thanks matt operator thank you and your next question comes from peter winter with da davidson peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co i was just wondering could you give an update on the office portfolio and then secondly just are you seeing any type of stress on the multifamily portfolio just between the inflation pressures higher interest rates and its just harder to increase rents on the rentstabilized apartments thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes so peter ill start and ill defer to john the cfo but clearly its been resilient on the multifamily side its been an environment where we have a lot of wealthy customers theyre going through this journey of no activity theres a coupon from the lowest going into id say ph close to and so there is no a substantial change and theyre weathering the storm theyre paying their bills like i indicated probably of loans coming up for decision on their actual maturity andor repricing theyre choosing a sofr option and theyre holding that until they feel its the right time to lock in a fixed rate structure which is unusual because we havent seen this environment in quite some time but they are doing well in that environment theres no question that the bank is benefiting from that and they are getting some cash flows adjustments to their income stream but these are wealthy customers that have large portfolios and theyre weathering the storm theyre waiting for low interest rates and we have tremendous asset quality performance as a result of this environment which is a positive discussion point we can talk well tell you about the fact that its cash flows are being squeezed of course the interest rates going from to is going to have an impact but we think that were getting close to the point where if we stabilize on the sofr side and there is this view that next year will be the year where the feds will have to adjust their policy stance then customers may be very active on thinking about the next five years to years of financing were not seeing any late pays were not seeing any delinquencies on multifamily the commercial real estate portfolio is doing extremely well its resilient we have statistics in the deck we talked about that were not going to be perfect because obviously its an environment where its fluid but it seems like as we reappraised buildings as we get deep into the portfolio and we deal with some oneup issues its been a very resilient portfolio so with that im going to have john go to the statistics but i will tell you that were very pleased with the asset quality given the rampup of interest rates and john if you want to share some of the statistics on the commercial side john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes and especially to your question peter on office right we do have a slide we added some additional information as were going to continue to do over time the portfolio of billion really pretty consistent from the prior quarter with ph average dsvrs and ltvs and average balance and we did have just under of our office exposure has been appraised or reappraised in and so theres of its rated special mention or substandard new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 so the portfolios been strong we have seen some early delinquencies we think the bulk of them will be cleared in the third quarter but we are working through a couple of items as you can imagine but still its been very strong its breadandbutter type lending for us its the same structure that we did and that weve done historically for decades with multifamily just with a different collateral base so very cautiously optimistic about the portfolio we have been actually since covid hit and if you could see theres really not much coming due in the rest of and so the bulk of the portfolio had the option or contractual date starting really in and forward peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks very helpful and then can i just ask a followup on the mortgage warehouse you had nice growth in mortgage warehouse are you able to get deposits with the mortgage warehouse business and the reason i ask is typically fourth quarter tends to be seasonally weak and so do those deposits flow out thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ph lee if you want to lee matthew smith a senior executive vp presidentmortgage new york community bancorp inc yes thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc lee go ahead lee matthew smith a senior executive vp presidentmortgage new york community bancorp inc yes so i think the answer is yes we can bring in deposits with the warehouse lending business as we can with all lending businesses and its a focus of the bank tom has been very clear that its deposits deposits deposits so the answer is yes we can bring in deposits from the warehouse customers i think the other thing that i would point out is we can bring in more deposits from the mortgage ecosystem as part of the signature acquisition we acquired a cash and treasury management team that focused on the mortgage ecosystem and you think of all the tpos we work with tpos we have warehouse customers you think of the msr owners that we subservice for or we lend to so we think there is a big opportunity to bring in more deposits from that mortgage ecosystem peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you operator thank you and next question comes from christopher mcgratty please go ahead new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john just a followup to a prior comment about the assets or the rate positioning of the balance sheet if you zoom out and just think more holistically about does the company make more money in the down rate environment could you speak to potentially the opportunity for better loan growth and better mortgage if the forward curve is right in john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes i mean there are a lot of even being slightly assetsensitive depending on how the curve moves the other item to really think about we talk about asset sensitivity from an nii perspective but if we see significant declines in rates the mortgage banking business the warehouse business is going to really really explode from an upside perspective and protect that the income that we lose in some of the other areas so we also have been what tom mentioned on the multifamily portfolio as well i mean youll see prepayment fees start to pick up substantially i mean we havent talked about a prepayment fee in quarters now right so thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and that and when we were a much smaller institution we had a year we made million in prepayment fees so that depending on what happens with the rate curve there are multiple levers in this balance sheet that can help in any really in any rate environment and thats what were going to continue to strive for to try to get the balance sheet as agnostic as possible to interest rates you cant plan of course for everything but thats the goal and you dont forget about that mortgage business which will absolutely pick up if we do see acrossthe board rate declines christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes thanks for that and john while i have you just on the accretable yield if i could for a second could you help us with whats in your guide for the back half of the year i think you said ph came in from from signature but was high whats the right level and whats left to kind of burn through over the next several quarters new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so the easiest way to look at if you combine the two the actual for the second quarter was about million and in the guide is about million on a combined basis and just given the way purchase accounting works thatll slowly decline over time with the exception of paydowns right paydowns depending on what kind of loans pay down you could see some spikes in that number but thats what were in our guide we think its conservative and like i said it is dependent on the market what happens with interest rates and what happens with paydowns but that million or so from signature that were now expecting is higher than we originally anticipated and its just the nature of the portfolio and the speed that portfolio seems to be paying down at christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful and whats the total pool that will come back to you over the next couple of years whats the remaining balance and accretion john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well on the loan side originally the signature piece was over million so we still have to have almost billion in total in loan marks when you look at both banks but ill make sure i get that number ill make sure we get that out there for everyone christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thanks john thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you operator your next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc steven good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so on the balance sheet so youve obviously had a huge transformation over the past year and youve been very clear john about the custodial deposits coming out some higher cost borrowings coming out the second half too but beyond that are there any big structural changes on the horizon we should be thinking about are we finally getting to more or less steady states where its loans and deposits that are just going to drive net interest income john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes i think thats right i mean you can see in the deposits that we have the wholesale borrowings that we have maturing in the next couple of quarters and even next year theyre not at high rates so its much more of business as usual and lets use these deposit funds that we bring in to fund loan growth thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc right john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and over time could we look at paying down wholesale borrowings of course we always could but theres other options and some high cost funding you could always look to reposition and that would be a great problem to have if the demand deposits continue to grow but i think youre right in the fact that that paydown of the high cost borrowings that we did in the second quarter thats behind us thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes i would just add to that steven one point this is tom that the reality when we look at building out the teams and focusing on the pcg model to type of statistics has been the track record for deposit inflows of demand money so every dollar bringing in i think were forecasting but the reality is more like thats going to be a significant catalyst as we change the mix of our deposit funding going forward at the same time were focusing on compensating balances amongst all the lines of businesses and were going after operating accounts payroll accounts we really feel confident that if were going to put our capital at risk we want to make sure we have the relationships so thats going to be a relationshipdriven model and thats where were heading for all of our lines of businesses and thats how were hurdling our returns on loan by loan basis thats a sea change on culture here and i think its refreshing to have that capability now having diversified portfolios we can allocate capital too focusing on deposits gathering steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes and then on the nim i think we all understand why the nim is coming down in the third quarter and typically you dont go beyond that but do you feel the bias is still to the upside right there is some unusual nim activity because of these custodial deposits so once we get beyond that do you feel like at least over the nearterm you should see some expansion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so what i said a quarter ago is that we think we get to that ph type net nim by yearend maybe we got there a couple of quarters earlier and i mean you take that model and you look at the expense base and the size of the balance sheet and put a reasonable return on that on average balance going forward you have an environment that weve done really well in when it comes to growing the ph nim from well quite honestly in the high right so if we get to the mid to low as more of a holistic view of the business model based on the funding mix that we bring to the table as we grow the business its a different run rate right so i think thats something that accelerated here and given the lines of businesses and we talked about the fact that our loan growth has higher spreads we think that 3plus type margin is reasonable and thats the target but we got there a little bit sooner so were excited about that it really has lot to do with the market as well theres definitely a credit tightening in the system and the fed was talking about that publicly theres no question that money is expensive and were getting paid for the risk and more importantly thatll impact stronger margins for this company steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then a final one for eric its great to hear you on this call eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc thanks steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and whats the experience been like for you and the team right going through the fdic now youre in new york community does it feel culturally like the way ph signature felt to you guys fully back on offenses whats going on eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc were back at it steve theres no doubt i mean think about where we were for months ago to where we are today my second text the evening was to tom right and to john and they immediately and when i say immediately immediately got back to me right they embraced us since the moment weve arrived they completely appreciate our culture and what were doing here and were doing a lot around cultural transformation overall across the organization i cant tell you how pleased i am to be here theyve truly just embraced all of us so its about it is the best cultural fit no question in my mind and were really excited about the future i mean steve i said it earlier the opportunity right now is tremendous for us and thats recognized by the executive team here by the entire board here and by the management group right were going to weve got an ph opportunity to on a moment one that we havent seen quite frankly in probably a decade right and i equate whats going on back to the days of when we acquired teams from eab when they were purchased from north fork right when they were acquired i mean this is a tremendous opportunity now there will be further ma even given the regulatory hurdles many of these midmarket and midsized banks need to go away and new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 will and we will be able to capture on that so really excited to be here and very very much looking forward to the future steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sounds good great to hear from you again and best of luck eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc you too thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you steve operator thank you the last question we have ph casey haire with jefferies please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning q thanks good morning guys how are you doing so real quick just on the cash position still strong at billion sounds like the borrowing paydown the lowhanging fruit has been picked but just curious what opportunities do you have to optimize the margin with that excess cash and then more longerterm where does that what is your minimum cash position versus that of assets today john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so we look at cash and unencumbered securities together from an onbalance sheet liquidity perspective and right now were very comfortable with where we are the utilization of the cash and the benefits that we can get that can drive it forward we do have you know the wholesale borrowing trade as i mentioned with the high cost wholesale borrowings that we took care of in q2 we do have some highcost brokered cds that we can always deal with in order to try to maximize and benefit the margin but i think the real benefit in the longerterm focus is what can we do on the deposit side and if we can continue to bring in noninterest bearing demand deposits thats going to be the driver of margin growth in the future how successful we are at that will drive that will drive the margin story thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and i would just also add just on a perspective our balance sheet if you think about banks over billion were probably the lowest percentage of securities assets in the country right now by design new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc we have no held to maturity portfolio we dont believe in it were very comfortable with ph putting in net assets but we have limited exposure there but we have a very small book that needs to be right sized over time as we go into the billion standard so thats another area that probably will generate some additional revenues for the company as we rightsize ourselves to the industry q got you okay and just last one for me apologies if i missed this but the signature teams of the that you guys acquired what is that number today eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc thats what the numbers thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ph i think we started that at we had a handful that ran off again the deposits are stable but whats interesting about the story here is that since our last public release we had full stability there hasnt been any exits at all and its been an encouraging experience as eric said the team is motivated were focused on building back the business getting the clients back into the higher average balances but the accounts are still here a lot of the money has moved to different funding vehicles to try to get out of the system because of the insurance issue but we and eric you may want to talk about some of the strategies we had on off balance sheet thats also accommodating some of the customers right now come back to us eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc yes i mean thats really the new goto market right where look the clients like tom said the clients didnt close their accounts they just moved their funds out right and theyre finding it very difficult very difficult to do business at the mega institutions that they moved to so were seeing the operating accounts come back and thats why we had dda up this quarter right and so thats starting to flow back as they just they cant run their businesses at these other institutions right and then on the excess funds that we normally keep an on balance sheet money market funds for them theyre bringing those back some on balance sheet and some off balance sheet into an array of off balance sheet money market funds that we have available for those clients right so were going to start making some serious fee income on that which doesnt tie up capital right and really juices our returns so thats the new goto market clients are reacting very to that theyre recognizing that we can continue to control the entire client experience for them while also giving them that safety so were seeing successes there across the board quite frankly every time i talk to a team i hear about how unhappy their clients are elsewhere and how theyre starting to come back new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 27jul2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and i think that as i said previously our anticipation is that we will have more teams going into the in short order through the summer where premarch in totality as we continue to evaluate and sign on and onboard the first republic talent thats in the marketplace as there is a dislocation that we are competitively looking to put on new personnel to service the clients and being on their books q got it thanks guys eric howell a senior executive vice president and president of commercial and private banking new york community bancorp inc thanks ph casey thomas robert cangemi a
