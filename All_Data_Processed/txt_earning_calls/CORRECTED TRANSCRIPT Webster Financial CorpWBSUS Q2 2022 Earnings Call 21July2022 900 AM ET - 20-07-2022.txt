president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you shantell good morning and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call im excited to be speaking with you this morning on our quarterly results as i think they are a great illustration of the potential of our company the quality of our execution the team we put together and our colleagues focus and dedication as we progress through the integration im going to start with a high level overview of our financial performance in the quarter review the progress of our integration and other strategic initiatives and then ill turn it over to glenn for a review of the quarters results and the outlook ill wrap it up at the end with a few additional comments including some perspectives on the uncertain macroeconomic environment webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 im on slide as i mentioned just a moment ago the second quarter is a great reflection of websters potential the earnings power of our new company is materializing in the first full quarter following the close of our merger with sterling we exhibited strong and diverse loan growth the quality of our core deposit franchise led by hsa bank and our consumer banking team with a rising rate environment and we maintained an advantageous capital position on an adjusted basis eliminating onetime merger related costs we generated eps of with a return on assets of and a return on tangible common equity of our efficiency ratio was as we continue to execute on the synergies our merger provides and leverage the diverse competencies of our company our loans and total assets grew and respectively in the quarter loan growth was generated across broad industry sectors business lines geographies and asset classes and our asset quality metrics remain favorable with an expanded geography and a growing number of industry verticals our talented colleagues can continue to safely and prudently grow loans the rationale behind this merger of equals was and is relatively straightforward as i stated several times we have created a company with an incredibly diverse funding profile including our hsa bank franchise we have a proven track record of growing loans across a broad set of asset classes and geographies at or above market growth rates with a bigger balance sheet to deepen our relationships with existing sponsors and businesses we materially improve our ability to drive net interest income capital markets revenue and swap and cash management fees in we saw early proof points validating the power of combining the two companies on slide while we continue with key milestones and the integration our colleagues also remain laser focused on our clients and maintaining the day to day operations of the bank and revenue momentum our ability to do both was evident in this quarter we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed the key merger financial metrics we set forth at the announcement over a year ago including to annual loan growth million in expense saves over the first two years and completion of our technology conversion by mid2023 while we continue to manage expenses and look for synergistic opportunities we remain focused on profitable growth and will not shy away from investments in our differentiated high return businesses that will add franchise value and economic profit over time we continue to see opportunities to attract key talent and launch initiatives across all of our high performing business lines in the second quarter we began to consolidate several back office systems including mortgage servicing treasury management and payroll we finalized the structure of our executive management team and were making great progress on the corporate office consolidations we outlined last quarter finally given our increased scale we have been able to formally establish an office of corporate responsibility to oversee the companys community investments philanthropy efforts and sustainability work collectively we have the ability to provide more for our communities in the quarter we announced a billion threeyear community investment program that includes investment in affordable housing and community development small business lending and other philanthropic and community engagement efforts with that im going to turn over to glenn to review our financial performance for the quarter glenn i macinnes executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 thanks john and good morning everyone i will start with the reconciliation of core earnings on slide weve reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with eps of as john noted on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million an eps of a which excluded onetime after tax expenses of million the onetime charges were related to real estate consolidation severance and other merger and integration charges next ill review the balance sheet trends before moving on to the income statement on slide our total assets were billion with total loans of billion and total deposits of billion as you see we delivered strong loan growth on a quarteroverquarter basis in commercial and consumer categories the linked quarter decline in deposits was primarily due to seasonal effects of public funds which ill cover in more detail on a later slide on slide we highlight the diversity of our loan growth which is an illustration of the potential of websters post merger business mix in total we grew loans billion or on a linked quarter basis by category the largest contributors to the increase were ci with million commercial real estate with million and residential mortgages with million switching to the deposits on slide total deposit balances declined by billion or relative to prior quarter the primary driver was a seasonal decline in public funds with balances down billion we expect to see a reversal in the third quarter as tax collections drive higher liquidity at public entities shortterm borrowings were leveraged to fund growth in the quarter a portion of the borrowings will be paid down as public funds rebuild and we continue to gather new deposits hsa deposits were effectively flat on a quarter and up yearoveryear excluding thirdparty administrative accounts deposits increased yearoveryear the impact of tpa run off and an overall growth is becoming much less significant as that book nears an end state additional detail for the hsa bank is on slide in the appendix beginning on slide ill review the details of our income statement we provided our reported to adjusted income statement by line item and compared our adjusted earnings to pro forma first quarter earnings notably on an adjusted basis each of the major line items of our income statement exhibited improvement on a quarterover quarter basis when compared to the aggregated results of sterling and webster last quarter ill cover the individual line items in more detail in subsequent slides our preprovision net revenue on adjusted basis was million up million when compared to the combined first quarter results net interest margin was on a reported basis and our combined efficiency ratio is now on slide net interest income grew by million relative to the pro forma first quarter adjusting for accretion in both periods net interest income was up million quarteroverquarter net interest margin excluding accretion income increased basis points to given the current forward curve we expect further expansion to our core net interest margin throughout the year as illustrated on an earlier slide the cost of deposits increased basis points quarteroverquarter we expect deposit pricing in certain categories will start to move more materially in the future quarters with subsequent fed actions on a yearoveryear basis deposit costs were flat on slide we show our fee income for the quarter and on a yearoveryear basis fees were up million linked quarter and million yearoveryear the improvement in fee income was driven primarily by customer interest rate hedging activity in the commercial bank yearoveryear improvement was also driven by increased deposit related fees as transaction activity increased relative to pandemic impacted periods webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 slide summarizes noninterest expense we reported adjusted expense of million relative to million on adjusted pro forma expense last quarter the decline is driven by the initiatives john outlined in his integration updates including the finalization of the board structure corporate real estate consolidation and the elimination of duplicate systems and vendors slide highlights our allowance for credit losses where we reported provision expense of million and a million increase in our allowance driven by loan growth the provision expense also reflects an improvement in individual credit performance and loan mix which was partially offset by a modestly lower outlook on macroeconomic variables as a result the allowance coverage ratio fell as a percent of loans to as highlighted on slide you can see the underlying credit metrics remained strong we reported linked quarter declines in both nonperforming assets and classified loans down million and million respectively i would also note our delinquencies declined to million from million last quarter net chargeoffs of basis points declined basis point from last quarter and remained at low levels slide highlights our strong capital levels all capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory and internal targets consistent with our previously stated capital targets we repurchased over million shares in the quarter and well continue to be opportunistic with repurchases going forward the net of all capital effects this quarter resulted in a slight decline in our tangible book value per share which decreased to primarily driven by aoci losses the share repurchases partially offset by our strong earnings our common equity tier ratio remained strong at its still well above our minimum term operating target of we anticipate we will prudently and opportunistically return capital to shareholders given the strong internal capital generation from improving profitability sound underwriting credit metrics and the ample reserve on our marked and well diligenced loan portfolio ill wrap up my comments with a refresh on our outlook for the full year we are increasing our guidance on net interest income to billion driven by our projections for the rate environment and strong loan growth this full year outlook excludes million of realized and scheduled purchase accounting accretion the details of which can be found on slide in the appendix our projections assume the fed funds rate ends the year at implying another basis points of rate increases and as a reminder our interest income outlook is on a nonfte basis we now expect loan growth to be near the top end of our to range fee should be in the range of million to million we continue to feel confident in achieving our full year adjusted expense target of billion to billion that being said we will continue to monitor inflationary headwinds and of course continue to invest in our businesses and we are forecasting an effective tax rate of to with that ill turn things back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn five months after closing our merger weve made material progress while we have a ton of work in front of us bringing systems products and processes together we are operating as one organization and the strategic merits of bringing the two companies together is reflected in our accomplishments so far this year weve created a bank with growth capabilities and unique asset classes our commercial loan portfolio has grown yeartodate on an annualized basis we have a bank with a unique funding engine our deposit cost webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 increased basis points this quarter at the same time the fed is increasing shortterm rates at a fast pace weve created a bank with superior capital generation capability the adjusted return on tangible common equity of over this quarter illustrates the potential we have to deliver outsized returns and we have repurchased over million in webster shares since the transaction closed all while maintaining capital levels that provide us with significant flexibility as we move forward finally i do want to address the operating environment and our preparedness as many of our peers have remarked things feel good on the ground today despite tangible macro headwinds and an increased risk of recession we have maintained a consistent and prudent risk management framework that will serve us well in any economic environment specifically as it relates to credit our loan portfolio is diverse with the merger actually serving to eliminate concentrations in asset classes businesses and geographies im very pleased with how quickly we have been able to consolidate and harmonize portfolio management practices across the new organization and in fact we plan to consolidate our credit risk management tech platform in the third quarter we have a robust allowance for loan losses with coverage in the top quartile of our proxy peer group we have benefited from internal and thirdparty diligence on our loan portfolio associated with merger work last year we incurred purchase accounting marks on the loan book we have significant buffers in our capital ratios well above regulatory minimums and our company should continue to generate substantial excess capital moving forward we believe that this provides us significant flexibility to adapt to the constantly changing operating environment in short we believe our strength position the company to operate through macro cycle and generate solid returns to shareholders in both the near and longterm we believe this was a very strong quarter for us webster and its a direct result of the hard work and great execution of our colleagues all during the challenging process of integrating in moe i want to give a big thanks to all of our colleagues and their tremendous efforts operator glenn and i will now take questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from chris mcgratty with keefe bruyette woods your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh hey good morning glenn maybe i just start with you on the balance sheet i appreciate the comments on the public forums i guess a trend that weve all noticed this quarter is just the challenge of growing deposits and im interested in kind of outlook commentary about retention of deposits what you might see in the portfolio that could be at risk and how we should be thinking about funding improved growth thanks glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah great good question chris so heres how were thinking about it so were up ph billion in deposits we mentioned the public funds which are about billion we think thats seasonality so that will come back to us but as we talked about in the past i mean we have multiple levers to pull on the funding side whether its digital or commercial and so we think that will begin to attract new funds in those two channels and some of that will be partially off if you look at things like our dda balance as a percent of total deposits are elevated because of all the liquidity were factoring some of that coming down but at the end of the day we think if you put it all together were still targeting a loan to deposit ratio somewhere around christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and in terms of the investment portfolio is it fair to assume that kind of gradually works lower as you kind of find more profitable ways to glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so billion its about of our earning assets and so over time over the course of time primarily through prepayments and cash flow we think that it probably drift down to like a level but thats probably going to take some time to get there christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay maybe just the last one ill hop back the abated can you just remind me what youre assuming for through the cycle betas on the combined company glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp so look i think over the next four quarters we would think are effective data on a full full deposit base would be closer to and that takes into effect the fact that were capturing new deposits from the various channels that we have so thats how were thinking of it youll recall last quarter we were about we now have another quarter underneath us and so were thinking that over a fourquarter process itll probably be close to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks chris operator our next question comes from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler your line is open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey mark how youre doing mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co good thanks i wondered if you could first share with us your commercial line utilization rates what those look like right now john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah theyre improving marginally so up in march they were up about in june they were up about so were seeing from june from last june theyre up about from the prior quarter theyre up about so were seeing that across the board i think thats kind of consistent with industry and were seeing it in abl where we kind of see the best sign of working capital changes mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly john we saw a small has bucket sold to a competitor recently im curious if these kinds of deals continue to be a priority for webster and whether you think its likely in the quarters ahead well see some of these kinds of transactions john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah mark i think thats a great question and weve been pretty transparent about it obviously as a top five player and you know that top five own of the market we obviously see all the transactions the pricing and the value on many of these transactions are pretty steep so i would say yes its a priority to us you saw us do the bend acquisition which was a combination of a portfolio and technology that we can lever but were also trying to be disciplined with respect to tangible book value dilution and balancing it against the cost of acquiring other deposits so the answer is yes it is a significant priority youve seen deals go up in the market and price has generally been the reason we havent won some of those transactions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then lastly i wondered if you could talk a little bit about your franchise footprint and maybe which geographies you see us having the best growth potential and maybe areas where you might look to prune john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah sure mark this always sounds like a punk answer but the truth is i felt this quarter was really really evidenced of all lenders kind of working at the same time and so you think about the concentrations legacy sterling in new york city sponsor specialty at webster commercial real estate in some areas and so this was a broad quarter of loan growth and were seeing strength in activity in all areas so what i would say is geographically both in our core retail footprint core middle market footprint in more of our regional businesses like commercial real estate or even national businesses like public sector finance or sponsor specialty we see real opportunity and we dont see any geographic areas where were concerned or looking to pull back i would say its more in the asset classes where were being a little bit more careful cyclical businesses businesses that are potentially at risk to higher energy prices cyclicality supply chain disruption office right were obviously looking keenly as to whether or not theres a real paradigm shift going on there with the way people work so i would say its more industry sector more borrower specific than any geography and right now beside a couple of those areas where were keeping an eye on and probably reducing new origination in office in some of the more cyclical businesses all of our geographies are still robust and healthy mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks mark operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to first follow up on chris question on the deposit side so glenn you pointed to loan to deposit ratio target youre basically there can you give more color on your ability to generate low cost deposits right webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 youre saying you have a more diverse deposit base which is fine but which categories should we expect going forward to support and fund loan growth glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so i think its a mix steven and so you get some of the texture weve gone from like a loan to deposit ratio of to this quarter and about of that was driven by the loan growth from the decline in municipal deposits of public funds and we do expect that to come back and pretty strong for the back part of the year i think the key channels for us are going to be on digital and theyre going to be in the commercial business whether its treasury management or whether its transactional type of accounts we will have the natural over the course of the four quarters well have hsa coming in too as we get into the enrollment season and so i have a lot of pluses coming in from the multiple channels but i also have an offset in dda because i think its sort of elevated right now with the combination of all those i think its whats going to bring us today loan to deposit ratio that being said as you can see from the first quarter i mean we did raise or increase what we think our forecasted deposit beta is going to be over four quarters so now when we thought last quarter was going to be were starting to see things heat up a little bit more but that doesnt mean that this is an expensive source of funding on the deposit side but weve moved that closer to over a fourquarter cycle so thats how were thinking about it right now and its all to fund the loan growth which we feel as you saw in this quarter we feel really confident about where we are and operating at the top end of our stated range john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp steve ill just put context from a business perspective as well as glenn mentioned the vast majority of the reduction in deposits was seasonal outflows from public sector and government deposits were adding as you can see loan growth also a lot of new logos a lot of new companies a lot of new relationships in business banking and commercial and we really require our teams out there to make sure those are full relationships with deposits and cash management so youll see more deposits roll in and have a natural growth in commercial because of the number of relationships maybe not because of whats going on in the macro environment from a liquidity perspective but chris motl is out there right now making sure that his folks are focused on deposits and we can refine our pricing a bit to make sure that were able to continue to raise deposits glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah and the last thing i would add steve is that our investment portfolio as you know is elevated right now we think the more natural level more investment ph for growth is probably closer to and so as well get the cash flow out of the investment portfolio which is running about million a quarter thats going to go into the fund to loan growth as well and so that will take some time to come off but were basically picking up basis points basis points on that trade as it flows more into the loan book steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 okay thats helpful id like to shift direction and talk about hsa bank for a minute so if i look at the yearover year growth metrics this basically went from one of your fastest growing segments if not the fastest growing segment to one of the slowest even after i adjust for the thirdparty administration stuff how much of the downshift do you see as structural versus cyclical and whats the environment we need to transform this again into a growth engine for the company john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp i think thats a great question steve and you know that were focused on it because we think its a terrific asset so i think if you cut through were really pleased with the performance in terms of on the ground execution in winning rfps and going after direct to employer relationships and the data that we show say that we do a really good job there kind of at market some of our bigger relationships with healthcare providers have grown a little bit slower than market so the net result of all of that is the whole market the hsa industry has slowed obviously from kind of that growth rate more towards high single digits low teens and weve been trailing that by a couple of percentage points given the mix of our business so it has slowed i think the drivers are much more industry worldwide and were obviously growing the deposit at yearoveryear is still a wonderful thing particularly with the characteristics of the long duration and low cost nature of those deposits so one of the things were doing steve the bend acquisition we are right now integrating that technology with our own customer portal and were rolling that out to clients as we speak over the next six months and in beta testing our customers and our employees really like that we think that will increase participation and increase funding amount providing the great digital experience and education to our existing million plus account holders about why they should be savers and not spenders and we think that there will be a material uplift in average deposits so were kind of working everything were working transparency tools products were working better technology experience were focused on sales and so our goal is to be able to come to the market and say were growing at market rates and as it relates to the market we do think coming out of the pandemic that well see a strengthening of that kind of market industry growth rate as well so we want to make sure when that happens that we can be a strong participant steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and if i could ask one final one john big picture question talk to us about how the integration of the two cultures is going whats going well what needs more attention i know you havent done the system conversion yet but how has the customer experience been thus far thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure ill start with your last question the customer experience has been really really good because we havent disrupted anything really from an operational perspective so because this deal was so complementary all of our frontline folks are here all of our customers are dealing with the same people they were dealing with and i think thats one of the reasons we were able to kind of beat market growth on loan so customer experience so far good one of the reasons why we are having our technology conversion in mid2023 is because we are determined not to disrupt our customers and i think thats why were taking a slower and more deliberate approach webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 as it relates to culture if i sat here right now five months after closing at a transaction i give us kind of in a a minus and im really happy i cant believe we would be better off with respect to alignment at the top with the management team the way were cascading messaging down all that being said an moe is hard and so the idea of making sure that every last one of our colleagues feels as if theyre part of one singular team takes a lot of hard work a lot of purposeful training but it also takes time and so id be lying to you if i told you that if you walked around our entire organization everyone would feel like this was the place they worked in for the last years so were working really hard at that and so far its worked really well weve got great alignment people are executing our risk framework is great our relationships the regulators are great we have not seen attrition in key areas so i couldnt be more pleased but im also i dont have my head in the sand and i know that its a long road to get to the perfect spot steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for all taking my questions john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks steve operator our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc just thinking about the loan growth guide versus what youve already accomplished yeartodate is the to growth range is that a safe annualized rate from here or should we incorporate the tremendous amount of growth youve already seen john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp well i mean were looking at it incorporating the growth im not sure we can put up another organic growth rate so look glenn guided to the high end of that range theres a chance we could outperform it if the environment stays strong the reason weve always talked about that to and we go back and forth on webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 people telling us well never make it and then telling us its too much and then figuring out whether or not were going to go above that is i think weve been able to sustainably grow our loans particularly on the commercial side and now were getting good traction on the consumer side as well in that to range so i think what you can do matt is push that out into as well so i think were looking every quarter to try and post an to annualized growth rate some quarters will be higher and lower depending on prepayments and certain origination characteristics but were not saying were going to grow loans another in the next six months were saying that were sticking to our to loan growth range for the year but obviously we have an opportunity to be at the high end of the range or outperform matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood and the way the pipeline looks does it seem like growth can be as diverse as it was this quarter john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp you know it does right now and i kind of say that with a smile yeah im thrilled because it appears that the teams across this franchise and the different asset classes have a lot of energy and their pipelines are healthy and i think were being really disciplined matt on risk selection as well i think were understanding pockets of asset classes that could be vulnerable to a downturn and i think were being disciplined in making sure were not reaching too far from the bottom in any one area so we still see broad growth we had broad growth in commercial real estate middle market sponsor specialty public sector finance abl and all of our mortgage and consumer lending all really kind of in that plus area so it was really nice to see the granular growth matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great and then i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the bankingasaservice effort at webster and what was brought over from legacy sterling what that entails curious the amount of deposits its important to the overall funding effort and the outlook for growth i guess i didnt fully appreciate how important that was towards the end days of sterling and im curious if thats going to be one of the primary drivers of deposit growth as we head deeper into this rate hike cycle john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp its a great question and as you can tell probably from glenns earlier response on deposits we are not sort of factoring that in as a major driver in the next couple of quarters although we do see a clear path to billion pipeline in that area of relatively low cost deposits with existing relationships that were working with so what id say is thats kind of gravy on our plate it is what we believe to be another strategic lever that hopefully will kind of have operational for a period of time and so i think that what were saying is its not a major driver of deposit growth over the next quarter or two but it could be significant matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then my last one i noticed that abl npas increased a bit quarteroverquarter looks like some of it transitioned from to 89day obviously not a huge number but i am focused on equipment lending nearterm as an area that could see some stress across the industry so im just curious could you give us some background on the combined equipment book the exposures the types of equipment you underwrite historical webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 losses and then just an overall sense for how that book is shaping up from a stress perspective in this environment john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think were not too concerned right now because weve got pretty good collateral coverage its an interesting bringing these two equipment finance businesses together theres almost everything there matt so theres granular low ticket stuff thats volumebased theres also participations in larger banks larger transactions and equipment finance so i think some more cyclical businesses as you can imagine theres nothing in there from a kind of a systemic perspective that scares us with respect to kind of credit performance right now and as you can see we really havent grown the business were kind of putting over a new framework on how were going to attack the market and weve kind of been slowly trying to build back up originations in profitable and granular areas so all i can say right now it hasnt been a big driver of growth were not particularly concerned given the collateralized nature of the business and kind of outsized loss in the portfolio and more to come on kind of strategically how we move forward with that combined business matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood great i appreciate taking my questions thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp great thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from laurie hunsicker with compass point your line is open laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc hey hi thanks glenn john good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey good morning laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc question if its sort of a bigger question if we could say on loan and credit here can you give us a refresh on your leverage loan book and then how much of that is in the sponsor specialty areas just with respect to balanced credit chargeoffs and more importantly with the warning signals starting to flash how youre thinking about that and just remind us how its different versus where you sat during the gfc glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 how much time do we have laurie no im only kidding good question so ill give you the kind of the fun facts so our leveraged loans end of period balances were around billion representing of total loans and about of commercial loans as of june which is roughly in line from a percentage perspective with what its historically been and as you know when we talked about merger one of the wonderful things is it reduced the overall concentration in the numbers with a bigger balance sheet and bigger loans i will tell you that the portfolio of leverage loans is about to in the sponsor specialty world which is good news because its in industries and sectors that have repeatable protectable sustainable cash flows those are tech and infrastructure healthcare services stuff that weve been doing for a long time with sponsors weve known for or years the portfolio continues to perform at or around the overall performance level of the rest of the commercial banks which had been the case through both the great recession and the pandemic there is a little bit more volatility in the risk ratings in the leverage book because obviously those risk ratings start a little bit lower and with leverage there can be a little more variability in risk rating however the strength of the financial sponsors behind the deals have continued to have that not result in higher levels of nonaccruals or losses the other thing ill say about the book is its more granular so if you think about the leveraged loans making up of the commercial loan book they only make up about of our aggregate exposure in top exposures and names so if you think about that our leverage loans tend not to be the highest commitments in single point exposures in the organization and thats obviously intentional so well keep you posted but so far our premise has worked really well and weve also been disciplined about where we do that activity about the people who we allow to do that activity and how much of that activity is in the organization as a percentage of tier capital plus reserves for the overall portfolio laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks and do you have what your balance of nonperformers is relative to that billion book and what chargeoffs are and then i just have one more quick follow up thanks glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah i dont have those numbers off base but little to no loss in that book i know over the last five years but we can reach back out to you over that laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks and then just one last question office can you remind us what is the balance that you have in office and how much of that is in new york city ph thanks thats all my question glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp sure we have about billion in office exposure all around if you take of office medical related office which has a completely different characteristic youre about down to billion or so split half between class a and class b and c underwritten at ltvs obviously those are at underwriting so those ltvs have probably moved up a bit depending on what your view of value is there with a times average debt service coverage about million of that exposure is in new york city in the five boroughs if you take out webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 medical office again its about million in traditional office in the five boroughs and it is performing from a classified watch and ward to nonperformer similar to the office exposure across the rest of our footprint which i would say is slightly worse than the overall commercial weighted average risk rating and levels of classified and criticized so thats where we are its a relatively small portion we spend a lot of time on it as you can imagine the other good news there is we have less than of rent rolls rolling off in each of the next two years which means that theres probably sometime before real issues if there really is a permanent paradigm shift arise and it gives us some time to work with the borrowers on those properties laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from bernie horn with polaris capital management your line is open bernard r horn q analyst polaris capital management llc hi good morning i had a quick question on just general tone of the portfolio or the behavior of borrowers weve heard from some sectors companies that were speaking to and even some borrowers in the pe space that some of their borrowers are getting very cautious about the future of the economy to the point where theyre actually trying to sell off some assets to pay down debt so i guess the question is are you seeing it seems like youre going in a very heavy into the growth mode potentially before a big economic crisis im not saying its huge but i guess the point is that some borrowers are out there getting more conservative are you seeing any of that type of behavior in new borrowers john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah bernie i think in some sectors we are absolutely and as portfolio managers were doing the same thing if we have opportunities because theres still a lot of private liquidity out there to lower areas in our loan book that we think might be vulnerable in the longterm were taking actions as well so i dont want you to get the sense that were not in full preparedness mode the potential number of outcomes here is wide our base case is still if there is a recession its relatively mild in terms of impact on broad credit but we obviously know that there could be a worse downturn so as i said earlier all of our origination were not pedal down meaning that its loan growth at all costs were taking care of our borrowers in the geographies and sectors in our existing relationships and opportunities we should but were trying to avoid like in real estate were cautious in hotel were cautious and really not doing anything in the office right now and so there are property types were focused on where our growth is multifamily industrial distribution which is still pretty healthy and in ci id say were really careful about cyclical contractors were careful about folks that are exposed to energy costs transportation costs whove been significantly impacted by supply chain disruption whove been impacted actually by labor shortages and with tight labor markets webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 so what we do is we dont put a blanket on everything and put out the red light or the yellow light but our credit folks who are just terrific jason soto our chief credit officer and his team theyre well aware of where there is more vulnerability and its coming through i think in our risk selection which is why a little bit were not projecting the same level of loan growth for the balance of the year we still think there will be decent loan demand but we think as we move closer to whatever this cycle is that therell be less demand because our borrowers will be more cautious and so are we bernard r horn q analyst polaris capital management llc thats terrific detail thanks for that additional commentary because that obviously anticipated my follow up as to where youre being cautious with thanks so much appreciate it john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer
