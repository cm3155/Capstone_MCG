welcome to webster financial corporations first quarter earnings call we appreciate you joining us this morning ill provide remarks on our highlevel results and operations before turning it over to glenn to cover our financial results in greater detail were off to a solid start this year having achieved a number of significant accomplishments both strategically and financially i first want to provide some color around initiatives that solidify websters commitment to our clients communities and colleagues as these have been and continue to be core to our company values in the fourth quarter webster launched the youre home program a special purpose credit program offering down payment assistance and flexible credit requirements to help expand homeownership opportunities for low tomoderate income firsttime homebuyers the youre home program is the most recent component of our broad community investment strategy a multiyear commitment to expanding access to capital providing loans investments technical assistance and financial services to individuals and small businesses in lmi neighborhoods were also launching four new finance labs in the coming weeks in partnership with local nonprofits the webster finance labs initiative provides technology and programming to create financial empowerment opportunities for young people by the end of this year we will have deployed over million into nine labs under this initiative our colleagues share this commitment to service last year webster volunteers gave nearly hours of their time to nearly community organizations across our footprint these are just a few examples of how webster and our colleagues demonstrate our commitment to our values and our communities turning to our financial performance on slide on an adjusted basis for the quarter we generated a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of our adjusted eps was we are pleased to grow client deposits by billion and use those funds to redeem brokered deposits amidst a challenging growth environment for the industry we grew loans at or when adjusting for the transfer of million of loans to held for sale our billion in funded loan originations this quarter were driven by highquality ci cre categories including fund banking and public sector finance and cre and property types with solid operating dynamics our efficiency ratio was in line with the low to mid range we expect to operate in for the year our interest income performance was softer than originally anticipated as a number of factors led to lowerthan expected loan yields and we saw our deposits continue to reprice higher albeit at a moderated rate despite these dynamics we still anticipate that nii for the full year will be in the lower range of the guidance we provided in january assuming loan demand and credit quality of that loan demand cooperate structurally and longer term we should continue to generate returns near the top of our peer group given the strategic advantage provided by our funding profile and business mix and the operating flexibility we have created in terms of our liquidity and capital positions we anticipate the ability to generate a return on assets in the range of and a return on tangible common equity in excess of for the full year and beyond our recently closed acquisition of ametros augments our competitive position on the next slide weve provided the overview of ametros as a reminder of the business fundamentals now that they are officially a subsidiary of webster ametros is a particularly unique and exciting opportunity as the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 company provides a valuable service for its members and provides webster with lowcost fastgrowing deposits that add significant fee income to describe the business in brief ametros administers recipients funds for medical claims settlements via a proprietary technology platform and service teams ametros is already illustrating its growth potential as it has grown to million in deposit balances relative to million in deposit balances when we announced the acquisition in december it is our expectation ametros will grow deposits at cagr over the next five years before considering potential benefits from expanding existing partnerships new market penetration or medical cost inflation slide which many of you are familiar with now highlights our funding diversity and now officially incorporates ametros as you will see on subsequent slides weve combined ametros with hsa bank in a segment weve named healthcare financial services with the segment reporting to our talented president and coo luis massiani for the foreseeable future we will continue to provide business specific performance measures for both ametros and hsa bank before turning it over to glenn let me touch on overall credit and more specifically cre consistent with industry trends we have seen negative risk rating migration and a return to prepandemic credit metrics we continue to proactively monitor our overall loan portfolio and we complete deep dives on targeted segments frequently while trend lines point to continued pressure on credit performance excluding office we havent seen any concentrated or correlated problem areas with respect to any particular geography industry sector or product type on slide we provide incremental information on our commercial real estate portfolio as it continues to be a focal point of investors in a higher for longer interest rate environment our commercial real estate portfolio is diversified by geography and product type is conservatively underwritten ph has continued to perform well from an asset quality perspective in its entirety our commercial real estate portfolio has a weighted average origination ltv of and an amortizing debt service coverage ratio of times classified loans are of the portfolio with nonaccruals of just basis points as rentregulated multifamily lending has been in focus this quarter we provided some of the attributes of our portfolio on this slide as well as you can see in the incremental detail we provide here our modestly sized portfolio is granular was underwritten at conservative ltvs and debt service coverage ratios and has limited maturities in the next two years additionally a majority of the book was underwritten following the housing stability act passed in therefore our expectations for the performance of those properties incorporates the unfavorable effects of this legislation on property cash flows in this category the average loan size is million we have only seven exposures greater than million and our largest rentregulated multifamily loan is now million given the underwriting of the loans and client selection the credit performance of this portfolio has been solid as illustrated by just basis points in classified loans and nonaccruals weve also refreshed statistics on our office exposure on this page where ill point out that we continue to reduce the size of our portfolio were actively working the portfolio given sector pressures i would note that our new york city office exposure is a manageable million in addition to the information here there are two additional slides at the front of the supplement to this presentation that provide significant detail on our overall cre portfolio highlighting the diversity of the portfolio in terms of property type and geography importantly we have been disciplined in terms of hold levels over time as there are relatively few tall trees in terms of singlepoint exposures across our various portfolios our larger exposures have a stronger weighted webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 average risk rating as you would expect and we currently have no classified exposures in the greater than million cre category with that ill turn it over to glenn to cover our financials in more detail glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap and adjusted earnings for the first quarter we reported gaap net income to common holders of million with diluted earnings per share of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and diluted eps of the largest component of the adjustments was ph an addition to the estimated fdic special assessment of million a onetime tax adjustment of million and million in ametros closing costs in addition a securities repositioning loss was more than offset by an msr sale it is notable that there were no sterlingrelated merger charges this quarter and this will continue to be the case next ill review the balance sheet trends beginning on slide total assets were billion at period end up billion from the fourth quarter our security balances were up million relative to the fourth quarter the yield on our portfolio increased basis points linked quarter to via the combination of growth reinvestment of cash flows and million in restructuring executed this quarter loans were up million driven by commercial categories and reflective of opportunities to gain market share while total deposits were flat we grew core deposits billion and retail cds million which was offset by a decline in brokered deposits as john noted and you can see on this slide we have aligned ametros and hsa bank for segment presentation purposes while still providing the same data on hsa bank that we have historically the loan to deposit ratio was in the range of where we expect to operate over the next few quarters borrowings increased billion as we use them for liquidity purposes given the managed decline in brokered deposits capital levels remained strong the common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was both lower than prior quarter primarily as a result of the ametros acquisition tangible book value decreased to per common share reflecting the impact of the ametros acquisition and a small increase in afs security losses in a steady interest rate environment we anticipate million of unrealized security losses would accrete back into the capital annually loan trends were highlighted on slide in total loans were up roughly million or on a linked quarter basis we reclassified million of payroll finance and factoring loans to heldforsale we expect to execute on the sale in the near future without the reclassification loan growth would have been closer to linked quarter or approximately annually growth was driven by commercial real estate where we had the opportunities to add new relationships and lower risk asset classes including million in multifamily and million in general commercial real estate categories the yield on the portfolio was flat relative to prior quarter as a result of a shift in mix offsetting higher loan origination yields floating and periodic loans were of total loans at quarter end we provide additional detail on deposits on slide we grew our core deposits billion and retail cds million this quarter given the strength of our core deposit growth we reduced brokered deposits the net effect was effectively flat total deposits on a linked quarter basis when combined transactional and low cost long duration healthcare financial services deposits compromise of our deposit base our dda balances were down million relative to the prior quarter twothirds of the decline was driven by clients moving excess cash balances to higher yielding money market accounts with the other third related to specific client transaction activity webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 our total cost of deposits was up just basis points to basis points this quarter as the pace of deposit repricing continues to slow for the month of march our deposit cost was basis points increases were the result of clients opting for higher yielding products as well as renewals in the cd portfolio our cumulative cycle to date total deposit beta is now on slide we rolled forward our deposit beta assumptions to incorporate the second quarter during which we expect our cycle to date beta to reach as a result of lag repricing impact and a continued higher rate environment moving to slide we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for the prior period overall adjusted net income was down million relative to the prior quarter net interest income was down million from prior quarter this was a result of higher funding costs and lower day count partially offset by higher earning asset yields adjusted noninterest income was up million adjusted expenses were up million and the provision increased million excluding adjustments our tax rate was this quarter up from in the fourth quarter our efficiency ratio was on slide we highlight net interest income which declined million or linked quarter the decline was related to lower net interest margin and day count the net interest margin was down basis points to basis points as a result of increased funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields interest rate hedges also contributed modestly to the decline we recognized million in cost this quarter versus million last quarter as john highlighted nim was below our expectations as the macro environment made it challenging to grow our higher spread assets that meet our risk criteria our yield on earning assets increased basis points over the prior quarter with loan yields flat and securities portfolio up basis points as previously noted we repositioned million of securities in the first quarter this will improve our securities yield by basis points in the second quarter pace of deposit repricing continues to moderate and was up just basis points total liability costs were up basis points we have provided detail on our hedging program on slide in the supplement of this presentation which reviews the banks asset sensitivity on slide we highlight noninterest income which was up million versus prior quarter on an adjusted basis million of the increase was driven by our healthcare financial services segment with million driven by the seasonal increases and growth in hsa bank and million due to the addition of ametros an additional million of the increase was attributed to a noncash swing in the credit valuation adjustment the remaining drivers were related to boli events commercial loan and other deposit fees noninterest expenses on slide we reported adjusted expenses of million up million from the prior quarter million of the increase came from healthcare financial services with million driven by ametros operating expense and intangibles and million due to seasonality and account growth at hsa bank remaining growth and expenses were related to seasonal increases in payroll tax and benefit costs annual merit and performance based incentives slide details components of our allowance for credit losses which was up relative to prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we incurred a million loan provision of which million was attributable to macro and credit factors and million of which was attributable to loan growth as a result our allowance coverage to loans increased to basis points from basis points last quarter slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets increased million relative to prior quarter with nonperforming loans now representing basis points of total loans commercial webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 classified loans as a percent of commercial loans increased to basis points from basis points as classified loans increased by million on an absolute basis classified loan increase was concentrated in ci portfolio across diverse industries our classified loan ratio remained well below websters prepandemic level net chargeoffs on the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis consistent with last quarters level on slide we maintained strong capital levels all capital levels remain at or above our internal targets our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was our tangible book value was a share ill wrap up my comments on slide with our outlook for the outlook includes the impact of ametros which closed in january and directly impacts deposits interest income fees and expenses we expect loans to grow around for the full year towards the lower end of our prior guide growth will continue to be driven by our commercial business with more of a tilt to ci relative to cre categories we are reiterating our deposit growth in the to range with growth in the commercial bank full relationship deposits retail deposits interlink ametros and corporate deposits we expect net interest income of roughly billion on a nonfte basis which is at the low end of our prior guide for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to the outlook our net interest income assumes two decreases to the fed funds rate with one in september and the other in december noninterest income continues to be forecasted in the range of million to million adjusted expenses continue to be in the range of billion to billion our efficiency ratio is expected to be in the low to mid range we expect an effective tax rate of and of course we will remain prudent managers of capital our longterm common equity tier ratio remains at with that ill turn it over back to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn to follow up on one point in our outlook while we have maintained our longer term common equity tier target i anticipate well run it closer to in the nearterm to mediumterm given the increased uncertainty generated by a higher for longer bias we think wed like to have incremental optionality in our pocket and that would be prudent additionally given higher capital levels in areas for which we see the greatest opportunities for loan growth for the remainder of the year we anticipate the commercial real estate relative to our total capital levels should decline over the next four to six quarters our intent is to bring cre concentration to approximately of tier capital plus reserves with a longerterm target closer to as we approach the billion asset size threshold there are many more industry headwinds and tailwinds as we work our way through but i continue to be very confident in our ability to navigate the current landscape both offensively and defensively well prioritize strong capital levels and disciplined credit management well continue to take care of our clients and deepen those client relationships across business lines we have a diverse funding profile and a loan to deposit ratio in the mid providing us with significant flexibility and optionality on the funding side finally our efficient operating model and unique businesses should allow us to continue to provide better than peer returns consistently over time finally as youre all aware glenn recently informed me and our board of directors of his intent to retire weve kicked off a comprehensive search for his successor in partnership with spencer stuart theres been broad interest in the role and we are confident that we will find a terrific person to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 fill some big shoes glenn will in all likelihood be with us for at least the next earnings call so ill save my farewell remarks for july as all of you know glenn has been an invaluable asset to me and to the bank for more than a decade and he has shined over the last five years through a pandemic a transformational merger and the industry events of last march thank you all for joining us today and eric glenn and i will open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everybody john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i was hoping to start just on the nim and nii if i look at where we are this quarter versus the guide it suggests that at some point this year kind of a material snapback in the overall quarterly cadence of nii i was hoping you could just help me better understand the rest of the year in terms at nii or where you expect that snapback to occur on an nii basis or a nim basis thank you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so let me start and john you can add some color to that i mean i think we look at it a couple of drivers there matt the first being loans and were still guiding toward loan growth so if you think about on average youre probably talking about billion to billion in average loans on a yearoveryear basis and so well get the benefit of that likewise on the investment portfolio well get the full year benefit of the restructuring we did in the fourth quarter and the ph add that we did in the fourth quarter of billion as well as the restructuring we did in the first quarter we continue to see opportunity in the securities portfolio on cash flow basis where well have probably about million a quarter that will reprice well probably pick up basis points on that and then likewise on the fixed rate loan portfolio although it was somewhat softer in the first quarter we think that well probably get about million a quarter on a fixed rate loan portfolio it will probably pick up about basis points on that so those are the tailwinds on the opposite side we continue to see pressure on deposits and so i think our deposit cost as you saw in the first quarter creeped up by basis points it was more moderate than weve seen in previous quarters but i think as you look through the cycle you would expect to see deposit costs continue to peak in the second and third quarter and so that will detract from some of the gain that we get on both the loan growth the investment and the repricing of fixed rate assets webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah matt i mean i would just say obviously were trying desperately not to overpromise and under deliver thats not our style over seven years the first quarter was interesting in that we had backended loan growth we had very little loan growth in sponsor and specialty were starting to see some more activity there so our loan yields were lower the average loans were lower and some of our expectations of repricing of the portfolio that glenn mentioned that we had expected in this higher for longer environment didnt occur because we had a much lower level of prepay and refinance and repricing activity in the book we also had a shortterm mix shift in deposits which we think will rebound a bit and we get the full benefit of hsa and ametros going forward so i think if you add what glenn just gave specifically with respect to opportunities for higher nii from the securities portfolio the moves we made from a more favorable deposit mix and from standard loan growth where we see there being more contribution from our generally higher yielding loans thats why we havent moved that besides going to the low end of the original range we provided thats why weve kind of said we think were going to be approximately around that billion if dynamics continue to change wildcard on prepayments and other things obviously will mix up the guidance but its our best view right now quite frankly matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i appreciate all that and the next one is just on credit allinall the credit metrics look pretty solid still but the quarteroverquarter change was notable youd mentioned there was nothing specific that was driving everything but i appreciate if theres any sort of common threads particularly in the ci book and then john youd mentioned kind of getting to a cre concentration over time does something similar hold true for the reserve which looks a little light versus your billion bank peers as well john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean theres a whole bunch to unpack there so i would say from a credit perspective you kind of nailed it if you look at all of the credit metrics annualized chargeoffs in the quarter are really sort of kind of in line with what youre seeing in the industry similar to what we had last quarter the percentage increase in classified and nonaccruals looked high but if you look at our absolute numbers theyre still below what webster bank reported prepandemic at december so i think youre right to say the absolute levels are still not kind of eye popping we are seeing negative risk rating migration and i think its consistent with those who have reported thus far and i think as i mentioned in my comments i think we believe therell be more pressure not less pressure on credit as we work our way through whatever this i think pretty modest cycle will be we havent really seen we had a kind of a broad contribution on the classifieds and the nonperformers actually skewing a little bit more towards ci and cre i think weve been really out in front on cre but the only way i can characterize i would say theres the only industry segment that we have seen some negative trending in is healthcare services but we think fundamentally that industry and area has really good fundamental dynamics going forward otherwise its kind of idiosyncratic oneoffs so an equipment finance deal a middle market transaction a healthcare services deal a food and beverage company so really just kind of oneoff and only a handful of loans that actually drove the increase in those categories so were not sounding the alarm everywhere jasons doing a terrific job of doing deep dives so i really kind of just think its a broad deterioration consistent what you see weve seen throughout the industry with respect to the cre concentration i think your calculation matt ph what l you do you have us in the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 range or something if we keep that portfolio generally flat and we do have some payoffs and some rolloffs coming up as we move forward still giving us an opportunity to originate healthy really good structured commercial real estate loans which by the way were making the best loans weve made now in nonoffice and rent regulated multifamily because there arent as many market participants so were getting better yields and better structure but if you see us accrete capital back that we lost in the ametros acquisition and you see us managing that the six quarter ph target is not significantly difficult to imagine while were growing the balance sheet i do think over time the reality is over the next three years as we start to approach category four well have to continue to have commercial real estate be less of a concentration overall i do think over time looking at capital levels a combination of capital levels and reserves those things will probably tick up i think we can do that in an orderly fashion given the makeup of our balance sheet we dont have a lot of consumer unsecured we dont have cards so its not just the fact that were in this new category i think its also the makeup of the balance sheet so i think going forward its not going to be a segment earnings but youll probably see us evolve from a capital and reserve perspective as we move forward depending on the makeup of the balance sheet matthew breese q analyst stephens inc perfect i appreciate all the color ill leave it there thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with keefe bruyette woods please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc john a question on normalized chargeoffs youve kind of been in this basis point basis point range how do you view this environment in the context of normal john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean i think in the benign credit environment leading up to the pandemic i think we were in the basis point range give or take the last few quarters to be completely transparent obviously we had a decent portion of the chargeoffs were related to proactive balance sheet management loan sales this quarter the vast majority of the chargeoffs were what i would call kind of liquidated chargeoffs they happened they werent related to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 asset sales so i do think that theres more pressure on credit i think anything below basis points in terms of cycle basis points in commercial its still absolutely absorbable by our cash flows and our earnings power i think what i would tell you right now is were seeing across the industry the beginning of what i believe will be a shallow credit correction and the way we look at things going forward chris i still think our provision that the street has for the full year its kind of what were building in even looking at our risk rating migration and our classified assets and our nonaccruals in the outcomes of the loss given defaults on loans that may be troubled so this basis points i would say is slightly higher it doesnt portend to have a huge credit correction could it go higher in any one quarter i think youve heard a lot of people say in this earnings cycle when you have a large commercial loan portfolio that thing can bounce around a little bit because you really cant control what happens and if you have a couple of larger chargeoffs that could bounce around from that basis points but i kind of feel like were in heightened alert the ultimate overall metrics still are better than prepandemic or around prepandemic and its a question of whether or not this is deeper so could you see chargeoffs go higher in certain quarters yes would i be surprised if chargeoffs were lower next quarter i wouldnt be so i hope that gives you just some color of the way were thinking christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats good thank you for that and i guess my followup would be you guys have been early on loan sales didnt do anything really meaningful this quarter to get to that cre target that youre talking about is there a scenario where you would accelerate that achievement john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think its just an economic exercise weve got some great partnerships we have some interesting agency eligible loans in our portfolio depending on the interest rate environment and what happens theres opportunity to do that without taking significant hits were looking at everything and obviously we want to make sure that our clients the ones where we have full relationships know that theyre banking with us and we can continue to support them with respect to nonstrategic loans that may have good market value and easily salable we obviously have some levers to pull we could have in this quarter done that we just didnt think the economics made sense because there wasnt poor credit quality it was just a question of kind of the earnings and the yields on those loans so i think my short answer would be yes as we execute that repositioning and we move forward and we dont want to jolt the income statement either from having lower earning assets you will see proactive selective and opportunistic loan sales as we move forward particularly if the interest rate environment moderates as we head into christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks thanks john john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please go ahead webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning and glenn let me echo johns congratulations on your welldeserved retirement glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thank you mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co glenn i in your modeling i guess im curious how different would your full year nii estimate be if we have no fed rate cuts this year glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp not really so we have one cut in september and december right now and i think the difference mark if i just kept it flat is a total of million so its not really relevant mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then secondly on the office book it looks like youve got about million of office loan maturities this year i guess im curious did the borrowers have anywhere else to go or are you sort of forced to refinance for them and do you have i assume at this point pretty good line of sight into whats happening with those individual credits do you see any problems on the horizon with that book john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean obviously its a book were looking at significantly its the area where youve had the biggest decline in valuation we give you the stats mark that say we start out from a pretty good loan to value perspective pretty good debt service youve seen a small migration in the classifieds for us weve done a really good job of taking the book down from billion to billion over the last six or seven quarters i think now what were doing is focusing on kind of how we deal with were dealing with maturities there the way were dealing with maturities across the entire cre book and consistent with what youve heard from others during this reporting cycle weve had opportunities weve been able to refi some there is i think you probably qualify pretty well that theres not an immediate source of refinancing away from us quite frankly for most of these loans unless they have unique circumstances so we had a couple of payoffs a couple of sales in most cases where were doing on the maturities shorter term extensions obviously you cant people will say is the industry kicking the can forward i guess at some level they are but we cant kick the can forward as an occregulated bank so what were doing is making sure that theres debt service in place at market or near market rates were making sure that we get kind of bootstrap collateral we get debt service coverage reserves we get guarantees for periods of time so thats basically what we have i think we have of our loans now have some sort of credit enhancement either through a guarantee or a debt service reserve and so were just kind of working our way through that portfolio webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 and i think were fortunate that our overall portfolio is relatively small more than half of it is class a its geographically diverse its not all metro and so so far and im knocking on wood here weve been able to kind of work with borrowers through it and despite the precipitous drop in valuation that youre reading about and we see some of that the owners of these properties most of them feel like they still have equity in the building and so theyre willing to work with us to make sure we have a solid performing secured loan moving forward mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks mark operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc john i want to start on the loan outlook so for the banks that are reported this quarter most ceos are sound like a bit more optimistic citing improved pipelines customer sentiment et cetera and you guys are taking the range down to the lower end not a massive change but youre pushing to the lower end what really changed versus last quarter and are you not also seeing an improvement in pipelines john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp oh a good question so i think if you look at the first quarter we had loan growth which is kind of in line with that and youre right first quarters usually a seasonally low origination quarter and obviously consistent with everyone else loan demand was sort of muted at the beginning of the year and then we moved some loans off which we can talk about later with respect to payroll finance and factoring into heldforsale i think as we go forward our sponsor and specialty book steve which as you know has been kind of a crown jewel of ours and as weve seen the beginnings of green shoots and pipeline build there but its been slower activity in that sponsor space and so i think that was one reason we talked just a second ago with matt about commercial real estate and the fact that were going to be a little bit more selective and careful as we move forward in that segment both with respect to the kind of inherent risks and the optics of our concentration levels there and what i would say is definitely things getting better i think the second half could be good could we outperform on the yes but as i mentioned earlier we dont like to overpromise and underdeliver we were disappointed this quarter by the nii and i think we looked at the makeup of our portfolio went to our business webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 line leaders and thought was the right guide im hoping that we can outperform that were seeing better pipelines were not seeing as robust pipelines but i think theres reason to be optimistic for the second half steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks and then for my follow up so on the margin i know it came in a little bit weaker this quarter a lot of moving pieces are all wholesale funding et cetera for you glenn do you think this is a bottom for the margin this quarter and how do you think about nim trending before we get any rate cuts and then maybe if we do get rate cuts thanks glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so i think so steve i think margin will be relatively flat quarteroverquarter net interest income will improve quarteroverquarter but i think the margin where we are right now will probably be relatively flat i do on our forecast and the assumptions that i laid out before whether its loan growth or the investment portfolio the repricing stuff i do think that our margin will get to like the 345ish by the end of the year somewhere around there potential upside depending on how quick we can reduce deposit costs but thats how were thinking of it right now so you can think of ph a four year average or a full year average margin somewhere around if you just look at the full year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and i know you said in response to marks question whether the cuts happened or not very material but in a cut scenario given interlink some of the higher cost deposits you have would that benefit the margin incrementally towards the end of the year if we get rate cuts is that we should think about that glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah it would i mean i think right now we see deposit costs like i said peaking in the second quarter between the second and third quarter and then coming down a big driver that i talked about this on the last call is of our billion in deposits about are sort of had the same characteristic of interlink so they reprice pretty quickly so those are things like public funds those are things like interlink and theres some other products there so you can think about billion that i would consider sort of high data products right now but then they reprice down pretty quickly so that would be the first tranche to go when the fed cuts we think that the deposit beta on the way down is say 20plus percent on the way down so i think and thats reflective of like a three month pipeline that the core deposits have to cycle through and so you will see that when the fed starts cutting you will see that our deposit costs come down the other thing id point out is were starting to see the industry pull back a little and weve reduced if i look at our cd rates for example we had billion come due in the first quarter that repriced higher by basis points as i look forward theres another billion in the second another billion in the third quarter those are going to be neutral by the third quarter it might even be accretive to us because one weve reduced our rate and weve also reduced the term and so i think that the drag from the cds repricing will be behind us beginning in the second quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 okay got it thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone i wanted to touch on expenses so you guys kept the guide which implies a decent ramp from the current run rate i know you guys still have to fully run rate ametros im just wondering if that is conservative or just some color on whats the expense pressure there if for the midpoint of the guide john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah thanks casey i think youre right we got a full year of the full quarter of ametros moving forward so it just annualized i think were keeping i guess to answer your question upfront its a conservative number but its a conservative number based on the fact that were building out our program and our work streams to make sure as we move towards million that we continue to invest in areas where we think its important to make sure that were beefing up our control functions and compliance and others were also continuing to invest in treasury payment capabilities digital channels to make sure that were giving our clients all of the experiences that they deserve weve talked often about the fact that were starting from a mid efficiency ratio a full lower than most of our peers and i think a lot of folks will need to continue to invest particularly the ones in the billion to billion category and we think that low starting point of efficiency gives us some flexibility do we have opportunities to either switch up timing of expenses we do do we have opportunities to continue to look at the makeup of our business we talked incessantly over eight quarters about while weve liked all of the various business lines we had that there were some that had maybe were too small to really help us and we would reposition capital and you saw us do that with mortgage warehouse and you saw what glenn talked about moving the payroll finance and factoring balances to held for sale and us moving away from that business we do have other opportunities to continue to refine our business and reallocate capital that would also give us some relief on cost pressures so i think its a realistic number given our plan as we move forward i would say its conservative in that we do have levers to pull should the top line not play out the way we think it will casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks and then just wanted to circle back on the loan growth so if im understanding you correctly cre is kind of run in place the loan pipeline is sounds okay but cre drove a ton of growth this quarter its of the loans so that means to hit for the rest of the year the rest of the portfolio is going to have to average high singledigit pace of growth it just doesnt seem like that the pipeline supports that and just some color there on what buckets youre looking to grow to pick up the slack for cre webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah fair question casey so obviously as you know in these businesses its an aircraft carrier right so youll probably see healthy cre originations in as well as we sort of work through the pipeline and we continue to kind of position ourselves and thats why we said kind of over the next six quarters youd see that change in the balance sheet so i dont think youll see a complete ph hole if you will from a commercial real estate perspective we do have increasing activity in our sponsor specialty business which has been historically a highgrowth cagr growth business over time and youre starting to read about more private equity activity and were starting to see people gear up we have fund banking which is a lever we can pull and that were really doing well there from a strategic perspective not only growing highquality nice yielding assets but getting deposits and other elements there we have a pipeline in the middle market weve got our abl and equipment finance businesses and so weve got i think enough levers to pull that when we sit there and look at the profile we think that to the extent cre slows in the second half of the year that we have plenty of levers to pull youve heard me say over and over again in a normalized environment were a commercial growth and weve done it over eight years consistently from a cagr perspective this is a unique environment weve seen fits and starts in overall loan demand and now we are layering on top of that kind of a desire to mute cre growth compared to the rest but as you said that high singledigit loan growth in the other categories doesnt scare us a ton as long as the market cooperates and by the way you know that were risk managers first right we really feel good about this bank were a bank that has even with the nim compression but really helping nim at weve got a efficiency ratio a ph roa and a roe and so were going to make sure that were making the right short term moves even if it means theres a quarter where we fall short and i think our longterm growth targets and objectives are completely attainable so our plan were not being blind casey going into saying hey were going to freeze cre and were going to still have loan growth i think youre going to see cre kind of taper with respect to its growth trajectory and we feel pretty confident about the other asset classes and our ability to grow those loans casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 hey good morning maybe just switching over to deposits with dda balances declining this quarter do you think that were near the bottom here or is there still some more diminishment you expect out of the base and where do you think deposit growth comes from to hit those targets going forward glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so let me so hi jared its glenn so i think we did see an acceleration in the first quarter of customers sweeping excess cash into money market deposit accounts but we do if i look at my forecast my forecast is has basically flattened that out so i think i would think of the second quarter a billion on dda thats basically flattened out for the year as far as growth the drivers and the guidance suggests billion to billion in deposit growth at the low and the high range so some of the key drivers are going to be in ametros obviously so say million on the low end million on high end has between million and million over on the course of the year interlink id probably say about billion will grow between now and the end of the year we still continue to see cd growth we saw million in the quarter i think for the full year were thinking its probably about million and then the rest of that would be probably in wholesale funding or wholesale the wholesale channels jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats good color thanks and then could you just give a little more color on the credit valuation moves that we saw this quarter and what drove that and how you guys could try to plan that going forward glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so thats driven by primarily by rates so that you saw the reduction last quarter as rates from the third to the fourth quarter came down and then you see it from the fourth quarter to first quarter sort of a snapback on that so thats its pretty much driven by rates these are this is the valuation part of our customer derivative book right and so theres been some noise back and forth over the last couple of quarters its hard to forecast you can tie it to rates and i would say if rates are stable right now youd probably expect it to be relatively stable as rates go down it could we could have a little bit of a hit but not nothing like we saw from the third to the fourth quarter where it was million ph from memory jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thanks for that and congratulations on the retirement looking forward to still talking to you over the next quarter or so glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks jared operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc given the comments on capital and eventually moving that cre to tier plus reserve number lower than even does that mean that buybacks are off the table for the foreseeable future or do you think you could restart once you get to that cet1 level and as we think about that level as well should we think about that as a more permanent target now given that you want to eventually get to that number or is it just a function of moving up reserves slowing the cre loan growth and then you can bring that cet1 number back down to john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think for the foreseeable future is the target just given the overall dynamics of us and the marketplace and some of the uncertainty from a credit perspective so i think were unlikely to buy back shares during unless theres some other specific change we generate a lot of capital every year given our profitability metrics so i do think as we did from the closing of the moe years ago or just over years ago for that level and were moving forward and were generating capital and we dont have a good internal use of that capital we will return it to shareholders in the form of dividends or more likely buyback given the fact that we feel comfortable with our dividend level so i think you could see that restart as we get into and as our capital level gets to so thats kind of our view right now obviously weve talked that from ma perspective were not really focused at all on inorganic growth right now we would love to do more transactions like the ametros transactions which brings lowcost deposits and fees but right now our focus is on working through generating and delivering on our guidance taking care of our customers making sure we work through credit building capital back up to and then well be back to our normal kind of capital management plan in manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc very helpful and then thanks for the detail on the rentregulated multifamily exposure i see that most balances were originated post but can you talk about your comfort level with the credits and the level of reserving for the or so that was originated pre2019 and are there any details that you can share on that portfolio john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah those are really small generally as we said granular small balance accounts average million in exposure were seeing kind of the metrics we actually did a deep dive and try to look at the credit metrics the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 performance the debt service and the ltv comparatively between the ones that were underwritten before and after and were not seeing any differentiation in performance so the entirety of the book is kind of performing with very low levels of classified and criticized assets i think one of the key points to make not only on our rentregulated multifamily but on our multifamily book in general is that we underwrite to inplace market rents so were not counting on there being rent increases at the end of the day to ultimately service the debt and that has set us well it doesnt mean that higher noi i mean higher operating costs cant impact noi but we havent seen any degradation in the portfolio so were looking right now at a similar portfolio construct and performance between pre and post2019 underwrites manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and no major degradation in ltvs there either john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp no we havent seen it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good morning guys maybe first just changing gears here looking at the fee income guide just curious if theres something in the million core number that you did in the first quarter that you expect to moderate or you think that thats a decent number to grow off of in glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so i think on that we were i think we still feel good like i said in the guidance the million to million we did have a strong quarter i think the guidance implies a range of million to million and some of the tailwinds if i just sort of break it out we still will get the benefit the full year benefit of ametros which will add say million million beginning in the second quarter and then well see increases in loan related fees deposit servicing fees and stuff like that throughout the year some of the headwinds that well see are well see probably lower hsa interchange which sort of peaks in the first quarter but i think all in all we still feel good about the guide and i would expect that you would expect that it would be in the million million range daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thanks glenn understood and then maybe just a followup on the conversation on deposits you mentioned youre budgeting for noninterestbearing to stay relatively flat for the rest of the year if that were not to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 be the case if we did see some kind of decline in those balances as the year progressed how would you expect to go out and would you go out and fill the void with additional funding via wholesale channels or would you just curious how you would approach that scenario and if theres a glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah no i think daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc kind of some kind of indiscernible glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah from a funding gap the answer is yes i mean you its depending on new loan growth probably you get some additional mix and youd probably see a move as weve seen in the past like money market deposits so it definitely increases your cost the other thing ill point out ph john is that with ametros and hsa ametros is at or basis points and weve come out of the box theyve come out of the box pretty strong on that we closed at million were already at million and its just basically two months and so we expect we think thats going to grow pretty good as well and likewise with hsa so i think theres a lot of as john pointed out in the opening comments when you look at our diverse funding profile theres a lot of levers we can pull short answer is if we saw some more pressure on dda we probably use wholesale funding the last thing id point out on ametros by the way and it is in this slide is that in that business we have about billion of committed funds in the future so those are contractual settlements so if you think of that business theres billion in a pipeline thats over years and years but its thats the committed funds to that business and i think that represents a pretty significant opportunity for us john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah and i would just again i think im probably saying the same thing glenn said but what we saw in the first quarter was less ddas out creating funding ph holes but ddas to higheryielding accounts internally so we didnt really it didnt create a funding ph hole it was just unfortunately higher cost deposits daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thanks for all the color appreciate it guys operator your next question comes from the line of ph bernie vongizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning john in the beginning of the call you noted you expect an roa of and a roatce of in and beyond its similar to the adjusted results this quarter is that how we should also think about this as a throughthecycle return target and if you can elaborate on any underlying macro assumptions behind that john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean i think if you just take kind of where our guidance is right now kind of thats the output right and the reason we talk about those return metrics is that when we announced the merger with sterling three years ago we thought that structurally this is what this company can generate with respect to returns and interestingly nothing in our original assumptions about the macro environment when we did the deal has come true weve seen a precipitous change in fed funds unprecedented weve seen banking crises weve seen pressures on liquidity weve seen outflows of deposits and through that all weve continued to post those kind of high teens roatc sic roatce and kind of a to roa obviously this quarter it was down a little but if we look at our modeling and we sensitize to credit performance given our efficient operating model and our funding sources like those are our targets and weve been able to post those targets for the last nine quarters since the merger closed and those remain our targets and what could hurt that would be things like a more significant credit crisis something unexpected in deposit prices and other inflows and outflows but if you look at our modeling and you look at our history we think that kind of were geared up to be able to deliver those returns through cycles bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you for that and just separately i appreciate the additional cre slides in the deck this quarter in your latest 10q i believe you disclosed the cre office reserves of nearly million just wondering how is that tracking as of ph john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp ph we disclosed it first where we those reserves have moved up their of the traditional office portfolio now i think last quarter they were glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp anybody there operator the next question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker with seaport please go ahead webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah hi thanks good morning and glenn i just john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc ph wanted to say congrats to you just if we could jump back to ci thats where you had a big jump in nonperformers can you help us think about going from million to million in nonperformers in the quarter where were seeing that jump where any details is it sponsor specialty finance is it abl how much is mixed any color you can share with us there thanks john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah laurie i will try we at a company our size we certainly dont talk about specific credits but there were say four credits in the ci we had a contractor healthcare services a food and restaurant company one retail cre thats sort of the representation across it again i think i try and look at the macro picture obviously ph jason is looking at the micro picture to see whether theres any correlated risk so if i told you they were five sponsor deals in a particular segment i would be transparent and tell you that and say were concerned about it and give you more portfolio detail but these were really idiosyncratic across five different categories across our ci and one cre deal and again i think the critical element is that our nonaccrual loans if you look at peers that have reported so far or you look at websters nonaccrual levels pre pandemic ph where we still havent approached the benign credit environment level there and im not portending that we wont because i said well continue to have pressure but nothing weve seen has suggested that theres a pocket of weakness poor underwriting asset class business line or geography that has us particularly concerned were really reviewing the whole portfolio so i would say its idiosyncratic across industries across sectors and business lines in the quarter and a move back to a more normal level of non performers laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc got it and then just especially the sponsor specialty book how much is that nonperforming john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp wait can you repeat the question laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah the sponsor specialty book what is the nonperforming rate there or dollar amount there the billion book webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp about about about laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc okay okay great and then just going back to margin here do you have the spot margin and then can you just comment a little bit in terms of fhlb borrowings i was thinking that the ametros acquisition you would probably be paying that down thats costing can you just share with us glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc i guess what youre thinking there thank you very much glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so the spot nim at the end of the quarter was exactly where we were for the full quarter so say spot deposit costs i said on the call basis points so up basis point from where we were for the quarter and loans down basis points so ph basis points and then with respect to fhlb i mean part of the dynamic there laurie is that weve paid down or weve let expire brokered cds and so the fhlb borrowings allow us to be a little more flexible than winding up broker cds returns and stuff like that and so we can tap that resource in order to fund any shortfalls and things like that so i think thats the way i would think about it operator at this time there are no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to john ciulla for closing remarks please go ahead john r ciulla chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you very much eric i appreciate everyone joining us this morning have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes todays call thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect your lines webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 disclaimer the
