capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the fourth quarter capital one earned billion or per common share for the full year capital one earned billion or per share included in eps for the quarter were two small adjusting items which are outlined on the slide net of these adjusting items earnings per share for the quarter was full year adjusted earnings per share was in addition to the adjusting items in the quarter we recorded an equity investment gain of million or per share related to our equity stake in snowflake for the full year the investment gain was million or around per share capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 turning to slide i will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail in the fourth quarter we released million of allowance primarily in our card business economic assumptions underlying our allowance included unemployment of around at the end of and the impacts of the billion stimulus package passed in december the release was driven by the strong credit performance we have observed and by the new stimulus bill in our allowance we continue to assume that the relationship between the economic metrics and credit quickly reverts to a historical norm and weve added significant additional qualitative factors for covidrelated uncertainty in our commercial business we charged off certain energy loans and released allowance for the specific reserves that were previously established for those loans turning to slide you can see the allowance coverage levels declined modestly from the prior quarters across our segments but remained well above prepandemic levels our domestic card coverage is now at while our branded card portfolio coverage is recall that the difference between these metrics is driven by loss sharing agreements in our partnership portfolios coverage in our consumer and commercial businesses also remained elevated at and respectively moving to slide ill discuss our liquidity position you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was well above the regulatory requirement our liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity declined slightly from the third quarter to end the year at approximately billion including about billion in cash driven by continued strong deposits turning to slide you can see that our net interest margin increased basis points quarteroverquarter to the increase was largely driven by higher card loan revenue margin as strong credit results led to lower suppression the impact of third and fourth quarter deposit pricing actions and a modest decline in our cash balance which was partially offset by lower yields on cash and securities lastly turning to slide i will cover our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the fourth quarter up basis points from the third quarter and basis points higher than a year ago we continue to estimate that our cet1 capital need is around which includes a buffer over our capital requirements under the scb framework of as we close out we have approximately basis points or around billion of capital in excess of our cet1 target following the latest stress test results released by the federal reserve last month and in light of the strong capital position i just described we expect to restore our quarterly dividend back to per share in the first quarter pending board approval our board of directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to billion of the companys common stock inclusive of share repurchase capacity of up to approximately million in the first quarter based on the feds current trailing fourquarter average earnings rule the timing and amount of stock repurchase activity will be informed by our outlook on the economy as well as the actual forecasted levels of capital earnings and growth and with that ill turn the call over to rich richard d fairbank chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 thanks scott as i think everyone on this call knows scott shared with me in november that he would be leaving capital one to join a tech startup while he will be here through march this will be scotts last earnings call so i want to take a moment and thank you scott for giving so much of your life to capital one over this past decade including the last five years as our cfo youve built strong relationships with our shareholders and across the investment community and youve always brought their external perspectives to our work inside of capital one youve been a key adviser and partner for me and for the board and a strong leader in our company im particularly grateful for the legacy youve built transforming finance technology strengthening processes and controls building a great team of talented leaders including your successor andrew young we will miss you and im sure you will continue to do great things with that let me turn to our domestic card business exceptional credit performance was the biggest driver of domestic card financial results in the quarter the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear and a basis point improvement from the sequential quarter the 30plus delinquency rate at quarterend was basis points better than the prior year the delinquency rate was up basis points from the linked quarter consistent with typical seasonal patterns fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by billion yearoveryear driven by the allowance release that scott discussed and lower chargeoffs several factors are driving continued credit strength consumers are behaving cautiously spending less saving more and paying down debt these behaviors have been amplified by the cumulative effects of unusually large government stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry our own longstanding resilience choices put us in a strong position going into the pandemic and our strategic investments in digital technology and transformation are paying off in enhanced capabilities and underwriting that are powering our performance and response to the pandemic strikingly strong consumer credit has persisted throughout even after the expiration of several parts of the cares act uncertainty about future credit trends remains high especially in the context of an evolving pandemic that is difficult to predict as scott discussed that uncertainty informs our allowance for credit loss we believe that each incremental month of favorable credit reduces the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact at the end of the fourth quarter domestic card ending loan balances were down billion or yearover year driven by three factors cautious consumer behavior reduced spending and demand for new credit and drove payment rates to historically high levels our marketing pullbacks at the outset of the downturn put additional pressure on loan balances and we moved a partnership portfolio to heldforsale in the third quarter excluding the impact of the move to heldforsale ending loans declined about fourth quarter average loans declined yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis the expected seasonal ramp drove ending loans up by about purchase volume continued to rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic for the full year purchase volume was down in fourth quarter purchase volume was essentially flat compared to the prioryear quarter that compares to a yearoveryear decline of about in the first weeks of the pandemic capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 quarterly purchase volume increased from the sequential quarter consistent with the expected seasonality and the continued rebound despite the rebound purchase volume growth is still down compared to the double digit growth we were seeing before the pandemic fourth quarter revenue declined yearoveryear as a result of the decrease in average loans partially offset by higher revenue margin the revenue margin was up basis points yearoveryear to largely driven by two factors strong credit drove lower revenue suppression and yearoveryear net interchange revenue in the numerator of the margin is essentially flat while average loan balances the denominator of the margin calculation are down noninterest expense was down million or from the fourth quarter of last year largely driven by our choice to pull back on domestic card marketing when the pandemic hit total company marketing trends are largely driven by domestic card fourth quarter marketing for the total company was down yearoveryear on a sequentialquarter basis total company marketing increased significantly in the fourth quarter looking ahead future marketing will be impacted by how things play out with the pandemic and the economy in the midst of the pandemic were finding opportunities and we are leaning into them these opportunities are enhanced by our tech transformation the ultimate level of our marketing will depend on our continuing real time assessment of the marketplace slide summarizes fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business driven by our auto business ending loans increased yearoveryear average loans grew for the fourth quarter and for the full year when the covid downturn began we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient assets we believe that several factors drove our growth the auto market rebound has been stronger for larger franchise dealers the part of the market where were focused our digital products and services drove growth in directtoconsumer originations and growth with dealers who want to provide a lowtouch car buying experience in response to social distancing and our dealer relationship strategy put us in a strong position to grow highquality auto loans fourth quarter auto originations were down yearoveryear competition picked up late in the third quarter and continued to increase in the fourth quarter fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear driven by the stimulusdriven surge in deposits in the second quarter average deposits were up for the fourth quarter and up for the full year our average deposit interest rate decreased basis points yearoveryear and basis points from the linked quarter as we reduced deposit pricing in response to the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics fourth quarter consumer banking revenue increased from the prioryear quarter annual revenue was up both increases were driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits annual growth was negatively impacted by differences in the timing of federal reserve rate cuts preceding our deposit pricing reductions non interest expense in consumer banking was up yearoveryear fourth quarter provision for credit losses improved by million yearoveryear driven by lower chargeoffs and a modest allowance release in our auto business fourth quarter credit results in our auto business remain unusually strong even after seasonal linkedquarter increases of basis points in the auto chargeoff rate and basis points in the delinquency rate yearoveryear the chargeoff rate improved basis points to and the delinquency rate improved basis points to capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 strong auto credit is the result of several factors in addition to the same general drivers of domestic card credit strength auto credit also benefited from very strong auction values and our auto forbearance is having a temporary positive impact particularly on delinquency rates weve provided updated auto forbearance information on appendix slide we expect auto credit metrics to increase from their unusually low levels as auction prices normalize and the temporary impacts of covid forbearance play out moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business fourth quarter ending loan balances were up yearoveryear driven by growth in selected ci and cre specialties average loans were also up for the fourth quarter and for the full year quarterly average deposits increased from the fourth quarter of and annual average deposits grew in as middle market customers continued to bolster their liquidity fourth quarter revenue was up from the prioryear quarter annual revenue was up for the year annual revenue growth from higher loan and deposit volumes and higher noninterest income was partially offset by lower net interest margin noninterest expense for the quarter increased by yearoveryear provision for credit losses improved by million compared to the fourth quarter of the allowance release that scott discussed was partially offset by higher chargeoffs largely related to our oil and gas portfolio our oil and gas exposure declined yearoveryear weve provided a breakout of our oil and gas portfolio composition and reserves on appendix slide the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate for the quarter was the criticized performing loan rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked quarters to driven by downgrades in our commercial real estate portfolio the criticized nonperforming loan rate rose modestly from the prioryear quarter to ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results and how were positioned for the future its not a surprise that the pandemic shaped our results for the full year total company loan balances declined annual revenue was essentially flat including million in gains on our snowflake investment noninterest expense was down with a decline in marketing and relatively flat operating expense provision for credit losses increased by billion and earnings per share rebounded from negative territory early in the year to for the full year down significantly from three key themes are evident in our results the pandemic pressured topline loan balances and revenue particularly in the first half of the year on the bottom line strikingly strong credit resulted in a return to positive trajectory and record profitability in the second half of the year and our longstanding strategic choices put us in a strong position to respond to both the nearterm challenges and the emerging opportunities turning first to the nearterm challenges domestic card loan balances declined sharply as cautious consumers stimulus and widespread industry forbearance drove historically high payment rates and reduced demand lower loan balances put pressure on revenue efficiency and scale the operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments was it was excluding snowflake gains the flip side of this topline pressure was exceptionally strong consumer credit performance which drove two consecutive quarters of record earnings in the second half of and strong second half earnings coupled with a smaller balance sheet enabled us to increase our cet1 ratio to today weve announced our intent to raise the quarterly dividend to its prior level of per share subject to board approval and we also discussed our plan for up to billion of share repurchases which our board has capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 already approved throughout we have been well served by the choices we made before the downturn began since our founding days weve hardwired resilience into the choices weve made on credit capital and liquidity through good times and bad as a result we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends a fortified balance sheet and deep experience in successfully navigating through prior periods of stress including the great recession our investments to transform our technology and how we work and our efforts to drive the company to digital are paying off our transformation is powering our response to the downturn and putting us in a strong position for emerging opportunities as the pandemic plays out pulling way up despite the pressures of the pandemic in the near term nothing has changed about where we think our businesses are headed or the longterm strategic opportunities that are being created as sweeping digital change continues to transform banking as we manage through the nearterm challenges we also continue to focus on the things that create longterm value when delivered and sustained over time continuing to transform our technology from the ground up capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth generating positive operating leverage and improving efficiency and managing capital efficiently and effectively including significant capital distribution and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp thanks rich scott let me add my personal thanks for all the coaching and leadership its been a pleasure to work with you over the years and i wish you all the success as you go forward and now well start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup question and if you have any followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call keith please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon everybody and scott congratulations and andrew i think when you look back at scott leaving you with a billion reserve is probably the best gift he could give you i wanted to talk a little bit about that when we look versus day one the reserve is now up billion im curious when we look at the current credit metrics what do you think the scenarios would have to be to actually really utilize that reserve over a lifetime richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey rick thanks for your kind words and i appreciate both rich and jeff saying such nice things its been honestly just a privilege to be at this company and its certainly a tough place to leave but let me turn to your question in terms of the allowance youre right that when you look at our coverage levels versus our current level of losses and delinquencies theres a big gap and i would just point out that that is because right now our allowance is built to absorb a very wide range of outcomes which is sensible given kind of the circumstances that we are in at the moment and so i think that the biggest driver of where the allowance might go and what might drive releases is frankly just certainty and narrowing down the range of possible outcomes i think could come from things like macroeconomic factors like unemployment or pandemicspecific variables like broader rollouts of the vaccine reduced restrictions on peoples movements and activities and things like that so to me it feels like that certainty is more likely to happen over time versus a step function so i think well see the allowance kind of play out in measured ways over time richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and looking forward to seeing you in the bay area jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 thanks and congratulations scott i guess i have a question on marketing expense and sort of the efficiency ratio targets that you guys had outlined some time ago when we look at the marketing expense it seems like run rate wise were back to levels on a quarterly basis can you guys actually exceed that going forward if theres opportunity in the marketplace and then as far as the efficiency ratio is concerned how long before we can get back to the target that you had outlined rich richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so sanjay good evening we are not making specific guidance about marketing as you know while there are certain things that are sort of fixed mostly fixed about our marketing expenditures a lot of it is based on real time assessment of prospects for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace but let me just kind of pull up and talk about our journey this year with respect to marketing we pulled back early in the crisis but have since increased marketing spend as you saw in q4 and as expected the increase from q3 was meaningfully higher than typical seasonal patterns right now we are seeing opportunities to invest we continue to invest in our brand and our national banking strategy and in our card business were leaning in where we see signs of strength and we feel pretty good about our origination opportunities and these are enhanced by our tech transformation as well so were keeping a very watchful eye on the marketplace but we do see opportunities and were investing in them and with respect to efficiency we still believe that were on the path to achieve the efficiency targets that we had talked about in prior years driven by growth and digital productivity gains and really enabled by our tech transformation the pandemic has really impacted the timing of when we get there particularly on revenue growth now we feel good about our current revenue trajectory and were still on the same efficiency journey but how the pandemic and the recession will play out remains uncertain and how the growth opportunity unfolds and also the sort of the great credit paradox with the strength of credit also comes the high payment rates which certainly its a great thing for the overall financial performance of the company but its another thing that holds back the growth so were leaning in to really in the growth opportunities and were on the same kind of heading to the same destinations we talked about before but were not giving guidance about the timing jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well go next to bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research let me add my congratulations scott i wanted to ask about the buyback authorization is it reasonable to expect that youd seek to be as aggressive as possible in executing on it such that we could see you do the full amount by the end of assuming a favorable backdrop where the fed withdraws payout restrictions and then within that how are you guys thinking about the regulatory capital impact of the cecl phaseins for day and under the cares act richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 yeah thanks for the question bill look with respect to the share buyback program i think the most important thing i just want to underscore is that the billion that was authorized by the board really underscores our commitment to returning excess capital to the shareholders and i think that were certainly excited to start that journey as we think about capital deployment i think the hierarchy there is first capital to growth opportunities and then share buybacks and dividends to follow and i would just point out that in our past practice you can see that we manage share buybacks dynamically and we take into account market conditions relative value our holistic view on where we are in our capital position in the first quarter well be limited to million i mention that based on the fed rules after that the pacing of the share repurchase are really going to be guided by the factors i just talked about and by any regulatory guidelines that we might see ill just say that we find our current valuation compelling and with over billion of excess capital were really looking forward to getting started on the program jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well go next to john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much guys for taking my questions rich you embarked on your digital banking transformation several years ago and at that point in time it seemed the intent was to scale a traditional bank and using a digital platform where you could do a lot more for your customers in a really simplified fashion over digital channels but digital banking i think has changed with the development of companies like sofi and some of the fintech companies kind of getting into call it thinner banking offerings with still digital wallets nonetheless im wondering does that through the development of migration of digital banking overall does that affect how you see investments going forward to capital one richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp everything that we see john i think reinforces our conviction about the strategy that we have and the journey that were on and the destination were so energetically pursuing so lets and first of all talk about the pandemic i dont think the pandemic changed much about the destination of banking but it changed the timing of that because it accelerated the digital journey and one thing thats been so striking about banking products and even banking products relative to credit card products is the stickiness and the inertia inherent in the customer relationships that have existed sometimes for many decades and so one of the challenges for any digital bank is how do you go after that inertia and create something compelling enough to cause people to switch and so its really nice being on in a sense the right side of history because we can see the direction things go what im struck by is the amount of acceleration that weve seen in these inevitable trends this year so thats a good thing for us and we want to capitalize on that now the other along the way not surprisingly weve seen the rise of some very intriguing banking fintechs and we watch with great interest their strategies in many cases they have very nice digital customer experiences in capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 some cases they have created strategies that the banking industry didnt come up with and we look with interest in that and in many ways root for their success because its all part of the same their success is a manifestation also of the accelerating change in customer behavior and the opportunity for digital banks so we have a lot of respect for some of the players were impressed by their innovation and were energized by their success and the success that were having and so as a result were leaning in continuing to lean in and leaning in a little harder on our own banking strategy john hecht q analyst jefferies llc appreciate the context thank you very much jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc rich in terms of the fintech discussion i was wondering if you could comment on buy now pay later did that impact your business from a lending competition perspective or syndicated risk standpoint and is it material enough for us to keep an eye on from a risk perspective richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so buy now pay later is a really interesting marketplace its kind of ironic because the original buy now pay later product was the credit card and so its interesting to be a very established credit card player and feel a little bit like the old guard as were watching these innovations on buy now pay later and i have a lot of respect for and im impressed by some of the things the success of the pointofsale lending products and pointofsale lending has of course existed since really the beginning of lending itself i think whats striking here is the way that it exists of course in the ecommerce space the way its got shelf space right there at the checkout page some of the elegance of the digital technology and interestingly right now financially how this marketplace works because the striking thing to me is that right now merchants are actually paying the bill as opposed to consumers and that tends to create a healthy marketplace it tends to create better selection dynamics then very often you see in some of these shortterm lending products they tend to have very high effective aprs and things that can sometimes lead to adverse selection so i think to me the thing that im most interested in watching from sort of the structure of that marketplace is what happens to the in a sense the merchant discount with respect to those products as the competition from lenders heats up in that space so thats something that well have to watch so i think theres a lot for capital one to learn in this marketplace and were watching it closely and we really with interest look to see how this opportunity evolves donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 thank you operator well take our next jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you sir our next question is from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys and scott congratulations rich maybe just to dig in a little bit further on the efficiency i understand that you dont want to put a timeframe on it however if we look at the performance this year were in the range still about basis points from the target that you had laid out so could you maybe just talk about the path to getting there from a financial perspective is it all about the return of card loan growth and the revenue growth that comes with it or is there more from the digital transformation on the cost side and if cost is part of it can you maybe just talk about what some of those drivers are and what the timing is in terms of us getting there thank you richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so ryan if the efficiency our journey and the success we had over a number of years really till the pandemic sort of set things back a bit was driven to kind of mathematically of course by the two factors sustained revenue growth and the efficiencies that were coming particularly from transforming to a more digital operating model and i think the same things that drove our efficiency ratio down over the years are going to be the same drivers going forward at the time that we gave the guidance on there were a lot of things coming together that not only on the efficiency side things like getting out of data centers things like the stepup that in the walmart revenuesharing relationship but very much we were looking at accelerating growth opportunities in our businesses particularly our consumer businesses so the pandemic set that back and so i would still say the biggest driver of the efficiency gains that we will continue to work toward will be on the revenue side because we still continue to invest in the digital opportunities that are in fact enabling the revenue growth and one thing that weve talked about is that were now finished with our eighth year of our tech transformation and in many ways this will be a lifelong transformation that we this has been a starting at the bottom of the tech stack journey and over time weve been working our way up the tech stack and the more we get up the tech stack the more the opportunities are things that well actually the world can see things that customers can experience and things that can more directly enable growth and thats why i mentioned on my comments about marketing is that some of the marketing opportunities we see are in fact specifically enabled by our tech transformation so therefore while tech continues to create efficiency opportunities it is also the basis for a number of our growth opportunities and we really want to take advantage of those were leaning in and of course it takes investment to do that so thats why i think revenue growth is i would expect it to still be the bigger driver of our efficiency capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 journey on a net basis than on the cost side but really the key is having a revenue growth that exceeds the growth in expenses of course jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator take our next question from moshe orenbuch please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks so rich in the past youve always youve had a tendency to see the loan growth kind of lag the marketing spend and account growth based upon credit lines and youve talked about the need to kind of incubate those accounts and increase their credit lines over time to get that balance and revenue growth can you talk a little bit about where you sit in that now given the unusual nature kind of where we are in the economic cycle richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp right well thank you moshe with our strategy of relatively lower lines weve often talked about how in many ways the primary credit risk and the primary growth comes really on the line increase side more so than just the originations themselves and so what we have often done in times of stress or when theres extra caution and you will remember moshe in the probably months prior to this downturn maybe two years we were also talking cautiously about lines because we said we are so long in the tooth on this economy and so that has been our strategy for managing risk is to try to hold the lines down where we can continue to lean into the origination side of the business and then open up the lines as we see more of the sun coming out and more opportunities one customer at a time so where we stand on that weve been particularly tight on the lines during this downturn but i think that as we watch the pandemic play out i think that we see opportunities one customer at a time but collectively pulling up on this we do see important opportunities for increasing those lines and as we do that that can put some momentum around the loan growth in a way that you dont just get from originations which were also leaning into moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and maybe as a followup when i would get the question in the past about what could cause rewards rates to kind of moderate or come down i had said an economic downturn and obviously weve got some form of an economic downturn and if anything its gone the other way any thoughts about kind of intensity of the rewards competition and how to think about that into the next year or two richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes its a really interesting question moshe whether a downturn causes reward rates to go down or up so the case for down in other words for the competition to get less intense about that is that people are pulling back theyre spending less and theyre more concerned about riding through the downturn than they are about trying to grow quite a bit capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 heres the flip side to that argument and the thing that i think is dominating in that particular tug of war and that is that what is most striking about the pullback probably true in any downturn but especially in this one is how much pullback there has been in spending and what a pullback there has been in spending by heavy spenders and i think thats not just a point about heavy spenders its partly what heavy spenders spend their money on which is travel and entertainment on a disproportional basis relative to others and those are the sectors that have been absolutely ph wackier so its generally the case that the heavy spenders from a credit point of view everything that we have seen would be consistent that they perform well in a downturn they just get more conservative in their spending travel opportunities and things like that dont necessarily look so enticing and certainly the case in this downturn and so i think what happens is a response from players to lean into increasing inducements to generate the volumes that people want to get we have seen significant increases in upfront bonuses weve seen increases in reward levels and i think thats probably a natural thing for us to expect in this particular environment even though paradoxically its associated with so much pullback jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening can you hear me okay richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks my question is just on how to think about the reserve levels and the reserve release from here i know the questions asked a little bit but the reason im raising it is i think you said that your reserve today is based on an unemployment rate of at i know theres a lot more inputs than just that but that at yearend is similar to last quarters yet at the same time i know rich you mentioned that every quarter that goes by with good credit is like a reduction of peak if not a pushout so how should i triangulate that should we be anticipating really more aggressive reserve releases as the quarters come through that are not so bad or is there something else going on in the reserving analysis that we should be thinking about richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy why dont i take that one so look i think that the as i mentioned a couple of times i think the biggest consideration in our reserve right now is just the uncertainty and trying to make sure that were capturing capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 all of the scenarios in thinking about that and that is resulting in us having a really high level of qualitative reserves on top of our modeled risk and so even in the current quarter where youre right our fourth quarter estimate of unemployment at around is consistent with where we were last quarter during the full year were expecting lower levels of unemployment than what we had forecasted or used in our allowance a quarter ago and so that coupled with we saw the passage of stimulus were both factors that drove the release this quarter but we still have even with the positive trends we put on even more qualitative factors because its just really hard to forecast where this thing is going to go and how it may play out and in the allowance we continue to expect that we will see the very low levels of credit come up and meet the high levels of unemployment that we see today and i really do believe that we will over time see that play out exactly how that relationship is going to normalize and if it doesnt normalize then were going to have allowance releases and theyre going to come in over time but until we start to see kind of more evidence that that relationship is going to stay kind of at the levels where it is i would expect that were going to continue to reserve against a variety of downside scenarios jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take the final question from bob napoli please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good evening and congratulations scott look forward to hearing where youre heading richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks bob robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc rich a question just on the tech investments and the i dont know if you can quantify at all for us maybe for scott the amount that youre spending on technology versus several years ago the growth in those investments and then maybe more importantly what do you feel differentiates you the most from other banks or fintechs with the changes the upgrades in the technology and whats on the roadmap for further upgrades richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay bob we dont break out our tech investments but capital one i think relative to banks our size invest quite a bit more in technology than my sense is of what other banks our size invest in by the way our primary competitive set is the big national banks and they have gigantic tech budgets so we dont we certainly know also what were up against but let me just talk about again so philosophically what weve done look i think when most banks or i think companies in general when theyre looking everybody knows theyve got to invest more in technology and capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 even as recently as this quarter so many companies said theyre increasing their technology spend and i almost cant imagine companies not feeling the need to do that as they face an accelerating digital revolution the thing thats very common that companies do is they make their biggest investments at the top of the tech stack meaning the things that are closest to the consumer investing in apps investing in experiences for customers or associates or things that can more directly and immediately manifest in improvements and its a very natural thing to do capital one has taken the unlikely journey a little bit the road less traveled by to have our investment primarily at the bottom of the tech stack so were talking down at core systems and data and addressing vendor products and their role in this thing bringing lots of things inhouse bringing a lot of engineering inhouse and its been a journey that and you know this bob and other investors on this call know that they would often say i know youre investing a lot youre talking about it but i cant see it because the problem is if you were to improve one system in the core systems it doesnt really manifest itself in something that the outside world can see and this is really the essence of the challenge that we and our investors who have patiently owned our stock of this journey that were going through what we so deeply believed at the outset of this journey and absolutely believe now that in order to compete with the tech companies in order to be a modern company and be able to go where banking is going to go is one really needs a modern tech stack and thats a hard thing for a startup bank to build its a really hard thing for a legacy company to build now i think it was a little easier for capital one only that we were in a sense an original fintech three decades ago and so maybe dont have as much legacy as a lot of companies do but its still been a very significant journey but i think when you say how do we compare ourselves with other companies i think other companies have i think theres a lot of good things other companies that go and they are doing they have really nice apps for their customers and everything else but i think more and more capital one is built like a tech company and like some of the leading tech companies that are changing the world and i think it was a little bit of a shock to some folks when one day we said by the way were getting entirely out of data centers and into the cloud and thats the kind of thing that could only come as a product of many years of this and its not an accident that almost no big enterprise legacy companies have in fact made that journey now where does but what it puts us in a position to do is to drive for opportunities and act more and more like a tech company and be able to be more dynamic faster to the markets offer better products a better customer experience and that gives us the opportunity to transform how we work really how a bank works on the inside from risk management fraud credit compliance operational execution it enables us to build our national bank and lean into that it enables us to win some partnerships that in headtohead competition i feel that we won by virtue of some of the tech capabilities we had it enables us to achieve better economics and not so much in saving on well partly tech on tech costs like massive vendor costs that we can save but at the same time were investing a lot in tech so that the big netnet savings is not so much the tech costs as it is the opportunity to reduce analog costs over time so thats kind of a long answer to your question but when we look out and said over time were going to want to do that or were going to do this thing over there or were going to do that thing over there in each case we saw a shared path of investment and transformation that we would need to do and were well down that path we are not done in many ways its a lifelong journey but i think our opportunities are increasing as we get farther down this path capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 robert napoli q analyst william
