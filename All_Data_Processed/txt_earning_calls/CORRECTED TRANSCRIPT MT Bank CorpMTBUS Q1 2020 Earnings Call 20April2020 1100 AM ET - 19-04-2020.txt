darren j king chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thank you don and good morning everyone before we start id like to take a moment to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts put forth by mts employees in response to the covid19 pandemic that over the past few weeks has impacted virtually every aspect of our economy id like to share a story about our branches when i first heard from washington dc but when ive since heard multiple times from across our footprint in mid to latemarch all of our relationship bankers began reaching out to customers to ensure they had appropriate access to their money with a particular focus on customers who infrequently use mobile and web banking at the end of one such conversation our banker asked the customer if there was anything else we could do to help her the customer said i need food my husband passed away i lost my job and i have no food im hungry ph natalie quickly brought this to the attention of her branch manager who in turn shared the story with the rest of the team and they decided to do something about it after closing the branch for the day the team went shopping and on their way home delivered a significant supply of groceries to help our customer through her difficult time having previously managed the branch network i can assure you this procedure is not covered in the branch operations manual next id like to share some metrics that we believe highlight how mt is operating in the current environment while practicing safe social distancing helping customers and enabling commerce as of last friday of our mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 fullservice domestic branches are open and operating with a few restrictions drivethrough windows and atms are

deferrals fee waivers and low interest rate loan products our mortgage servicing group has worked to help customers seeking payment relief for loans we own or for those we service for others so far weve provided assistance to over customers whose loan balances total some billion just under of those balances are serviced for others in total weve assisted an approximately of the mortgage loans we service similarly for customers with other consumer loans auto and recreation finance credit cards and home equity loans weve provided nearly customers with some form of payment relief these customers hold balances of over million and represent just under of our consumer loan portfolio mt has been helping small business customers to access the governments paycheck protection program or ppp this program offers loans backed by the small business administration intended to sustain monthly business expenses such as paychecks for employees who would otherwise be laid off rent and utilities in total mt associates helped a total of clients get approved for ppp loans totaling more than billion over mt bankers worked around the clock to make that possible for our customers those companies collectively employ more than workers and if additional funding is made available we have a backlog of additional clients we are ready to help get approved for other business customers large and small and who entered the pandemic in good standing we are offering shortterm payment deferrals or other modifications to their existing credit agreements to help them manage shortterm cash flow challenges so far weve provided modifications to nearly businesses with an aggregate principal balance of billion and last week we began receiving funds from the treasury department for deposit of covid19 stimulus payments into our customers accounts we know therell be more to do in the coming weeks and our team stands ready to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities next lets look at the financial results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the first quarter of compared with in the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the yearago quarter on a gaap basis mts first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur mts net operating income for the first quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million this compares with million in the linked quarter and million in last years first quarter diluted net operating mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2019s fourth quarter and in the first quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity recall that both gaap and net operating earnings for the first quarter of were impacted by a noteworthy item included in that quarters results was in addition to our legal reserves of million relating to a subsidiarys role as a trustee for customers employee stock ownership plans this amounted to million aftertax effect or per diluted common share turning to the balance sheet and the income statement taxable equivalent net interest income was million in the first quarter of down by million from the linked quarter this comes as the result of a lower level of average interestearning assets combined with a nearly stable net interest margin margin for the past quarter was up basis point from in the linked quarter as we indicated on our january conference call a more favorable mix of earning assets including a lower absolute level of average funds on deposit with the fed combined with a higher proportion of loans provided a benefit to the margin of an estimated basis points further declines in interest rates caused about basis points of pressure to the margin a relatively modest decrease helped by an basis point decline in the cost of interestbearing deposits as a result of higher forecasted prepayments accelerated premium amortization on residential mortgage loans acquired in the hudson city acquisition and on mortgagebacked securities accounted for another basis points of pressure several other factors combined to contribute to a net basis point margin reduction those factors include the lesser day count in the quarter compared with the prior quarter and nonaccrual loan interest which includes the change in the recognition of interest income on acquired loans as a result of our adoption of cecl average interestearning assets declined by just over reflecting a decline in deposits with the fed and a decline in investment securities partially offsetting those declines was a increase in average loans outstanding compared with the previous quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans increased including growth in dealer floor plan loans commercial real estate loans also grew by compared to the fourth quarter residential real estate loans which include mortgage loans acquired in the hudson city transaction continued to pay down consistent with our expectations the portfolio declined by more than or approximately million consumer loans were up nearly activity was consistent with recent quarters where growth in indirect auto and recreational finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans on an endofperiod basis commercial and industrial loans increased by billion or more than we estimate that draws on previously undrawn contractually committed lines accounted for nearly billion of that increase as the covid19 crisis led many customers to access funding sooner rather than later to manage their own liquidity mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman islands office and cds over declined less than or nearly million compared to the prior quarter there were multiple factors that drove the change lower average mortgage escrow deposits a decline from seasonally high commercial deposits in the fourth quarter and time deposit maturities those factors were partially offset by draws on credit lines being immediately deposited back into customers operating accounts lower levels of offbalance sheet sweep activity by customers as lower rates have made sweeps less attractive and a moderate flight to quality as customers view funds on deposit at mt as safer than other alternatives on an endofperiod basis core deposits were up reflecting new inflows of mortgage escrow deposits as well as the redeposit of line draws lower levels of offbalance sheet sweeps and the flight to quality issues i just mentioned foreign office deposits decreased on an average basis and nearly on an endofperiod basis with sweep rates nearing historic lows we expect to see less onbalance sheet sweep activity by commercial customers consistent with our experience during the zero rate environment over the first half of the prior decade instead funds would likely remain in their operating accounts either dda or interest checking turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the first quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the recent quarter included million of valuation losses on equity securities largely on our remaining holdings of gse preferred stock while 2019s final quarter included million of similar losses mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were million in the quarter up more than from million in the fourth quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were million in the first quarter improved from million in the prior quarter the increase reflects the higher volume of loans originated for sale combined with a stronger gainonsale margin commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the first quarter compared with million in the linked quarter and the comparable figure in the first quarter of was million trust income was million in the recent quarter down slightly from million in the previous quarter results for the first quarter were solid through the first two months but were then dampened by the march collapse in equity markets service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the fourth quarter the decline from the linked quarter reflected some normal seasonally lower levels of customer activity in addition to the covid19driven slowdown in payments activity during the first quarter of mt received a cash distribution of million from bayview lending group mts results in the first quarter of included a similar distribution amounting to million turning to expenses operating expenses for the first quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were million as noted million of operating expenses in the first quarter of included the million addition to the litigation reserve mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 operating expenses for the recent quarter included approximately million of seasonally higher compensation costs related to the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirementeligible employees the hsa contribution the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401k match and fica payments as well as the annual reset in fica payments and unemployment insurance those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately million in last years first quarter as usual we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter excluding those seasonal factors salaries and benefits were a little change from the prior quarter the yearoveryear increase reflects the higher head count as weve been deepening our bench of talent which as weve previously noted has allowed us to reduce our reliance on outside contractors and bring new products and services to our customers more quickly other cost of operations for the past quarter included a million addition to the valuation allowance on our capitalized mortgage servicing rights recall that there was a million reduction in the allowance in 2019s fourth quarter the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2019s fourth quarter and in the first quarter of those ratios in the first quarters of and each reflect the seasonally elevated compensation expenses next lets turn to credit what had been a relatively healthy economy at the end of and early this year has deteriorated faster than most of us would have expected while the first quarter changes in nonaccrual loans and net chargeoffs were still fairly benign we are preparing for the likelihood of increased credit costs as the economic impact of the pandemic and the unprecedented stimulus programs unfold at the end of in accordance with the then prevailing incurred loss accounting standard mts allowance for credit losses amounted to billion or of loans in connection with the adoption of the current expected credit loss standard mt added million to the allowance reflecting higher lifetime loss expectations under cecl those expectations included certain assumptions such as economic growth unemployment and other factors the provision for loan losses in the first quarter amounted to million exceeding net chargeoffs by million and increasing the allowance for credit losses to billion or of loans the allowance currently reflects an updated series of assumptions reflecting a more adverse economic scenario those assumptions include a significant deterioration of future macroeconomic indicators used in our reasonable and supportable forecasts including an unemployment rate approaching double digits and a significant contraction of the gdp in the second quarter the assumptions reflect a moderate recovery in the second half of nonaccrual loans amounted to million or of loans at the end of in connection with our adoption of the cecl accounting standard on january mt reclassified million of loans that were previously acquired at a discount as nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans as of march amounted to billion an increase of million from december thus except for the accounting reclassification nonaccrual loans declined during the past quarter at the end of the quarter nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans was net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the first quarter compared with basis points in the fourth quarter loans mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter of those loans million or were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the fourth quarter and which reflects the net impact of higher loans and earnings net of dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter mt repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million now turning to the outlook to start it goes without saying but ill say it anyway that the outlook and any forward looking statements we made on the january earnings conference call are no longer applicable as far as the balance sheet goes our liquidity assets shortterm investments and the deposits with the fed will be somewhat fluid as shorter term deposits particularly from the servicing operation expand or contract with refinancing activity we wouldnt expect to make any significant purchase of investment securities in this environment future balance movement will be impacted by the pace and breadth of the economic restart once the pandemic is believed to be under control holding government programs aside for a moment average loans for the year will expand somewhat faster than previously expected as the line draws at the end of the first quarter roll into the average as well as the impact of any principal deferrals as showrooms are mostly closed around the country automobile sales and inventory are stalled as are those of recreational vehicles although to a somewhat lesser extent focusing on government programs and their impact on the balance sheet the most certain is the ppp program while the balances that will be added to our balance sheet are known as is the yield there is a great degree of uncertainty as to the duration of these loans these are extensively twoyear loans but payments and forgiveness will result in many loans being on the balance sheets for less than that time introducing uncertainty into the size of the loan portfolio and the net interest margin in the coming months the details of the main street lending program are still being finalized and as such our level of participation in the program if any remains unclear fees held up well in the first quarter however we are closely monitoring trends in interest rates equity markets and pandemic responses to assess their impact on our businesses residential mortgage applications continue to be very strong with rates as low as they are trust income will be impacted by the state of the equity markets by a likely resumption of waivers of money market mutual fund management fees although zero rate environment persists and the potential for an extended slowdown in debt capital markets activity payment volumes in aggregate are down slightly and were offering fee waivers to our consumer customers certain industries such as restaurants travel and other leisure activities are being more heavily impacted by locallymandated social distancing lockdowns lower payments activity will likely persist while those restrictions remain in effect we expect the seasonal salaries and benefits surge we had in the first quarter to normalize as it does every year we have significantly curtailed hiring in this environment and have been actively redeploying team members around the bank to address shifting business needs like other businesses around the country shelterinplace mandates will impact other aspects of our expense base such as the use of contractors and travel and entertainment expense mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 credit costs are difficult to predict but as mentioned earlier we are preparing for a challenging environment while our consumer customers navigate through the forbearance period and our larger commercial customers work through a period of temporary debt restructuring the ultimate impact of recent events on credit will not likely be clear for several months turning to capital the current environment has not caused us to reconsider our longstanding capital allocation philosophy our primary use of capital is to support the economic activity of our customers while serving as a source of strength in the communities we serve we will maintain prudent levels of capital to support that objective of course as you are aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future as weve just learned now lets open up the call to questions before which brandi will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from ken zerbe of morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning guys darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc just in terms of your cecl assumptions it almost sounds like youre using the moodys baseline from the end of march which i guess has gotten materially worse since the end of march could you just talk about what you might expect for provision or how youre thinking about that as we go into second quarter darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure if you look at the moodys which we do look at their various scenarios we consider a range of their scenarios the baseline is primary but if you look at this quarter i think its their the s3 scenario was also considered in our thought process when we were thinking through the assumptions in the cecl and i guess id just remind you that the economy and the expectations for the future are certainly in flux and we looked at those and considered those when we were going through our work at the end of the quarter at that point we were probably expecting a sharp turn down and maybe a sharper recovery than what would appear to be the case today but as we go through the next days well know more and well see how things unfold how mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 quickly a restart happens or doesnt and how those affect the future projections both from what were seeing and what moodys is seeing as we go through the quarter and as we think about things at the end of this quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay no i understood that does help i guess maybe an easy question just given whats happened to the rates i know you talked a little bit about the margin and the factors that affected it this quarter but how are you guys thinking about margin going into darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well its our expectation that the margins probably moving down in the quarter when you look at the while libor has held up well it did move down at the end of well as we went through the quarter and its important to keep in mind when pricing changes happen in the loan portfolio and technical difficulty the benchmark rate or the reference rate gets updated usually in the first few days of the month and so any changes in that later in the month dont get reflected until the following and so as you look at what happened this quarter with the drop of basis points coming after the first week in march most of that will start to get reflected in april and through the second quarter the only other thing that id just remind folks as we think about margin in the second quarter is the ppp loans are going to have an impact on the margin at those are lowyielding loans although they carry a zero risk weighting thats a substantial portfolio that will come on stream in the next several days and will have a material impact on the margins so i try to think about it a little bit both in terms of the margin but also in focus on net interest income and the dollars of net interest income and how those are likely to unfold over the course of the next three six and nine months ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect and if i can just fit operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester of compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey back in march you guys gave some disclosure on some of the loan buckets youre watching a little more carefully can you just give an update on the reserving youve done in those buckets and maybe some of the credit metrics around those i know you mentioned ltvs in your hotel book of about but if you could just mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 talk about the billion or so you have in senior housing or assisted living centers and maybe the billion in retail just trends youre seeing there how youre thinking about reserving that would be great darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess if you look at the various portfolios the ones that were paying a lot of attention to hotel retail restaurants leisure and to some extent the healthcare facilities what were seeing so far is still early in terms of their economic performance and when you look at we dont have first quarter financials yet when you looked at where things were at the end of last year they were still pretty strong and so to see a change in the portfolio this early doesnt really happen but as we look at the at forbearance and payment relief a lot of those industries are places where theyre getting some help and when we look at some of the underlying trends in terms of loan to values theyre still solid i think it will take a while for loan to values to adjust as well because a lot of times the value is a function of the cash flows and it remains to be seen what the ultimate longterm set of cash flows are with many of those industries hotels being an obvious one and so its still little early to say that were seeing severe challenges in those industries per se but as we talked about when you look at the reserving weve increased the reserve pretty substantially since the end of the year and thats the whole idea of cecl is to start to account for the impact of changing economy on various industries the other thing to keep in mind which is still hard to really assess is how the stimulus package which is really unprecedented might impact any of these portfolios and in particular the ppp program as a result of that many of the industries that we are concerned about have accessed the ppp program and for our customers they should be receiving the funds started over the weekend and should happen through the end of the week and that should give them some liquidity to help get through the next twoandahalf months as the program was designed so no material regrading at this point as we just spend our time actually working with customers and calling them and making sure that we understand their situation and figure out ways to help keep them operating david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc perfect appreciate that detail do you happen to have the size of the restaurant book in the leisure segment you mentioned or maybe just the overall portfolio of the segments you mentioned the hotel indiscernible everything combined just to get a sense of what that total is darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah when you look through the 10k tables and outline a lot of the stuff you look at hotels between permanent and construction its just about billion retail you mentioned was about billion that covers a broad range of industries i guess a couple of things to keep in mind in retail is when you look at ci retail a lot of that is multiunit retail and convenience stores associated with gas stations and so those have been essential and those have been open although im sure operating at lower volumes and much of the retail book is actually associated with multistorey buildings in manhattan and retail happens to be the first floor but the way it gets coded it gets coded as retail if you look at restaurant and leisure there are segments that arent individually big enough that we call them out separately in those tables together theyre about billion so i give you that theyre contained within the other and some of the other line items but collectively theyre relatively small in the grand scheme of things mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then maybe just one last one on the assisted living center piece or the senior living center darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc as you talk to those clients are they starting to see any customer attrition due to concerns around the virus at all or at least maybe reduced interest in new signups and then what general breakeven occupancy whats the general breakeven occupancy for those darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so its still early in the process and we havent heard any mass defections i think most of the time people have chosen to stay in place and try to isolate themselves within the facilities and many of the owner operators are taking measures to help care for the residents by separating them by floors based on whether theyre theyve tested positive or not but theres really no other place in many cases for these folks to go and so they stay where they are and so we havent really seen any material change in occupancy rates as of last week david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and then in terms of how full they need to be in order to maintain profitability any sense for what that breakeven is darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i think its hard to give an exact number because it varies by facility type and by geography the one thing i guess we do know is weve seen at an industry level some of the occupancy rates come down just as new builds came online but thats an industry where those rates move up and down and the operators are pretty savvy about being able to absorb capacity so we havent seen anything yet where there is an issue with the facilities ability to maintain occupancy rates above their breakeven david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great all right thanks guys appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hey john how are you john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right just regarding the reserve and the addition you made this quarter can you just give us a little bit of color on your throughcycle loss assumption that you baked in to come up with that addition to the reserve i know the fed has you at about billion or in the dfast your company run was about or about billion so how are you thinking about that whats a fair throughcycle loss number and did you run your analysis yet darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp we havent run the or updated it since the stress test and the ccar submission if you think about the cecl and how it works youve got a reasonable and supportable period right which is a couple of years and then after that you revert to the longterm average of the portfolio and so theres a little bit of a difference between cecl and its calculation of losses versus what the stress test might be in addition to the assumptions made in the stress test about well one how severe it is and how long it is but so far the assumptions in cecl would have been almost as severe although not quite but certainly not as long and so theres a change that may or may not happen depending on how the economy restarts i guess well see as we go but those would be the big factors that would be different between those two i guess the thing that we focus is much or more on what we know to be the quality of the portfolio and the quality of the credits that underlie it and when you look at the ccar results you look at our dfast which you mentioned we are lower than the fed under stress and our actual losses in the last crisis were lower than that and when we think about our reserving were obviously adjusting it and taking into account the latest information about whats going on in the economy but were also looking at the portfolio and whats happening in the portfolio and its so far very very early on to understand how the impact of the stimulus is going to work how quickly the restart is going to impact the portfolio but just looking at loss coverage over the average of the last five years the loss coverage in the allowance is about seven times what the chargeoffs have been and our peak losses as a percentage of loans in the last crisis was and so theres lots of different ways to kind of triangulate and figure out whether or not you feel reasonable with the reserve and based on the assumptions that we used we felt comfortable with the combination of those moodys scenarios that we talked about we looked at the quality of the portfolio and how its performing so far and the history and looked at the ratios along a number of those dimensions and based on where we sit right now we feel comfortable with it and if the outlook changes then well update that at the end of the next quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks darren and then my followup is just around on the capital side and more specifically if you could just talk about the sustainability of the dividend here how do you look at that do you think theres a potential likelihood of a cut or do you think its fair where it stands right now thanks mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure its interesting how our conversations about our dividend change through time it wasnt that long ago that payout ratio didnt seem like very large and we kept saying one day the world will change and it will be good to have a lower payout ratio so we start from a good spot in terms of the payout ratio when you look at the ppnr to assets the ratio of ppnr that we generate compared to the average is at the high end if not amongst the high end certainly amongst our peer group and we expect that to continue in the short term and our capital ratio is even at assuming we dont do any repurchases is only going to go up and we have basis points of distance between us and where we would believe we would be under the stress capital buffer framework and so for now we feel pretty good that were generating earnings and have the capital that we need to be able to support lending to creditworthy customers in our community and so for now we feel like its sustainable and ill remind you that we worked really hard to make sure it was sustainable through the last crisis as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of frank schiraldi of piper sandler frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hi frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just curious about the levels of darren if you could just talk a little bit more about the levels of deferment youre seeing specifically on the commercial side and if you think about some of those buckets of concern like restaurant just curious where restaurant and your hospitality portfolio is in terms of total deferments at this point darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah just going to get a little more detail on if i got it by industry now when i look at the work that weve done so far as you might expected the deferrals in the commercial book first they skew towards the small business customer just because of the numbers and when you look in there its disproportionately restaurants hotels and parts of the economy that are related to activity and people being out and about the other thing though thats important to keep in mind is when i also look through the distribution of industries that were accessing ppp and were funded through the ppp program it reflects a very similar distribution in terms mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 of the types of customers that are receiving funds under that program it would skew towards restaurants it would skew towards hospitality and hotels and the like as well as some of the construction thats been shut down and so when we look at the deferrals that have happened so far whats interesting at least to me is that there is lots of folks both in consumer and in commercial who have asked for deferrals but have not actually exercised it and so just to give you an example within the mortgage portfolio about athird actually made their april payments when we look at some parts of the real estate book in the multifamily space our customers are reporting that anywhere between and depending on the type of property of the rental payments were made by customers in april and many of those would have sought some kind of deferral and so a lot of these programs were implemented and mandated by various state authorities and people took advantage or at least took the time to call and say i want you to know that ive been impacted by covid so that if they choose to take advantage of the deferral or the payment relief that theyre okay doing it and there wont be any issues with credit reporting and the like but in the first month we were quite pleased and pleasantly surprised with the number of payments that were actually made frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and just as a followup on the ppp program just wondering how youre thinking about that from in terms of customers versus i mean i would imagine you guys have your hands full with prioritizing customers but if there is a second round would you open that up to noncustomers as well if you could just maybe talk about how youre thinking about that darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure were hopeful that there will be a second round because obviously it was in high demand by business customers around the country and a very helpful program we are in business to help all the customers in our communities whether theyre actual customers today or future ones i think one of the things that maybe is a little misunderstood around the industry with relation to whether you look at customers or noncustomers wasnt to say we prefer customers over non but more to be able to get the money in the hands of folks more quickly because of amlbsa and know your customer processes it was much easier to expedite your existing customers because those checks were already done and that youd already done those verifications and therefore you could process them more quickly and had a better chance of helping them get access to the ppp early on and if the amount gets increased or congress passes an additional amount of stimulus i suspect you will see that more noncustomers might look to access funds around the country but i think the sba and the fed did a good job setting up as many banks as possible to be able to provide access for their customers frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and do you have any expectations just final question on on how much of the ppp would be will ultimately be forgiven in the over the next couple of months as opposed to remaining on the books for a longer period of time perhaps up to two years darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 frank thats the milliondollar question its i think i guess we were pleased that the way the program was set up provided an opportunity for there to be forgiveness and that it was designed in a way to keep as many businesses as possible open and running and with people employed and so i would expect that that as many companies as could demonstrate that they met the criteria for forgiveness that they would choose to try and improve that and take advantage of that how quickly theyre able to do it i cant handicap but it seems very unlikely to me that a significant percentage will last the full two years right and how many will prepay or seek forgiveness after three months six months nine months i think its really tough to handicap which is part of the reason why forecasting balances going forward and forecasting the margin going forward is so difficult just because its really tough to figure out what might happen and again depending on where those customers were and which parts of the country and how quickly those parts of the country restart i think well have a big impact on what percentage of those customers seek and receive forgiveness and over what time period frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay all right thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey darren good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to ask you on the margin so just given the sharp move down in interest rates weve seen whats the new money yield today on loans and securities and loans will be exppp darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well so while the rates have come down what youve seen is spreads have widened and so when you think about the cost of funding for the banks while its down in absolute the spread that we have to pay is a little bit higher so when you think about yields youre probably seeing a little bit of an increase in the spread to the benchmark or the reference rate was probably in the low high as we entered the year youre probably seeing things in the range of basis points to basis points wider on new money coming in right now but obviously that varies a lot depending on the collateral and the loan to values and the industry but the absolute yield for the customers from their perspective even though the spreads might be a little bit wider is certainly coming down mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and what about securities darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well securities or whatever market is we dont anticipate adding a lot of securities in this environment just because of the impact that it can have on aoci as rates go up and when we look at the yield we get holding it in at the fed its not much different than what we can invest in and so just given the uncertainty of the cash flows and how long they might be around well tend to hold them more overnight while we wait for things to settle down steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my question darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache of nomura bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet hi good morning you guys disclosed that of your commercial loans and leases were secured at the end of last year can you discuss how youre thinking about the value of the underlying collateral today relative to history given the unique nature of the pandemic more specifically im curious whether you can frame how sensitive you think collateral values would be to either a more extended period of social distancing or just what that sensitivity is any color around that would be great darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure obviously the in many cases the value of the collateral is directly a function of the underlying business operations right so if you think about a hotel and the value of the property its as much a function of its ability to generate cash flow from occupancy and so the value of that collateral in the shortterm drops but its ultimate longterm value will be a function of how that particular geography rebounds from the pandemic and how quickly the occupancy rates come up and the other thing that youll find is and we found in the last crisis is when these values start to drop and people are stressed new money comes into the system and buys up those properties many of our customers are sitting on cash and hoping that some of these properties values come down because theyll see it as an opportunity to get good quality assets at a low price and so there does tend to be a bit of a floor on many of these things particularly the real estate assets and so i guess the thing that is tricky is in the short term there could be an immediate reaction but in the short term people dont have cash flow problems it takes them a while to burn through their cash and then like we said they access these various programs to bridge them and get them through and then we see how quickly they mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 come up and what we need to do to keep them going and so when we stress the portfolio well stress ltvs and see what happens with their cash flow and the impact that has on ltvs and well stress their debt service coverage ratio and well look at how far their income has to fall or rates have to go up or any of the above to look at their debt service coverage ratios and then when we we put those two together and historically when weve looked at the portfolios and we put those two things together we found that a very small percentage of our customers and outstanding dollars are really challenged and severely stressed when both of those things happen together and so weve got certain parts of the portfolio that are impacted more than others based on the pandemic and then within that there is different geographies that are impacted differently and then customerspecific situations that are impacted and so its always a work in progress to figure out what the loan to values might be at any given time the good news is that it takes a while for the losses and for these challenges to emerge and so whats interesting is the pace of information around society has gotten really fast but the pace of change in terms of how these things flow through the economy and impact businesses isnt quite as fast and so its going to take a while for this to work its way through the system and through the portfolios before you get into a situation where youre really relying on collateral values to try and bail you out but as youve heard from us before when we look at many of our statistics about loan to values in our commercial portfolios theyre very low when we look at loan value to loan they get even lower and so from where we sit today we feel like weve got a lot of room to be able to protect ourselves but really thats a last resort our first resort is to work with clients to keep them in business because thats the best outcome for everybody bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thats really helpful thanks so much for taking my question operator your next question comes from peter winter of wedbush securities peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you were talking about the margin you expect it to be down in the second quarter but strong loan growth as well so do you think net interest income would grow over first quarter levels darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp its the im hesitating peter not because im dodging the question but more its the impact of ppp and how that offsets the impact of the decreased margin against the loan growth right and so some of the loan growth mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 we saw at the end of the quarter was really nice well see how long those lines remain drawn but those will create some net interest income in the second quarter compared to the first maybe helps minimize some of the decrease and then the other question is those ppp loans adding billion of principal balance is helpful to net interest income i mean even though the yield is low there are some other fees associated with it and then we get to the question of how long they stay and then well have a full quarter impact of libor on the other side and its impact so absent ppp net interest income is probably moving down although not quite at the same rate as margin might be just because of the loan balance growth and then you add on the whatever your estimate is of ppp on top of that and how long those loans actually stay on the balance sheet operator your next question comes from the line of erika narajan sic erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good afternoon my questions have been asked and answered thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks darren just one on the fee side can you just talk about two things within that first of all how do you expect the residential mortgage business to act relative to the commercial business in terms of this new environment in terms of revenue generation and then secondly can you detail for us what fee waivers might look like in terms of the trust business and what magnitude that might have as an impact thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure i should have wrote this down remind me your first question again multiple speaker ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc residential versus commercial mortgage banking yeah darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 yeah so residential is going to see more activity i think the commercial business a lot of the way it works is the pipelines take a while to build and so the second quarter pipeline will be or fees will be a function of how the pipeline was before the economic activity slowed down in the stayathome orders or shelterinplace orders came into effect how quickly things start up how construction comes online how many people try to take advantage of rates will be a function of where they are in the back half of the year and so we would expect the commercial business from a mortgage perspective to be a little tougher probably wont be near what it was last year which the third quarter last year was a record quarter for us on the consumer side i think the refinancing activity continues especially with rates where they are you havent seen the rates come down for customers as much as they have in the market just because many of the servicers struggle with adjusting the underwriting and staffing to meet demand and so a lot of times what happens is the price gets impacted to manage demand and so youll see a little bit of benefit in gain on sale there the other thing thats a little bit of a question is how many people are in some kind of payment deferral or payment relief because it would be tougher for them to qualify for a refinance when theyre under that situation and so that will take some people off the table right away but it will keep the mortgage servicing business a little bit longer and so i would think that overall the cash flows there would be more secure and potentially have some more upside as people look to refi and you get the gain on sale component of that and i would expect that the the gain on sale margins will stay elevated for at least a little while longer just because of the ability to get folks on the phones and able to handle the volume thats coming in when you get to the trust lines or some of the other fees when you look at some of the other fees and kind of the service charge category youll see the impact of interchange and slower economic activity there as people are out doing less things and drawing on their account less often youll see the instance of nsf come down that tends to be an activitydriven fee and so you see a decrease there and then youve got the impact of the equity markets on assets under management and those fees and then depending on how long rates stay low youve got the impact on the money market mutual fund fees and not charging there and subsidizing that so on the funds maybe its million a quarter kind of impact if you look at the equity markets maybe the same kind of thing and then when you think about the other fees youre probably in the 15millionish a quarter million a quarter something like that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks a lot darren operator your next question comes from brian foran of autonomous brian foran q analyst autonomous research hi i know you said it was early on credit so i want to recognize that but i wonder if you could just speak to geography unfortunately new york city and westchester are kind of ground zero for the virus and theyre big markets for you as you look out over the next year and again recognizing the uncertainty but do you expect a materially different credit performance here in new york versus the rest of your footprint mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so i guess if you look at new york city we got to break down the different components of what sits in new york city and what percentage of the portfolio it is if you look in the hotel space its about of the portfolio and obviously its completely shut down and then theres not a lot of tourism happening there right now but if you look at those properties and the value of those properties we would expect those to hold up pretty well through time they might drop but the likelihood that they drop below our loantovalue for any extended period of time we dont see as a high probability right now when you think about the multifamily portfolio ill go back to where we talked about payments that were made by renters in april and that the rates of people paying their rent were quite high from kind of of the payments coming in and maybe our average building in terms of quality if you were to pitch it that way the higher end buildings were seeing payment rates of more in the range and so we would expect those folks to stay in good position weve mentioned a number of times just about the relationships we have in new york and how long they are and how liquid those customers tend to be that those are the ones that oftentimes in these environments would see opportunity as much as they see risk and would look to be buyers as opposed to sellers and then when i mentioned some of the retail in new york city youll see in retail probably be the hardest hit there and that the rental rates for high street properties on madison avenue and fifth ave theyve been under pressure for a while and so this probably resets those rates lower but in many cases when we look at our properties in manhattan where it might get classified as retail because of what those rates had been many of those if not all of those properties have multiple floors above the first floor retail space and they would have office or some residential or mixed use and the cash flow that comes from the upper floors is enough to sustain the property if retail is vacant or is challenged and so we feel pretty good that weve got the cash flow covered at least in the short term and totally understandable why new york city is a question obviously given our position there we pay a lot of attention to it and are in constant contact with the customer base and its because of that that i was able to quote some of those numbers about the rent payments that were seeing and so were on top of it and based on what we can see right now are confident that the portfolio will be solid like we saw in the last crisis operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren how are you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp doing well and how are you gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 good thank you obviously many of us have been around for a while covering this industry and we recall back in the sl crisis that the government got involved and trying to facilitate ph in solving first being required by healthy savings banks which ended up turning into a disaster for those savings banks weve then of course a tarp in where the government changes the rules on paying back tarp having to raise capital how can you reassure us if you can that the governments not going to change the rules on all these lending programs next year sometime and actually work against the banks in some shape some form i know its nobodys planning on that but can you put in any safeguards to try to insulate yourself from something like that darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp boy gerard youre dark today you got to get out of the place gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc there you go darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp go take a walk or something i guess right now our first priority is trying to help customers and make sure that we use the programs as we believe they were intended to try and put the money in the hands of our customers to try and keep them open and running and to help keep employment as high as it can be or paychecks flowing and to help stimulate the economy to make the impact of this pandemic as low as possible for our customers and our employees and our communities if you look at the programs that are out there many of the programs are repeats from last time if you look at the indiscernible program or you look at the commercial paper program or you look at many of the other programs they are repeats and have a outcome thats known so far we havent heard anything about tarp or the likes of tarp and i think if you look at the outcome of the last crisis and you look at the stress test and you look at the capital levels in the industry and amongst us and the peers were all starting from a great place when you look at liquidity which banks are not that difficult you either fail or survive because of liquidity and capital and so capital is in a good place and liquidity so far is in a good place and when you think about the moves that everyone is making to preserve both liquidity and capital i think were starting from a good place and so the industrys need to rely on some of these programs like we had to in the last crisis or some of the other ones that you mentioned is a little bit less i think as an industry as these programs are being developed by congress and by the fed were being asked for input and were trying to help provide input to make sure that the programs are structured in a way that make them most beneficial to the customer and so that we can help facilitate them i think this ppp program other than some of the operational and procedural hiccups that happened is actually a really good program and in that it was thoughtful in that it was designed to be relatively low documentation but you have to show that you are covering operating expenses so it was designed to keep you in business with the sba guarantee behind it it should be helpful and then with the forgiveness for the outside world i guess probably the thing that if if youre going to be cynical and worried you would worry about the documentation mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 aspect of the ppp program and whether theres a change of heart and how thats looked at i think you could argue that some of the fha programs and documentation became a bit of a bugaboo for the industry last time around but i think thats also partly why you saw some banks us included not rush out when the program became final on thursday night that thursday but go out on monday so that we could take the time to make sure we had a very good process where we could put the documentation in place and one of the key components of that was bsaaml and so i think theres a lot that the industry has learned to try and protect ourselves from those types of things were in a better starting place and at this time this isnt a financial crisis this is driven by something else and so hopefully some of the relationship well call it between the banking system and washington isnt at a place that it was in some of those other circumstances where youd see a change of heart but i dont want to be overly pollyanna and say that a change in administration in november could change all that too so its something i think we all got to keep an eye on but i think were starting from a better place and are in a more thoughtful place than we would have been as an industry going into the last crisis operator and thank you that does reach our allotted time for qa i would now like to turn the floor back over to don for any closing or additional comments donald j macleod administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp real quickly i had one question emailed to me asking about the bifurcation of the allowance at march consumer versus commercial i believe that the number we disclosed that with the adoption of cecl was commercial consumer it would be a little couple maybe one or two points higher than that today but not materially different again thank you all for participating today and as always if you have clarification of any items on the call or the news release is necessary please reach out to our investor relations department at area code thank you and goodbye operator thank you that does
