year pretax preprovision income of over million was our best year yet eclipsing the record set just last year by million the pandemic drove our provision expense for credit losses to an alltime high yet fullyear net income and eps were still very strong at million and respectively during last quarters call we mentioned that our pipelines were rebuilding our bankers business development activities during the quarter exceeded expectations delivering a record million of loan origination with columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 deposit ph size to a new

covid on the call with me today are aaron deer our chief financial officer chris merrywell our chief operating officer and andy mcdonald our chief credit officer well be happy to answer your questions following our prepared remarks i need to remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release our website or our sec filings at this point ill turn the call over to aaron to review our financial performance aaron james deer executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you clint earnings of million and eps of were materially influenced by the economic impact of the pandemic on our net interest margin and credit loss provision the steep decline in interest rates at the end of the first quarter was offset by a higher volume of lower yielding earnings from ppp loans and investment securities both indiscernible during the year interest income was further supported by the interest rate collar implemented at the beginning of expenses were carefully managed to million which was the lowest level since the year of the pacific continental acquisition fourth quarter earnings of million and eps of were an increase of million and respectively on a linked quarter basis quarterly pretax preprovision earnings increased million to million with the rise driven mostly by a combination of accelerated loan fees from the payoff of ppp loans and a recapture of credit loss provisions but there were other favorable operating trends in the quarter that contributed to the upside and helped to offset continued pressure on core asset yields total deposits ended the quarter at billion up million from september and billion over the past year the quarterly increase was most of the interestbearing demand was spread throughout our footprint the annual increase was attributed to federal stimulus including ppp loans as well as reduced spending and higher savings by both retail and commercial clients our cost of deposits declined to basis point during the quarter to basis points which was down basis points from the fourth quarter of the increase in deposits created additional liquidity and we moved a significant amount of our excess cash into investment securities during the quarter but were being mindful of potential deposit outflows heading into as a result of these investments our securities portfolio increased million to billion despite this considerable growth the composition and duration of the portfolio did not change materially the investment securities yields climbed just basis point to where i should note the fourth quarter yield benefited from in the early repayments on two fannie mae cmbs funds without these onetime payments yield would have been the net interest margin improved basis points on a linked quarter basis to the increase stemmed from the acceleration of million of ppp loan fees due to paydowns or forgiveness by the sba this added basis points to the margin on a standalone basis the ppp portfolio yield was and benefited the margin by basis points in addition the bank had a million recovery of interest on a nonaccrual loan that paid off adding basis points as well as the two early payoffs of investment securities i just mentioned that contributed columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 million of interest income or basis points to the margin for the year the net interest margin decreased basis points through decreases in loan and investment yield of bps and bps respectively as well as greater liquidity on the balance sheet ppp loans only contributed basis points of the decline as accelerated fee recognition offset ph the low interest rate total loans ended the quarter at billion down million from september driven by million of payoffs in the ppp portfolio excluding ppp loans balances rose million to billion new loan production has brought on an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which compared to the overall portfolio excluding ppp loans of noninterest income increased million in a linked quarter basis to million due largely to higher mortgage banking revenues stemming from strong volumes improved sale execution and a onetime benefit of roughly million from a change in our sale methodology noninterest expense decreased to on a linked quarter basis to million largely due to a million recapture of provision for unfunded loan commitments our noninterest expense ratio declined to for the quarter and our operating efficiency ratio decreased points to we expect our quarterly noninterest expense run rate to be in the mid to upper in the provision for income taxes increased million on a linked quarter basis to million representing a effective rate which was elevated given the higher level of taxable income in the final quarter of the year and the trueup of our fullyear effective rate to we expect our tax rate to be in the range of to and with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone as clint noted fourth quarter loan production of million was a new quarterly record propelling fullyear production excluding ppp loans to billion total loans declined from billion to billion mostly due to the payoff of ppp loans line utilization remained stable during the quarter at when compared to the end of total loans increased by million primarily due to open ppp loans of million as of the end of during a year of unprecedented challenges our bankers focus on relationships with our clients resulted in loan levels consistent with those before the pandemic this is a win and credit goes to everyone throughout the company for pulling together to move our clients businesses forward in a time of significant need excluding the impact of the ppp portfolio loans grew by million during the quarter growth was centered in the ci and cre portfolios which increased million and million respectively during the quarter record production in both portfolios was offset by payoffs and continued low line utilization cre growth in warehouse and retail segments and ci growth in rental and leasing and public administration segments were offset by declines in agricultural loans mortgage loans increased by million mostly due to the purchase of a million portfolio at the end of the quarter residential mortgage activity continued at an accelerated pace during the fourth quarter driving noninterest ph loan revenue higher by million on a linked quarter basis the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio of mix now stands at ppp loans nonppp fixed rate loans floating rate and variable ppp loans were million at the end of the year with over million of payoffs and paydowns since the forgiveness portal opened in midaugust if that wasnt enough weve opened our new portal for round two of the program on january and once again experienced a large volume of applications our bankers and back office teams are actively working with our clients to ensure that loans are funded as quickly as possible and we are seeing great results columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 deposits grew by million during the quarter and billion during the year to end the year at billion as aaron mentioned the deposit mix shifted from business and consumer as of september back to our typical businessconsumer split at december the decline in business deposits was attributed to our normal seasonality from a product perspective deposits as of december were evenly split between noninterestbearing and interestbearing as part of our brand strategy we completed the consolidation of two branches during the quarter and we continue to evaluate our distribution system as we move forward and now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks chris this quarters acl totaled million reflecting a million from the third quarter comprised of net chargeoffs totaling million and a provision release of million the lower required allowance was the result of an improved economic outlook offset by management adjustments for covidrelated exposure in the commercial real estate segments of the portfolio specifically restaurants office retail and hotels consistent with my comments last quarter the momentum and path of the recovery will continue to be threatened by the coronavirus pandemic while downside risk has narrowed numerous risks still remain such as the fourfold increase in covid cases throughout q4 the slow rollout of the vaccine ph faster decline in gdp over november and december and continuing localized lockdowns in our footprint our model assumes annualized gross domestic product to decline in the first quarter of by before rebounding and ending with a fourth quarter increase of the unemployment rate is predicted to end at as a reminder we use ihs markit for our economic forecasts as i noted previously we continue to ph apply over latest quarter of what we consider highrisk commercial real estate and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a significant northwest employer these amounted to a combined million in q4 an increase from million in q3 much of this thought process is driven by the lockdowns which occurred during the fourth quarter in our footprint we ended the quarter with an allowance relative to periodend loans of adjusting for the ppp loans the allowance to periodend loans increases to npas for the quarter were relatively unchanged at basis points however as you know i like to adjust for ppp loans and i agree this provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward with this adjustment npas do not increase but decline by basis points so again relatively unchanged past due loans for the quarter were basis points compared to basis points last quarter and net chargeoffs were annualized at basis points for the quarter versus basis points last quarter our impaired capital ratio improved modestly from to thanks to a decline in substandard assets in summary while our credit metrics improved for the quarter i would still characterize them as stable on the riskrating front loans rated watch or worse declined million during the quarter we saw watch loans decline million going from million to million special mention loans declined million to million and substandard loans saw a decline of million at yearend we had approximately million in substandard loans these changes decreased our watch and belowrisk ratings from to of total loans again very stable metrics columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 okay deferrals at the close of the quarter we had million in active deferrals or roughly of our portfolio excluding ppp loans this is up modestly from million deferrals at the end of the third quarter i would note that about of these loans are criticized classified assets the deferral bucket is comprised of million in clients with first deferrals and million of clients with second deferrals approximately or million of the second deferrals are related to an oregon state deferral program unique to our footprint and others doing business in oregon theres a statute that allows borrowers with loans secured by real estate in oregon to obtain a deferral simply because they have real estate domiciled in oregon this statute expired december so these borrowers will begin making payments again this month unless the oregon legislature amends and extends the statute most of the deferrals continue to be in the hospitality portfolio which accounts for million of the active deferrals as mentioned before this is consistent with our strategy relative to the sector and does not cause us to be any more concerned than when we entered the pandemic the remaining balance of the deferrals are really spread out across a wide variety of businesses the foreclosed identified back in april of as being some of the first to be impacted by the pandemic which includes our dental retail hotel healthcare restaurants and aviation portfolios amounted to about billion as of december or roughly of our loan portfolio if we exclude the dental and healthcare portfolios this number drops to billion or of our portfolio as of december the largest portfolio we identified again was our dental portfolio as previously discussed throughout we believe the impact on this portfolio to be truly transitory when we look at the credit metrics for this portfolio that story varies out past loans represent of the portfolio special mention and substandard loans actually declined in the fourth quarter we have only one loan on deferral for past dues are only basis points and nonaccruals are basis points we will likely be removing the pandemicimpacted portfolio for our reporting the next largest segment we identified as having high risk relative to the economic disruption caused by covid is our retail portfolio we have approximately million in retailrelated exposure excluding ppp loans its comprised of commercial real estate and commercial business loans and represents about of our total loan portfolio the largest part of our retail exposure comprises commercial real estate loans which account for approximately million of the total or roughly again to give you an idea of the types of retail properties we finance the most common are small fourto fivebay strip centers located in suburban communities and standalone singletenant properties in addition the portfolio contains groceryanchored centers and mixeduse properties we are not in large downtown core metropolitan areas nor do we finance regional malls or big box retailers for the entire retail portfolio is ph taxrated of which is watch which we also categorize as a ph tax category it is a slight improvement over last quarter and continues a positive trend while this trend is encouraging we remain cautious given governmentmandated covid closures and government mandated deferrals okay deferrals in this segment are up slightly from the third quarter from to about with half on their first deferral and the other half on their second deferral however it is still a significant improvement from earlier in the year than deferrals accounted for of the portfolio using add origination values the average loantovalue for the portfolio is with of the portfolio having loantovalue less than we have stresstested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen during the great recession the average loan to value rises to with about of the properties having a loantovalue less than obviously we were pleased with columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 how this portfolio is performing but we remain cautious and our expectation is that we will see weakening in this portfolio throughout lets discuss hotels next we have million in hotel loans representing about of our loan portfolio again to give you an idea on the type of hotels we financed most have one of the following flags holiday inn best western choice marriott and wyndham in total flagged properties comprise percent of the portfolio the average loan size is million today we have million on deferral which is down from last quarter when approximately million was on deferral however million of the million is on its second deferral for us this is not surprising as we are executing on longerterm strategies we do expect deferrals will continue to decline in this category for the fourth quarter we actually saw some healing in this portfolio loans rated special mention and substandard declined from million to million as the leisure travel properties performed well in it appears that since folks do not go to hawaii puerto rico or europe they chose to go to the pacific coast national parks in idaho and oregon as well as other recreation areas indiscernible similar to the retail and commercial real estate portfolio we continue to do stress testing on this portfolio as well the average loan tovalue for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is with of the portfolio having a loanto value less than on a stress basis about of the portfolio has a loantovalue less than lets move on to the nondental healthcare portfolio which is about million in total excluding ppp loans similar to the dental portfolio we saw the impact of the pandemic here to be transitory problem loans have remained steady at around of the portfolio for the last three quarters and this is down from at year end past dues are consistent at basis points and payment deferrals have declined from million to which really only represents one client next up is restaurants and food services this of course is a portfolio that has been very impacted by government actions attempting to control the covid19 pandemic after having been forced to close in the spring of and then again in the late fall and early winter of we anticipate further weakening in this portfolio throughout we have approximately million in this portfolio booked in this portfolio excluding ppp loans with two thirds comprising commercial real estate loans today is watch or better down from at the end of the third quarter thus watch and worse loans increased million to million in absolute terms not big numbers but directionally it demonstrates the effects of governmental action we granted deferrals for about million in this portfolio today we have payment deferrals for about million last quarter this portfolio add million in deferrals similar to the hotel and retail segments we see this area taking some time to heal and we are not surprised by the negative migration certainly the current round of ppp funding will greatly benefit this segment we do stress testing again on this portion of the portfolio and on a prepandemic basis the average loantovalue is with having a loantovalue less than again on a prepandemic basis under our stress test scenario average loantovalue rises to with only having a loantovalue less than the last portfolio im going to discuss is our aviation portfolio now its comprised of both direct exposure to domestic airline carriers as well as entities that lease airplanes and engines to airline carriers in total the portfolio was about million with about million being direct exposure to us domestic airlines and the remaining million exposure to lessors columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 today most of the portfolio is rated watch which is consistent with last quarter given the longer duration for recovery in this segment risk ratings are highly dependent on borrowers liquidity and run rate or as we call it burn rate positions of the domestic airlines we have exposure to they have raised over billion in additional capital to assist them through this pandemic as such this additional capital combined with expense reduction efforts results on our borrowers having between to months of burn rate this is not including billion more that was recently announced in additional payroll support agreements with the us treasury department based on the current burn rate the airlines with the majority of our exposure have sufficient liquidity to get them into the fourth quarter of most of the domestic airline exposure is secured by aircraft with a free stress loantovalue of and a current loantovalue really closer to however on a stress test basis our loantovalue rises to as for the leasing portfolio which again is only million of the exposure is in asia in europe and in south america the rest is in north america and the middle east the majority of the portfolio consists of narrow body aircraft with an average age of years we view the younger more fuelefficient aircraft as the most in demand postpandemic based on origination values our average loantovalue for this portfolio is and are based on what we believe to be todays value probably closer to and on a stress basis it rises to similar to the domestic airlines many of the lessors have been able to access the bond market and securitize unencumbered assets to bolster their liquidity positions we estimate our lessors to have raised over billion in liquidity as now through the third quarter so while the climb back to profitability and more importantly positive cash flow for this industry will be protracted it continues to attract the necessary capital to bridge them to a return to profitability which we do not anticipate until at the earliest okay with that ill turn the call back to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you andy despite the challenges of we remained focused on supporting our communities throughout the year we extended our community impact by tailoring our efforts to meet the unique challenges of the year combining fundraising company contributions and important dividend generated nearly ph million in economic support across our footprint this is a testament to our employees dedication to the communities where they live and work im particularly proud of the theyve raised for walmarts winner drive during the holiday season nearly million have been raised to support more than shelters over the indiscernible sixyear history our teams also supported community through a pass it on program where we saved more than small businesses over to provide indiscernible for someone in the community who was impacted by covid19 or the economic downturn this is just a few examples of the ways our team expressed their dedication to our communities in im proud of their continued support and the commitment they demonstrated in the midst of a very challenging year lastly we announced our regular quarterly dividend of this morning this quarters dividend well be paying on february to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 this concludes our prepared comments and as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions now carmen we will open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jeff rulis with da davidson your question please jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thank you good morning wanted to clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co check back in on the just the expenses and i got aarons sort of guide of midupper run rate but just kind of thinking about the mix of that and catching up to where you sit on kind of investment versus management of expenses and just kind of the intricacies i know that its an ongoing investment but just trying to get to where anything new youre launching or what the spend youve had in years past just trying to catch up with that dynamic thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc that kind of touches several areas ill let aaron get into the detail of it and then as appropriate chris might jump in but just to start with one of the things and i think you caged your question in this fashion is that weve never stopped investing in our business and in the future of our franchise and that investment can be in from additional technology can be reopened in the quarter or our newest neighborhub in boise thats an investment at community also theres a fair amount of disruption that occurred across the across our threestate footprint and its with some of the large national banks that are consolidating operations amid covid and remote work has been a dynamic that has caused folks to maybe reconsider the companies that they work for and we continue to remain an employer of choice broadly across our markets and so weve had the opportunity to look at new teams so as those opportunities present themselves well continue to take a longterm view and make the investments that we think will drive additional returns down the road for our shareholders and so now ill step back and let aaron add his details aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 yeah jeff as you saw in the press release we did have the million recovery book provision from side commitments in the fourth quarter so thats obviously something to keep in mind when youre thinking about where the run rate guidance is for next year in addition theres always kind of normal yearend trueups a variety kind of ins and outs on that front one of the largest of those we had a reversal of a medical accrual in the fourth quarter so that obviously wont carry into the first and then as you know you always kind of have some higher approach generally in the comp side indiscernible cost those sorts of things headed into the new year indiscernible also just as a yearoveryear reference we called it in the early part of we recognized million in credit for fdic assessments those benefits have obviously gone away and then as the year goes on were hoping that indiscernible our bankers are excited to get back out in front of clients and off of zoom calls and so we could see some increase in travel indiscernible costs and that sort of thing as clint said always investing in new personnel and new technology is just kind of an ongoing part of our business and i dont know if chris has anything to add in terms of kind of special items on that front christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc no probably just more jeff youve followed us for a long time and know that we have a pretty consistent methodical process around our branch system and other parts of the network and weve been knocking down square footage for years for decades and well continue to look at that well continue to do it theres a piece now thats been brought into play with all of the consolidations in the industry or the closures were looking at that from an opportunistic standpoint and what does that mean were seeing business that were able to pick up so theres a revenue play on the side too from these branch consolidations especially on more of the world communities and things of that nature so again well look at that well look for opportunities but i wouldnt see us changing from our current direction of consistency if you will on that as far as people theres certainly disruption in the industry when mass consolidations are announced and things like that it creates anxious employees and were an employer of choice as clint mentioned and so well continue to look at the where those folks come available and if the investment makes sense and the opportunity is there well certainly continue down that path but its been a very disciplined approach over the history of the bank and i dont see that changing jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co appreciate it thats good coverage one last one just maybe for clint its been a while on the acquisition front and some of that certainly by design but also perhaps by the market any update on your appetite within that and my guess is its more stored steered towards liftouts and other but maybe give us an update of where youre how youre thinking about acquisition going forward clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah its still very much a part of our dna when we look at the individuals that have been part of our acquisition and integration teams over the last or years id say that weve had some folks that have retired but id say that a lot of our key leaders and those types of activities probably to of them are still with us so its definitely a skill set that we still possess we spend a lot of time modernizing our platforms and things over the columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 last few years and really started looking towards what the ma market might hold about this time last year and then covid hit and kind of shut everything down id just say that our history of being active in ma is still part of the part of our strategy and you know what i think that theres just nothing specific but i just think in general with and theres some pentup demand and i think theres an increased sense of urgency relative to the rate environment and need to improve operating leverage and grow revenue and so i think that thats going to accelerate as we get further beyond the pandemic and our goal is always to at least be part of the conversation so when somebody reaches the point where theyre ready to find a partner our goal is always to at least have them pick up the phone and give us a call so i dont know if thats helpful but thats kind of how we do it jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co all right thanks clint operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your question please jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone afternoon i guess clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes that means i get to ask questions by the way i mean the queue is light behind me so ill start but anyway maybe andy a question for you appreciate all the commentary on the stressed portfolios if you had to consolidate all of that are you more optimistic less pessimistic or do you still have things that keep you awake at night it feels like things are better and it kind of looks like that from your economic factors in your reserving but give us a big picture of your consolidated thoughts on that andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah so i think obviously the general healthcare portfolios played out like we thought and so we feel very good about those the hotel portfolio has performed exceptionally well i would say and i think that has to do with the fact that we have more leisurerelated hotel exposure than we do business travel and i alluded that in my comments jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 and then yeah i have to be pretty happy with the rest of the portfolio but the two that i continue to be concerned with and i think this is consistent is restaurant and retail and that really has to do with the government closures and our footprint and many of those are small businesses and i think it will have a very detriment so many of them got closed early in the year they got closed at the end of last year and they remain closed now or if theyre open its very limited of what they could do prior to so those two segments are the ones that i continue to have i guess more focus on and concerned than the other segments which i think is performing quite well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay the path on maybe this is a aaron andy question but the path to get back to maybe where the reserve was as a percentage of loans earlier in the year is that just a natural evolution of the economy lending and things getting more comfortable andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i mean honestly under the cecl model we emphasized a large amount of reserves in the first half of and as i have discussed earlier our provision i think was really relatively unchanged as we go throughout i dont see a whole like any really big changes in that other than i see net chargeoffs materializing in the latter half of the year and into and that will bleed down the reserve we wont necessarily have to replenish that if the economy continues to move in a positive direction and so to your point yes it will be a natural evolution of how the reserve works jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good aaron maybe one for you you put a little bit of cash to work this quarter in securities and i think i understand that but talk to us a little bit about what you expect on the margin some of the puts and takes on the core margin i think with your new loan yields youre suggesting continued modest pressure but maybe with some of these loan growth production numbers the potential to outrun that so maybe kind of walk us through what we should think about in terms of how we model it aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc sure so jon we so we reported a margin for the fourth quarter the ppp impacted that in the quarter all in including both the interest earned on those the normal amortization amounts and the accelerated amortization of fees is included in that 5basis point benefit we also had 5basis point benefit from the interest recovery that we had on a nonaccrual loan of million and then theres two cmbs prepays that added about basis points so you can kind of take out all that i guess get some measure of maybe where the core will be though i wouldnt say that its not entirely uncommon to have some prepay benefits on the portfolio just given that we do have a number of portfolios that kind of match those characteristics but as you noted going forward the rate where new production is coming down relative to the portfolio will be detrimental to the margin in the third quarter excluding all the kind of ppp noise the rates on the loan portfolio was in the fourth quarter that dropped down to new production coupons are around so its theres going to be a continued headwind there columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 similarly on the securities portfolio excluding the benefit of those prepays the yield on that broker spread at just as in the portfolio when we had a very busy quarter on that front as you noted with having brought about billion in new securities the yields on that was so again its going to in a continued way and things going forward so long as we continue to remain in this extremely low rate environment hopefully we have seen a little bit of lift in the ph tenure recently and hopefully that sticks and continues to build and hopefully the ultimately we get higher rates on the short end as well if we continue to progress through the economic recovery as expected but were not counting on any benefit from that any time soon but i think we kind of take where the new stuffs is coming on and yeah that should give you a sense of the kind of pressure that will probably likely continue to see through here notwithstanding all the additional noise that were going to see from ppp jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay all right appreciate the help thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler your question please matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone on the new money yields at on the loan side at million i guess im a little surprised at how low they are is that just a mixed issue this quarter where we might see a little bit higher rate going forward or is that just kind of the new thats where the competition is christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah matt this is chris and youre kind of sad there at the end tells me that were all kind of thinking the same way maybe a lot of it is the competitive environment the massive amounts of liquidity are out there the challenges of when you find good credit is its extremely competitive and so we steer away consistently from anything that involves structures that were uncomfortable with terms that were uncomfortable with but were going to have to compete on rates sometimes in that and so some of it also is the mix you bring on some large deals during the quarter those come on at a little lower rate generally and going forward i would anticipate that were probably looking at this for a while and its going to take a little sorting out as competitors are entering or maybe pulling back from the market based on how their portfolios perform but i would expect that the competition continues especially for highquality credit deals matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay makes sense and then on the as it relates to the disruption in your markets are you at the point where youve already started to identify individuals or teams or is that still a ways out christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc you cut out a little bit there so was question how we identified teams and have we brought on new talent matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 yeah have you already identified teams at this stage and if so are you looking for a certain type of specialty lenders or is it just your general commercial banker with seasoned books of business christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc sure its always in process and we go with the philosophy of were recruiting all the time and you never know when somebody is going to be ready to make that move and so if we know the individuals we know the markets that theyre in weve got a good idea of their books and what they do then well be opportunistic when the time is right now there and weve got special fees and things of that nature that is certainly to the core of how we operate and if we can locate somebody they are interested in joining us and they bring a new niche were absolutely interested in that if its somebody that fits into an existing niche that we knew weve been competing against we know them we respect them we ph know about quality bankers well add them into that piece some of our markets were pretty widespread between metropolitan areas and rural areas as you get farther away from the metropolitan areas you tend to get more generalists and some of them however do ph have specialties and so its kind of a long way around and were open to any and all and were constantly looking matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then can you just remind us how much you have in the way of net ppprelated revenue to come through from round one aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc what was remaining at december matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yes aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc it was million in remaining net fees to be amortized matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator our next question comes from jacque bohlen with kbw your question please jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning everyone columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi jacque jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i was just curious on the driver of the loan purchase this quarter was that driven by looking to ph some of the runoff or was it just an attractive portfolio that came across your desk clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc kind of both its more of we have a portfolio of mortgage and its a fair bit of that obviously is paying down given how rates are so it was a little bit of refilling of that but and i would just highlight that were also producing a great deal and what were producing doesnt always necessarily match what we want to hold on our own balance sheet so the amount that weve purchased is certainly far below what we actually produced and sold during the quarter i dont know if chris has anything to add to that but jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so just balancing kind of overall competition within that portfolio with the driver clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then touching back on the ma topic im just wondering if you could provide us a refresher with what youre looking for in terms of a partner in terms of maybe how small or how big you might be looking to go and also if northern california still remains of interest to you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah its we say its got to be a cultural fit and weve said that indiscernible one of our criteria we start with the balance sheet and look at their business model because if its a very different business model than what we have its probably going to culturally be very hard to bring the two organizations together theres the sizing is a bit of a moving target if you will because i think it depends on if its a bank that has a really good niche that is additive to what we do it could be on the smaller side and that would give itd be something that maybe we could look at and build upon an example indiscernible from a size standpoint that pacific continental fit into this but pacific continental has a national healthcare platform thats very complementary we felt at the time and three years later its proven itself out that its very complementary to what we were doing in the healthcare front in our existing market so if theres a bank thats on the smaller side that has something like that that would be indiscernible fillin and there are some fillin opportunities within our existing footprints that might cause us to look towards the smaller side of it columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 theres obviously ones where you have a lot of market overlap and it gets better operating leverage and but those are going to typically be on the larger end of it and then as it relates to all of those things if it provides entry into a new market thats also something that we would evaluate and has to be that cultural fit first and foremost but then what else does it bring to us entry into a new market its something wed take a very close look at and specific to northern california weve been studying that market for several years now we like that what weve learned about the market its very similar in a lot of ways to indiscernible and even as you get into the more metro areas of not necessarily san francisco proper but in and around the bay area and those markets theyre pretty similar to portland seattle so this is something that we think is still of interest and we continue to just learn more as much as we can about the market and who the quality bankers are in that market jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you clint that was great overview clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jacque operator thank you and our last question comes from david feaster with raymond james your question please david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everybody its great to see the acceleration in originations in the quarter im just curious where youre seeing growth is it from existing clients that are continuing to invest is it new clients from the ppp program or the new indiscernible or even the neighborhood concept and just kind of the pulse of your clients as we entered do you kind of get the sense that theyre ready to invest in expansion capex and we could see accelerating growth throughout the year or your client is still a bit cautious given the uncertainty christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah david this is chris i can tell you i think its a mix in there ph they look at some of our markets and they havent had governmental closures and things of that nature so theyre operating much different the originations are purely across the footprint those are in companies that didnt experience a downturn or things of that nature they are being opportunistic as you said and theyre looking to make investments now some of its purchasing their own building things of that nature but id tell you its a mix between current clients and new now we were one of the institutions ph did in the first round of ppp we did not ph extend it as a marketing tool and we didnt take on nonclients in that manner however we are seeing people coming to us after the fact and things that we are winning during the fourth quarter has come from just our bankers efforts and their continued effort to stay in front of prospects we brought on some other investment types of things that are ultimately turning into opportunities which has been good to see as you start looking towards the year i think its a little bit of a mix there too youve got if you look at the second round of ppp and what the requirements were to enter that theres a lot of companies out there that are doing ph very well and are not eligible to reapply theyre going to have different columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 opportunities to seek out investments or whatever it may be for their business then those that are reapplying ph this go around that really need that stimulus and that support so well have to see how this next round really plays itself out i think the story really is the momentum that we had talked about building we saw a lot of it hit in the fourth quarter im typically always cautiously optimistic that we can continue that a lot of our bankers a lot of our back office ph loan ops things of that nature our sleeves are rolled up and working extremely hard right now on the second round and thats a distraction but again there is also new business thats out there at the same time so were really balancing that out and trying to keep the momentum from the fourth quarter going but there is a bit of a distraction and thats going to continue for a little bit here david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then just on the fee income front the countercyclicality of some of these business lines has been a huge help in a challenging environment just curious how you think about fee income is there ph any other initiative that youd be interested in expanding into whether organically or through ma and just how you think about fee income and potentially expanding that fee income contribution aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah this is aaron ill start just because i do want to highlight that during the quarter we had indiscernible that there was almost fair value adjustment on the mortgage loan pipeline so just that indiscernible volatility but and i dont mean to take away from the tremendous activity that weve had in mortgage because that team has just been doing a fantastic job but beyond that ill turn it over to chris to add anything else on the ph seafront christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah i think theres are we looking for other areas thats always something thats under consideration weve explored a lot of things havent found anything thats truly a fit that goes to doesnt change who we are who weve been and with that said we have ph cd financial we have our trust group and those teams continue to grow and improve was off to a tremendous start and then the pandemic hit and a little bit of a dip in the middle there but they closed the year strong and what were seeing in that business is a real demand for people to participate in financial planning and look at possibly business sales and things of that nature as we start to come out of this so optimistic in that area the mortgage group continues to do a great job as ph was mentioned its a little bit more rate contingent as rates start to rise thatll certainly change the refinance aspect of that but to date it hasnt that hasnt happened and they continue to come in so optimistic there as well i think when you look into some of the things like card revenue and some of the other feebased types of situations its a little bit up in the air still as the economy opens up as the vaccines become more prevalent as people basically where im going is as people start to spend money we should see those return just dont know yet if thats going to return to prepandemic levels or is something going to be different how has consumer behavior changed the rest of it id say is kind of business as usual we still participate in kind of swaps and other fee sources such as that but again always open to looking and considering something that were not columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 currently doing or how we could possibly expand what were currently doing in the investment world or something of that nature david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then just could you just talk about your asset sensitivity here you guys are naturally assetsensitive and it seems like the asset sensitivity might have increased just given the building liquidity and significant proportion of loans that are repricing here in the next six months ph are just about the impact of floors but just kind of putting it all together how do you think about that and how do you plan to manage your rate sensitivity and maybe does that give you some confidence to potentially take on some duration in the securities book aaron james deer a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc well weve done just that actually ph theres new things and during the quarter weve purchased billion in securities with net growth of a little over million the and we have i should say weve attempted to put a little more duration on there i think what weve purchased had about years duration on average if i recall correctly but it didnt extend the overall portfolio duration that materially were still below five years there and in doing so we arguably have taken some asset sensitivity off the table to generate a little better interest income near term rather than letting that all sit in cash but i think thats the right decision we still have an enormous liquidity position and that book alone is going to be throwing off around million a year in cash flows which we hope to redeploy into higher yield and loans as loan growth comes back in a more material way so i would say we are arguably a little less assetsensitive today than we were three months ago but its i still think were extremely wellpositioned for rise in rates i mean the real secret there is our cost of funds and theres our deposits are just phenomenal ph amidst a very low cost of deposits and thats going to serve us extremely well if we want to eventually indiscernible david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great thanks operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our qa and program for today we thank you for your participation in todays conference and you may now disconnect good day columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021
