quarterly results were strong and we reported billion in net income or per share inside of this we grew deposits and loans increased our capital and liquidity positions generated positive operating leverage and maintained strong credit quality the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 for the past month weve seen market volatility across the broader industry and while we take this situation seriously and are closely monitoring the environment its important to note that these events have taken place within a few banks with very unique business models inside of our company we really havent seen any meaningful impacts from the events of the past month our balance sheet remains strong and stable and we are operating the company in the same way we were at the beginning of march ultimately over time we expect the dynamics playing out in the banking system today to contribute to changes in the competitive landscape and while its still early innings we believe that pnc will be a beneficiary from this process that said in the near term were not immune to the competitive environment and the deposit dynamics that will ultimately impact our nii in the near term and robs going to cover that in more detail in a second we remain focused on growing relationships across our lines of business and we continued to execute on key priorities including the expansion in the bbva legacy markets rob will provide more details on our financial performance in a moment however for this particular call hell review our first quarter earnings in a slightly condensed manner to allow time to also cover key balance sheet focus points that have been top of mind for our investors in the last couple of weeks and of course following that well be able to discuss your specific questions in the qa segment finally id like to thank our employees for helping deliver a strong quarter and everything they do to support our customers now with that ill turn it over to rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis loans for the first quarter were billion an increase of billion or linked quarter investment securities were relatively stable at billion cash balances at the federal reserve averaged billion and increased billion during the quarter deposits of billion grew on both a spot and average basis linked quarter average borrowed funds increased billion which reflected fourth quarter activity as well as senior note issuances in january of this year at quarterend our tangible book value was per common share an increase of linked quarter and we remain well capitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of as of march during the quarter we returned billion of capital to shareholders which included million of common dividends and approximately million of share repurchases or million shares due to market conditions and increased economic uncertainty we expect to reduce our share repurchase activity in the second quarter and of course well continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate slide shows our loans and deposits in more detail during the first quarter loan balances averaged billion an increase of billion or largely reflecting the full quarter impact of growth in the fourth quarter of deposits averaged billion in the first quarter increasing billion the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 we continue to see a mix shift from noninterestbearing to interestbearing and i will cover that in more detail in a few minutes our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to during the first quarter from in the fourth quarter of and as of march our cumulative deposit beta was turning to the income statement on slide as you can see first quarter reported net income was billion or per share total revenues of billion decreased million compared to the fourth quarter of net interest income decreased million or primarily driven by two fewer days in the quarter and higher funding costs partially offset by higher yields on interestearning assets our net interest margin of declined basis points reflecting the increased funding costs i just mentioned noninterest income also declined or million as growth in asset management and brokerage was more than offset by a general slowdown in capital markets activity as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes first quarter expenses declined million or linked quarter even after accounting for the increase to the fdics deposit assessment rate which equated to million provision was million in the first quarter and included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality and our effective tax rate was turning to slide we highlight our revenue and expense trends as a result of our diversified revenue streams and expense management efforts we generated positive operating leverage of linked quarter and compared to the same period a year ago and as we previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by million in through our continuous improvement program and were confident we will achieve our full year target and as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans remained stable at billion and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies of billion declined million or linked quarter notably the delinquency rate of basis points is our lowest level in over a decade net chargeoffs were million a decrease of million linked quarter our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans ratio was basis points in the first quarter and our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on march essentially stable with yearend before i provide an update on our forward guidance as bill mentioned we want to take a deeper dive into some of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits securities and swaps capital and liquidity and the impact of potential regulatory changes and finally office exposure within our commercial real estate portfolio in our view we believe were well positioned across all these key areas of focus turning to slide our billion deposit base is broken down between consumer and commercial categories to give you a view of the composition and granularity of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter our deposits were consumer and commercial inside of our billion of consumer deposits approximately are fdic insured the portfolio is very granular with an average account balance of approximately across nearly million accounts throughout our coasttocoast franchise our billion of commercial deposits are insured but importantly approximately of the total balances are held in operating and relationship accounts these include deposits held as compensating balances to pay for treasury management fees escrow deposits at midland loan services and broader relationship the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 accounts all of which tend to provide more stability than depositonly accounts importantly we have approximately million commercial deposit accounts representing a diverse set of industries and geographies turning to slide we highlight our mix of noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits our consumer deposits noninterestbearing mix has been stable remaining at compared to the same period a year ago the commercial side is where we expected to see a continued shift from noninterestbearing into interestbearing deposits as rates have risen and that has played out albeit at a somewhat faster pace than we had expected the commercial noninterestbearing portion of total deposits was as of march down from a year ago importantly commercial noninterestbearing deposits include the compensating balances in midland escrow deposits i mentioned previously which provides support to this mix through time on a consolidated basis our level of noninterestbearing deposits was at the end of the first quarter of down from a year ago pnc has historically operated with a higher percentage of noninterestbearing deposits relative to the banking industry due in part to strength of our treasury management business and granular deposit base as a result we expect our noninterestbearing portion of deposits to continue to exceed industry averages and approach the mid20 range by yearend in addition to our mix shift we have seen a faster increase in our deposit costs this year as the federal reserve has continued to raise shortterm interest rates slide shows our recent trends and our current expectations for deposit betas through the end of the increase in our current deposit beta expectations are largely driven by recent events that have increased the intensity and focus on rates paid and ultimately has added incremental pricing pressure sooner than we previously expected we expect the federal reserve to raise the benchmark rate by basis points in may this coupled with heightened competition for deposits has accelerated our expectations for the level and pace of beta increase and we now expect to reach a terminal beta of by yearend slide details our investment securities and swap portfolios our securities balance averaged billion in the first quarter and were relatively stable linked quarter the yield on our securities portfolio increased basis points to as we continue to replace runoff at higher reinvestment rates yields on new purchases during the quarter exceeded our portfolio is high quality and positioned with a short duration of years meaningfully shorter than many of our peers approximately twothirds of our securities are recorded as held to maturity and onethird as available for sale average security balances represent approximately of interestearning assets our received fixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book remained largely stable at billion in notional value and 225year duration at the end of the first quarter our accumulated other comprehensive loss improved by billion or to billion driven by the impact of lower interest rates during the quarter and normal accretion as the securities and swaps pull to par slide highlights the pace of expected security and swap maturities as well as the related aoci runoff by the end of we expect about of our securities and swaps to roll off this will drive increases in our securities and commercial loan yields as well as meaningful tangible book value improvement as we expect approximately aoci accretion by the end of year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 slide highlights our strong liquidity position our strong liquidity coverage ratios continued to improve in the first quarter and exceeded regulatory requirements throughout the quarter our cash balances at the federal reserve totaled billion and we maintained substantial unused borrowing capacity and flexibility through other funding sources pnc has a robust liquidity management process which includes a required statutory daily liquidity coverage ratio assessment as well as a monthly net stable funding ratio calculation in addition we perform monthly internal liquidity stress testing that covers a range of time horizons as well as systemic and idiosyncratic stress scenarios our mix of borrowed funds to total liabilities has historically averaged approximately and reached an unprecedented low level of in on march our mix was and we expect to move closer to the historical average over time in light of the current environment we anticipate that we will be subject to a total loss absorbing capacity requirement in some form and at some point with a reasonable phasein period importantly as our borrowed funds continue to return to a more normalized level we would expect to be compliant through our current issuance plans under existing tlac requirements slide shows our solid capital position with an estimated cet1 ratio of at quarterend as a category iii institution we dont include aoci in our cet1 ratio but understand why there is focus on this ratio with the inclusion of aoci as of march our cet1 ratio including aoci was estimated to be which remains above our required level taking into account our current stress capital buffer however we also believe its important to take a look at the balance sheet positioning of a bank from a market value of equity perspective similar to our understanding of basel irrbb rules market value of equity doesnt truly get reflected on the balance sheet today due to generally accepted accounting principles which results in a skewed approach of valuing certain items primarily on the asset side while aoci takes into account the current valuation of the securities and certain portions of our swap portfolios it does not account for the valuation of the deposit book which can be a meaningful offset in a rising interest rate environment in fact looking at pncs change in market value of equity over the past year the increase in the market value of our deposits in a rapidly rising interest rate environment has significantly outpaced all unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet including securities and fixed rate loans total market value of equity increased substantially in the rising rate environment and further our duration of equity is now essentially zero and well positioned in the current environment importantly our models use conservative assumptions regarding estimates for betas mix balances and deposit lives we also recognized early on that large inflows of deposits during the pandemic were driven by a combination of qe and fiscal stimulus which were likely to be shortlived recall our fed balances peaked in the first quarter of around billion as a result we modeled an economic value associated with those deposits at a fraction of the value of core deposits turning to slide i wanted to spend a few minutes talking about our commercial real estate portfolio while credit quality is strong across the majority of our cre book office is the segment receiving a lot of attention in this environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates so we thought it would be worthwhile to highlight our exposure and our position with this portfolio at the end of the first quarter we had billion or of our total loans in our office portfolio the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 turning to slide you can see the composition of this portfolio which is well diversified across geography tenant type and property classification reserves against these loans which we have built over several quarters now total a level that we believe adequately covers expected losses in regard to our underwriting approach we adhere to conservative standards focus on attractive markets and work with experienced wellcapitalized sponsors the office portfolio was originated with an approximate loan to value of to and a significant majority of those properties are defined as class a we have a highly experienced team that is reviewing each asset in the portfolio to set appropriate action plans and test reserve adequacy we dont solely rely on thirdparty appraisals which will naturally be slow to adjust to the rapidly shifting market conditions rather we are stress testing property performance to set realistic expectations to appropriately sensitize our portfolio we significantly discounted net operating income levels and property values across the entire office book additionally tenant retention buildout costs and concession levels are all updated to accurately reflect market conditions credit quality in our office portfolio remains strong today with only of loans delinquent nonperforming and a net chargeoff rate of basis points over the last months along those lines we continue to see solid performance within the single tenant medical and government loans which represent of our total office portfolio these have occupancy levels above and watchlist levels of or less where we do see increasing stress and a rising level of criticized assets is in our multitenant loans which represents of our office portfolio multitenant loans are currently running in the mid70 occupancy range watchlist levels are greater than and of the portfolio is scheduled to mature by the end of in the near term this is our primary concern area as it relates to expected losses and by extension comprises the largest portion of our office reserves multitenant reserves on a standalone basis are obviously well continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect realtime market conditions for each of the key areas of focus i just discussed we believe we are well positioned and slide summarizes our balance sheet strength during this volatile time our deposits are up our capital and liquidity positions are strong and our overall credit quality is solid in summary pnc reported a strong first quarter in regard to our view of the overall economy we are expecting a recession starting in the second half of resulting in a decline in real gdp our rate path assumption includes a basis point increase in the fed funds rate in may following that we expect the fed to pause rate actions until early when we expect a basis point cut looking ahead our outlook for full year compared to results is as follows we expect spot loan growth of to which equates to average loan growth of to total revenue growth to be up to inside of that our expectation is for net interest income to be up to at this point visibility remains challenging and our full year nii guidance assumes the continuation of the recent intensity on deposit pricing which is being driven by recent events we expect noninterest income to be stable expenses to be up to and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately based on this guidance we expect we will generate positive operating leverage in the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 looking at the second quarter of compared to the first quarter of we expect average loans to be stable net interest income to be down to fee income to be stable to down other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities and visa activity taking all the component pieces we expect total revenue to decline approximately we expect total noninterest expense to be up to and we expect second quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million further given our strong credit metrics our credit quality is trending better than our expectations and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning betsy william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc first off i just want to say your slide deck is phenomenal i just you answered so many of the questions that i had coming into this i felt like you were reading my mind ahead of this call robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc could have been could have been yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thank you the team did a nice job putting that together thank you for recognizing that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 no it was great you guys that was a great job i have two questions one is on the deposit beta when youre talking about the obviously that is aligned with the outlook that you just expressed for interest rate movements i guess i wanted to just understand how youre thinking about the flex between deposit beta and deposit growth because part of me says hey i could have expected even more deposit growth than you gave me qq and is there a rate paid element to that that maybe youre holding back on and thats why the deposits werent maybe as high as what some folks like me had hoped william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were sitting here puzzled we grew deposits average and spot against a backdrop of absent the volatility in the market deposits still overall leaving the system particularly government money funds and then the shrinkage of the total on the back robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc with qt william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc qt our rate paid if you look yearonyear i think our total deposits are down or something which is less than most anybody wed compare to and we have purposefully been protecting the franchise in the course of doing that i recognize some other people dont do that and thats well see how that plays out through time but i we kind of feel we outperformed on deposits so im a little bit robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc in the first quarter william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc puzzled by your question yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no qq definitely and i would expect after all of the banks finish reporting we can have a better conversation on this i was just wondering if you felt that if you had a slightly higher rate paid would you have pulled in more and i suppose the way you answered that question is you dont feel the need to so thats great and then just separately as a fallout of what has happened with sivb signature et cetera do you feel like theres any need at all to reassess the duration of the commercial operating account deposit liability life is that something that having seen what happened at sivb you would want to take a closer look at or do you feel like its just such a different animal given what you outlined on slide with the granularity youve got thanks the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well first of all we look at that all the time and as rob put into his comments a large portion of the deposit growth that we saw through covid so stimulus in the fed the growth in the feds balance sheet we just assumed had a life of a day zero because were in an abnormal period of time the core operating deposits that we have particularly as you go in the middle market are basically the working capital monies that companies use to run their companies we truncate and always have truncated the modeled lives of those deposits well below what the practical experience would show us yeah so its conservative robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and deposits that are spread out over diverse industries and diverse geographies william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its in accounts you almost cant compare what happened at silicon valley and signature to any other bank ive ever seen in terms of the concentration of the deposit accounts and robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and the nature of the clients william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc just the nature of them i mean a lot of that money was its capital raise money that was sitting there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right okay thats super thank you so much appreciate it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator our next question from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess this question goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished your operating leverage in the first quarter yearoveryear was over youve guided for positive operating leverage this year of to your cycletodate beta i estimate being below so all that looks really good but on the other hand you did i guess lower your guidance for how much positive operating leverage this year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 you mentioned nii you mentioned the intensity on deposit pricing so just can you help talk about the tradeoff of pursuing growth with more deposits versus maybe scaling back if that deposit pricing is really that much more intense or do you see that not being so at some point william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think mike part of the issue that we face here is you have a interest rate forward curve thats suggesting cuts out there so if you believe that betas would be less we kind of think the feds going to hold through the year and cut next year personally i think they might hold longer than that so everybodys nii guide is going to be all over the place depending on what they actually think the feds doing as we go into this the back end of this year separately we have seen just this heightened awareness of interest rates and what you do with deposits on the back of the banks that failed youve seen the growth in the government money funds on the back of the feds reverse repo facility which is a real thing as long as they allow that to keep growing theyre at the market deposits but theyre basically getting drained from the banking system and making liquidity more expensive so thats we took all that into account and said look if rates are higher for longer if the fed keeps draining deposits through its reverse repo facility the smaller banks really need to pay up super high rates to fund their balance sheets its going to be painful for us and thats what we put in our guide that may or may not happen robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and i would just add weve got a focus on our core franchise and our clients so on the commercial side its really the effect of commercial clients choosing to switch to interestbearing from noninterestbearing william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and the relationships fully intact and then on the consumer side as bill just mentioned the interestbearing deposits and the pressure around rates paid there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and the one other point you guys have made is that either nii will be better or you might have to you might get to release some of your credit reserves have you seen any improvement in that loan pricing commensurate with some of the standards in the capital markets youre pricing for risk a lot more in the lending markets you have not been pricing for risk and you brought william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc that up before are you seeing that at all or still not yet william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc our new production is a little bit better than it was but in fairness at the moment credit looks much better than we otherwise would have assumed so its a tradeoff now its going to be interesting mike because the marginal cost of funds for the us banking system has just gone up a lot as a result of this flurry and so all else equal you would expect credit spreads to widen here simply because the cost of funds for all banks has gone up i havent seen that play out yet but it continues to be at least my expectation that it will mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi guys how are you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill can you give us you guys pointed out about rob the expectations on tlac in your prepared remarks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc but can you guys give us some color on what changes may come as a result of the signature and silicon valley bank failures the regulators look like theyre going to reassess the situation and well get the postmortem on may of course but what do you guys think may happen in terms of additional requirements for regional banks like yours and i know tlac youre already planning on that but outside of tlac william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 i dont know what it is they might do theres a lot of talk around should they eliminate the available for sale optin or optout for robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc aoci william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah aoci for banks our size and they may well do that part of me though the reason we put economic value of equity in our presentation is as soon as you start isolating specific fixed rate assets and ignore others so what do you do with fixed rate whole loan mortgages what do you do with held to its all the same stuff its an accounting entry and so i would hope that they would have a more holistic look as they do in europe on measuring balance sheet risk to interest rates i dont know where thats going to end up and whatever it is they do is going to take a period of time tlac i think is a certainty at this point its a function of how much itll be and whether its varied as a function of size and complexity of bank robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and theres some tailoring right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no and bill and rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc those are the gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah go ahead rob go ahead robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc i was just going to say those are the two prominent subjects tlac and aoci inclusion gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it no the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc by the way the issue its just its worth mentioning basic interest rate risk management and the test around liquidity that banks go through i mean we did this we run this stuff every single day with all sorts of different scenarios and that the regulators require us to and we get measured on it indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and look i dont even know who was looking at these other banks so to come in and say we ought to do more were already doing it is i guess my point gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very clear and im glad you guys put the whole balance sheet the equity valuation because that message has to get out and im glad you guys did that so thank you moving on to commercial and industrial loans you guys have seen really good growth over the past year can you give us a little more color on do you see a reintermediation coming into the banking system because the capital markets are still disrupted or is it just you guys have had success with bbva and thats working for you can you give us some color on that growth that youre seeing william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc a couple of comments if you look back through our history when we enter new markets this is particularly through back through rbc and what weve seen with bbva we tend to grow loans at a pace in the new markets that would be above what you would expect in a longterm trend and then over time we crosssell into those new relationships so i almost think of it as its kind of advertising dollars you otherwise participate in a deal on the hope that youre going to get ph tm revenue and other things what well see going forward is the crosssell into the new relationships weve established the ability to continue to grow loans at that pace should we choose to is probably still there do you get paid for it today the way you did when rates were much lower robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc not so much william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc is a tougher question now the whole reintermediation in the banks from capital markets ive heard some of that buzz by the way ive heard the buzz the other way all else equal i suspect the longterm trend will be less the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 in the banking system and more out of the banking system over a long long period of time notwithstanding what happens in the near future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it very helpful thank you and to really reiterate what betsy said great deck thank you very much robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thanks gerard operator next question from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi and i agree on the slide deck very very helpful detail thanks for giving it on the deposit front just a couple additional bit of detail the beta expectation the terminal beta looks a little bit more conservative than the group and probably appropriately so so its good to see it can you maybe give us how that breaks down by way of commercial deposit beta expectation at this point versus consumer robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure yeah sure yeah sure hey john good morning its rob the way that we look at it in terms of determining where were going to end up and again its an expectation well see how it plays out ultimately but youre on the right track so if you take a look at our total deposits of billion and you take commercial and the high net worth the consumer portion which is high net worth which is around billion those betas have moved theyre already at terminal its done so that leaves roughly billion or so in consumer deposits as i mentioned in my comments of those are noninterestbearing which are transactional accounts so we dont expect a change so youre at billion the minority of our total deposits of interestbearing consumer deposits that are sort of in play and that we expect the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 to pay higher rates on so thats how we get to maybe a more conservative number than what youre seeing on peers that dont have the same mix john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thats helpful also on the deposit front if i could also a little more detail on the amount of inflows that you may have seen during the march time period around the failures can you maybe quantify the amount and if you expect any outflow of any of those inflows that you saw robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so we did see in midmarch we saw some inflows during that week that at the height of the disruption but a lot of thats settled out so we dont expect to see that be a factor for us positively or negatively as we move into the second quarter william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the only thing id say we actually opened in march twice the number of accounts in our ci franchise that we would otherwise open in a month so away from the deposits that came in we actually got a bunch of clients robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the deposits will stay and get mixed some will go but we grew our account portfolio pretty substantially in one month john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great if i could put one more in there just on the office front do you happen to have perhaps the refreshed ltvs that youre starting to see in that portfolio william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thats a good question and i havent seen them but its worth i dont know we put in the deck or not but we underwrite to what to robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 yeah and all of that stuff is stale and all of the appraisals that you get are stale and so in effect what we end up doing is you assume that less leases renew than you otherwise would in a normal cash flow analysis you drop that pretty materially you assume that lease rates all else equal are going to go down and then you have to put in the rehab costs to release it and then you discount at a lower rate so weve done all that building by building robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and then taking reserves against it and i guess a final point id make you think about robs number it was a we have against robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc in the multitenant right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc multitenant effectively youre saying all right i can have of class a office default and lose on the dollar on a portfolio that was originally underwritten at thats a pretty severe outcome robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi agreed robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and i would just add to that john john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and bill mentioned it we have a relatively small portfolio so were able to go asset by asset rather than just broad strokes across a general portfolio the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look we know how to do this right but weve been in the business for a long time we have all the resources and have seen the activity in midland we know all the borrowers were with and we think weve laid it out pretty clearly were going to have chargeoffs but weve recognized robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thats why weve built the reserves william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc where theyre coming from and weve built the reserves john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it very helpful thank you operator next question from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob i wanted to follow up on the deposit beta commentary rob you mentioned that mid20 noninterestbearing deposit mix thats implicit i believe in your robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc terminal beta assumption and it looks like that would get you back to precovid levels on slide i think how are you thinking about the risk that that noninterestbearing mix will continue to fall not just to precovid levels but potentially even lower perhaps some have talked about indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its a good question yeah we can see and we take a look at the nature of the accounts mid is our estimate it could go lower our expectations are though that it would be in the mid and thats really on the basis of the nature of the operating accounts that we have that is we just were mentioning we know really well and we know the nature of their activities so its really the knowledge of our operating book that gives us that indication bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 understood and then separately following up on your commentary around potential regulatory uncertainty in light of indiscernible recent senate testimony so hoping you could address broadly how youre all thinking about the levers at your disposal to the extent that the regulatory environment grows more challenging certainly your it seems like youre well positioned but in terms of levers whether its rwa growth buyback dividend if you could just frame how you think about those to the extent that it does get more challenging william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc not sure if you put aoci in were already kind of over the threshold all else equal i think were well positioned and fine as rob mentioned were at least at the moment being conservative on our thoughts on share repurchase but most of that is to kind of wait out the current environment get through earnings and see where we are i dont see any issue coming out of regulation that we wont be able to handle in the due course robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and that would largely be in the obvious areas of capital and liquidity where were strong bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc next question please operator next question from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you for taking the question so you reduced the full year loan growth expectation a bit i was wondering if you could comment for a second on how much of that is sort of lower either existing or anticipated demand and how much is you guys just sort of being more conservative about where youd hope to kind of direct your capital and liquidity william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its a great question its probably so demand has softened a little bit and then the marginal cost of ph sinky new clients has gone up so were a little more picky than we were its probably robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and that spread issue that we talked about that we william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 we think that we should be paid more for the risk r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then bill i was hoping you could expand just a bit on that commercial account opening comment you made a couple of questions ago william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co maybe as you sort of think of how the sort of the world might look going forward for commercial customers do you think theyll just maybe diversify their relationships to protect themselves a little how will an operational account work will people just keep less in their operational accounts and sprinkle it elsewhere any thoughts on how things might evolve william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im not sure we havent seen anything with our legacy clients in terms of behavior now theyve weve seen money go into sweep accounts government funds from corporates and individuals largely is a function of rate i dont know that it has anything to do with diversification now as you go for smaller banks i suppose that could become an issue depending on how much visibility there is into that particular banks balance sheet but we just havent seen any of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay all right perfect and thank you very much william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator next question from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone hey guys i just want to dig on the guidance a little bit the second quarter guidance is clear for the revenue stepdown and kind of that implies in the full year guide that second half revenue is pretty equal to first half revenue im just wondering if you can kind of maybe give us some nii versus fees and are you expecting any just better stability or increase as you go through the year perhaps in fees versus what might happen in nii thanks the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2023 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc okay i think youre asking in terms of the full year so weve given you the new guidance around our nii and then weve been through that as far as fees go were calling it to be stable yearoveryear and theres some moving parts in there some of the fee categories are doing a little better than we expected some are doing a little bit worse but altogether its still stable ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and within that can i just ask you a question your harris williams business has just been a great one over the years in this environment obviously ma is slower but is there also robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc is there any sense or chance that also like midsized companies have to do a rethink here im just kind of wondering just where you think the pipelines and outlook are for that business specifically thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so harris williams youre accurate in terms of thats our biggest driver of our capital marketsadvisory businesses and they had a slowerthanusual quarter in the first quarter obviously reflecting a lot of the disruption and the pipelines are still pretty good were not expecting a big rebound in the second quarter but potentially in the second half but to your point a lot of that depends on the psychology at the time and the ability and the support for both buyers and sellers to do deals ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay hey rob one more quick one i know your footnote on your beta slide says that you dont include time deposits in your beta calcs are we generally to assume that the beta on time deposits is obviously very high just given what we know to the earlier point that bill made about industry funding costs robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right and again thats a conventional measure so thats not our own personal pnc measure thats how the industry calculates it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood thank you the pnc financial services group
