turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian and hello everyone we appreciate you joining us for todays call early this morning we reported first quarter revenues of billion and earnings per share of im pleased to say that our overall core business performance was slightly better than our expectations with credit performance continuing to be bestin class and were especially encouraged about the progress were making toward our aspiration of returning to the original eps expectations we had for in as i discussed in january were looking at as a transition year where our focus is on investing to rebuild growth momentum but firing up our core business scaling next horizon opportunities while continuing to retain financial flexibility and while i feel good about our results for the quarter what i feel really good about is the progress were making to rebuild momentum when we talk about firing up core were looking for meaningful progress in four areas spending volumes coming back to prepandemic levels bringing new customers into the franchise retaining and deepening relationships with our current customers and signing up additional merchants were making good progress in all these areas overall spending on american express cards in q1 continued the sequential improvements we saw through the last two quarters of us volumes exceeded our expectations in the quarter and spending in march from us consumer and small and medium size enterprise customers was higher than march levels nonus volume lagged a bit due to renewed lockdowns in certain international countries american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 excluding travel and entertainment categories spending on our cards in q1 was up on an fxadjusted basis versus levels this marked a third straight quarter of positive growth and although the te volumes were significantly lower in the first quarter versus last year weve seen a steady sequential upward trend in monthly te spending and a noticeable improvement in recent weeks particularly in the us as the vaccine rollout accelerated these trends indicate that the pentup demand for consumer travel weve been talking about is real and it increases our confidence that domestic consumer travel will continue to recover as the year progresses in terms of bringing new customers into the franchise card acquisitions are also gaining momentum and were up sequentially in the quarter globally in fact new accounts acquired on key premium us consumer and small business products were above levels and exceeded the prior quarters initial spending on these new cards is strong and the average fico scores of these new us consumer and small business card members are higher than those acquired prepandemic in addition card acquisitions in some of our largest travel cobrand portfolios have accelerated since the fourth quarter an important indicator that travel remains an attractive category for consumers over the longterm another indicator of building momentum in our core business is retaining and increasing engagement with existing card members we have a good story to tell here as well card member attrition on our proprietary products which also includes our cobrands continues to be lower than in the previous years and customer satisfaction levels remain higher than precovid levels the additional value we provided on several of our premium products helped drive card member loyalty and spending in and as we believed has been sustained into this year for example of us platinum card members who took advantage of the streaming credits and who used wireless credits offered last year are continuing to spend in these categories months later were also seeing good engagement on the new offers we rolled out earlier in the first quarter for platinum card members which includes statement credits with paypal and other select merchants the uptake on these offers are inline with the wireless and streaming offers we announced last year overall card member engagement with our digital channels and capabilities is at an alltime high in most areas for example over of our us card members are making their payments digitally and use our website or app for selfservice the number of amex offers redeemed in q1 increased fivefold versus last years first quarter topping million redemptions finally we continue to see strong adoption of pay it plan it our buy now pay later feature after we recently expanded the capability to all us consumer cards since launching pay it plan it card members have created over million plans totaling over billion of accounts receivable another key driver in momentum is expanding merchant coverage in the first quarter we continued to make progress growing merchant coverage internationally while maintaining our coverage levels in the us when it comes to building momentum we arent just focused on the near term were also focused on scaling next horizon opportunities that will drive growth over the longer term china represents an exciting opportunity in this regard as you know developing our card processing network in mainland china has been a priority for us and were pleased with our progress since getting the green light to start processing payments in china eight months ago we have reached mobile wallet parity coverage through our partnerships with chinese major mobile wallet providers and todate we have added over million merchants to the network at the pointofsale with more to come american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 a key enabler of our coverage growth in china is the progress were making to modernize our network particularly in adding the capability to process debit transactions globally which is an essential need for customers in china and helps us prepare for potential additional debit applications elsewhere we remain focused on scaling our china business by acquiring card members through the relationships weve established with issuing partners and i look forward to sharing more highlights of our progress over the course of the year in our commercial business our growth has been and will continue to be driven primarily by small and medium size enterprises a key element of our longerterm growth strategy for sme franchise is to deepen our relationships with current customers and attract new ones by offering a range of supplier payment and cash flow management solutions both on and beyond the card giving business owners more tools to help them manage their businesses kabbage is one example of how we plan to bring this strategy to life weve been focused on integrating kabbages digital capabilities into our business and in q1 we began the rollout of the kabbage platform which includes a business checking account and working capital solutions to our small business customers in our consumer business resy our online dining platform helps drive bookings and spending at restaurants which is a top category for our card members when the pandemic hit resy quickly pivoted its value proposition for restaurant owners to help them expand their offerings and find new ways to attract customers including enabling takeout meal kits family meals and virtual events resy also provided a number of special offers for amex card members as a result over the past year resy has seen significant growth in engagement for both consumers and restaurants in fact weve seen a number of reservations booked on the platform more than double since december and amex card members who use resy are some of our highest spending and most profitable customers those are just some of the examples of our progress in rebuilding our growth momentum both in our core business and with next horizon opportunities importantly as weve increased our investments in both categories weve also been focused on maintaining our financial strength and flexibility we resumed share repurchases this quarter and our capital ratios continue to be well above our targets before i hand the call over to jeff i want to share some thoughts on where i see things heading in the near term as i sit here a little over a year since the global covid pandemic started im optimistic that the hopeful signs were seeing as vaccine distribution accelerates will continue and get stronger as we move through the year of course were still cautiously keeping an eye on the progression of the virus and its impact on local lockdowns and cross border travel restrictions in certain areas but there are clear indicators that the economy is improving particularly in the us and i believe this will translate into continued steady improvements for american express given all of this we remain firmly committed to executing on our investment strategy for rebuilding growth momentum for the longer term as i said last quarter were not focused on achieving a particular eps target this year instead were focused on achieving our aspiration of returning to the original eps expectations we had for in and for the company to be positioned to execute on our financial growth algorithm going forward im encouraged by the results weve seen thus far in which makes me even more confident in our roadmap for achieving our aspiration im particularly proud of our colleagues who have remained nimble and focused through the uncertainties of the past year their dedication and hard work along with the flexibility of our business model the loyalty of our customer base the strength of our partnerships and the value of our brand make me feel very good about the future jeff will now walk you through our results and we will take questions after that american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 jeffrey c campbell chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results which reflect good progress towards the aspirations we have for that steve just outlined as ive said since the beginning of the pandemic last year the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends along with this year the marketing investments we are making to rebuild growth momentum ill spend most of my time this morning on these topics but first looking at the summary of financials on slide when you consider yearoveryear results last years first quarter included two months of prepandemic results and so as you would expect first quarter revenues of billion were down yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis but in contrast while we dont typically look at monthly results were you to look at our revenues in just the month of march youd see that they were up yearoveryear our first quarter net income was billion and earnings per share was included in these results is a billion credit reserve release due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and continued strong credit performance so now lets get into the first key driver of our performance volumes beginning with a few comments on some nomenclature changes we have made to our volume reporting thinking ahead on how we expect our card processing network in mainland china to grow in the coming quarters and years we have renamed what we previously called gs billed business as processed volumes because our business model in china is unique and different from what we do at our gs partners in other regions we have also changed what we previously referred to as proprietary billed business to just billed business and renamed what we used to call our overall volumes from billed business to network volumes you will see weve recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release as well as on appendix slide so with these changes in mind moving on to our volume performance on slide we saw continued recovery across all of our volumes in the first quarter with total network and billed business volumes down and respectively and processed volumes down only all on an fxadjusted basis getting into the details of our billed business growth which you will see several views of on slides through weve shown first quarter trends on both a yearoveryear basis and relative to in order to provide a clearer picture of how spending is recovering as we begin to lap the onset of the pandemic in march of last year i also note that the trends weve seen in the first two weeks of april are a continuation of the trends we saw exiting the first quarter that ill focus on this morning in addition it remains important to look at spending on travel and entertainment categories separately from spending in other categories which we will now be calling goods and services spending given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these two very different categories overall there are a few key points id suggest as the takeaways on volumes from all of these slides first there are clear signs of volume momentum that we feel good about as you can see on slide our overall billed business volume growth continued to recover steadily throughout the months of the first quarter with the reopening of the economy and rollout of the vaccines progressing well in the us and certain other geographies spending on goods and services which represents the vast majority or of our volumes exceeded our expectations growing yearoveryear and up versus in the quarter and up in the month of march spending on travel and entertainment also showed sequential improvement given the progress on the medical front in the us further reinforcing our view that consumer and small business travel will recover over time american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 second the growth in goods and services spending has continued to improve steadily in both our consumer and commercial businesses in consumer as shown on slide we continue to see strong online and card not present spend growth which was up yearoveryear this quarter even as the recovery of offline spending accelerated driving goods and services volumes up yearoveryear and versus in commercial as you can see on slide sme spending remains the most resilient across our customer types supported by continued growth in b2b spending which drove overall commercial spend on goods and services up year overyear and up versus in the first quarter third we are seeing a faster pace of spending recovery in the us versus other regions as shown on slide the total volumes from our us consumer and sme customers are recovering faster than other customer types and were up versus levels in the month of march even with the continued drag of te spend not yet fully recovering international consumer and sme spending on the other hand is recovering more slowly due to renewed restrictions in key international geographies and the fact that historically we tend to have more travel related spending in our international regions and large and global corporate card spending which historically has been primarily travel and entertainment continued to be down the most during the first quarter as we expected since this will be the last customer type to see travel recover fourth te spending though still down significantly did improve steadily across all categories throughout the months of the first quarter and consumer te continued to recover faster than that of smes and large corporations as you can see on slides and we expect this trend to continue given the pentup demand to travel that we see in our consumer base and the positive early signs of domestic travel recovery that we see in the us as the vaccine rollout progresses so to sum up on spending volumes we feel good about the steady growth we are seeing in goods and services spending and we expect it to continue to grow throughout on te spending the trends weve seen in the first quarter are encouraging and give us more confidence in our current assumption that by q4 te spending will have recovered to around of its q4 levels led by recovery in us consumer domestic travel turning next to the other key volume driver receivable and loan balances on slide receivable balances were down sequentially and yearoveryear in the first quarter in line with spending volumes loan balances however were down sequentially and yearoveryear more than spending volumes as we continued to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates which relates to the very strong credit performance ill talk about in just a moment looking forward i would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes so turning next to our second key driver credit and provision on slides through as you flip through these slides there are a few key points id like you to take away we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables writeoff dollars excluding gcp down and yearoveryear respectively as you can see on slide we attribute this performance to our robust risk management practices the premium nature of our customer base as well as the unprecedented level of government stimulus and forbearance programs clearly macroeconomic forecasts have improved over the last days as you can see on slide however we still have two very different macroeconomic forecast scenarios and we continued to put significant weight on the downside scenario in the modeling we did to calculate our first quarter credit reserves the impact of the improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models coupled with the sequential decline in loan and receivables balances and our strong credit performance led us to release billion of american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 reserves this reserve release and our extremely low writeoffs drove a provision expense benefit of million in the first quarter as shown on slide that said the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still billion higher than they were pre pandemic as you can see on slide in the coming quarters we will see how the card members exiting our financial relief programs will perform that will be an important milestone for us though i would observe that all of the early exit performance indicators have looked quite strong there also continues to be some uncertainty in the medical environment and the vaccine rollout and well have to see how that plays out and so we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves slide shows you this in that we ended the first quarter with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively moving on to our third key driver marketing investments to rebuild growth momentum on slide we invested billion in marketing in the first quarter as we continued to rampup new card acquisitions while maintaining our valueinjection efforts we acquired million new cards in the first quarter up around sequentially importantly the number of new accounts we acquired on our premium feebased products was up versus q4 with acquisition volumes on many of our premium us consumer and small business products exceeding levels as steve mentioned in our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so as a result we continue to expect to spend a little over billion in marketing this full year our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as our customers begin again to experience the full benefits of our existing value propositions so what do our three key drivers mean for our financial performance this quarter as i said earlier yearover year revenues on slides and are impacted by the prioryear quarter including two prepandemic months so first quarter revenues were down yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis primarily driven by volume declines impacting net discount revenue and net interest income as well as declines in travelrelated revenues and delinquencies impacting other commissions and fees and other revenues net card fees however grew yearoveryear in the first quarter as you can see on slide demonstrating the impact of the strong continued card member engagement that steve discussed looking forward i expect the growth rate of net card fees will slow for a few more quarters driven by our decision last year to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during the beginning of the pandemic given the renewed momentum we are now beginning to see in new card acquisitions i would expect net card fee growth to then reaccelerate moving on to net interest income on slide you see that net interest income declined yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis while the primary driver of this is the decline in loan volumes net interest yield on our card member loans also decreased basis points due to the higher paydown rates from revolving card members on our credit card products looking forward i expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes volumes are also the primary driver of the discount revenue trends you see on slide as expected though the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business the average discount rate declined basis points yearoveryear driven by the greater declines we saw in te spending where we on average earn higher discount rates the yearoveryear erosion in the first quarter is a bit less than in q4 due to the recovery in te spending throughout the quarter that i spoke about earlier looking forward we still expect that if te spending recovers to around of levels by q4 as i mentioned previously youd probably see overall revenue growth of around to for full year and if te recovers more slowly or quickly you could see full year revenue growth thats somewhat lower or higher than that or american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 moving on to expenses we are continuing to break out on slide our variable customer engagement expenses which moved naturally inline with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and opex which are driven by management decisions variable customer engagement expenses in total were down yearoveryear relative to the past few quarters we did experience higher usage of travelrelated benefits and rewards which we see as a clear sign of the pentup demand weve been talking about looking forward a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that id expect them to be about of our total revenues for the next few quarters moving on to operating expenses you can see that they were down yearoveryear in the first quarter primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our amex ventures equity investment portfolio partially offset by some higher deferred and other compensation expenses in we still expect our operating expenses to be around billion below levels as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum turning next to capital and liquidity on slide our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong our cet1 ratio increased to in the first quarter our highest level since we began reporting this ratio and our cash and investment balance ended the quarter at billion far above our target levels driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter repurchasing million shares and we remain committed to our dividend distribution and to our longterm cet1 target ratio of to in q2 we plan to repurchase shares up to the maximum amount permitted under the fed authorized capacity of around million looking forward our capital distributions will be a function of the feds guidelines our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet so lets close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in q1 might mean for the future in january i laid out two scenarios of potential outcomes for that were primarily based on what happens with credit reserves our original scenario or low scenario assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year and that we would not release any credit reserves in the year now three months into the year the macro outlook has improved and credit performance has remained very strong so weve already released billion of reserves this still leaves us however with a lot of credit reserves weve built due to economic uncertainty so our updated scenario on slide assumes that this uncertainty persists that the medical and economic environment does not improve further and that we therefore do not release any additional credit reserves this year such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a te recovery by q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery the combination of these things could lead to an eps outcome as low as around per share our updated scenario in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook leading to less uncertainty and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves this sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery inline with the to revenue growth assumption i spoke about earlier in this scenario our eps could be as high as more importantly in either scenario as i said earlier our marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see not by a focus on any specific eps outcome for what we are focused on is managing the company to rebuild growth momentum and achieving our aspiration of being back to the original eps expectations that we had for in and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm beyond and with that ill turn the call back over to vivian american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express credit corp thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions alan question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc in march versus stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey don could you start again we missed the beginning donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc sure no problem so jeff if you look at your te down about versus in march and april sounds like it gained a lot of momentum it looks like down for q4 would be pretty conservative how are you thinking about that and also what are your te assumptions as you sort of look at your aspirational guide jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co well maybe ill start and then steve you might want to add a few comments so let me work backwards so in were really assuming don that consumer travel and entertainment spending is mostly back to where it was prepandemic small business lagging that a bit and then large and global corporation travel still being well below its levels the other comment i would make about is domestic travel in the us and around the globe will be the fuel that gets us to that level we would still expect crossborder travel to be a little weaker next year than it was in just given the likely lingering number of crossborder restrictions that youve seen as of how we feel about our q4 assumption look we had a clear inflection point this quarter in the us and so we feel good but steve you may want to add a few comments stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah no i think that the assumptions that jeff just went through are exactly the assumptions we have in our calculus here but i think when you look at this quarter and you look at the trends that were seeing i mean were seeing an increase in bookings right so were seeing our travel bookings are up over the this quarter up american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 over q4 when you look at and we look at this really carefully when you look at february versus march in march now we were of bookings and that was so we were in february and then went to so we feel really good about that when we also start to really dig into the data we start to look at sort of cohorts of spending and were seeing people that are younger are getting back at a much higher level their overall te spending is probably about to and almost back to where they were in in restaurants and then when we look at older people as they get vaccinated were seeing sequential growth monthonmonth as we look at their growth and so if you look at just people over youre seeing an increase in their overall te spending monthto month thats only going to get better for us as we move along and the last thing that gives us a lot of great hope is is redemptions is mr redemptions i mean when you go back and look at sort of mr redemptions that we had our mr point redemptions in the fourth quarter for air was like and thats up to so were doing some good things here and our customers are doing some good things and well continue to make sure that were retaining these customers because theyre going to spend and as jeff said our cobrand cards are doing quite well as well so all of that leads to again in an environment that continues to improve us having a lot of confidence in hitting our plan in donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator well go next to the line of one moment please well go next to the line of craig maurer go ahead please craig maurer q analyst autonomous yeah hi good morning thanks jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co good morning craig craig maurer q analyst autonomous hope everybodys well wanted to just ask about the guide a little bit for versus your original scenarios that you laid out with fourth quarter earnings how much higher was the reserve release than you had envisioned im trying to understand how much pullforward of reserve release benefit might have happened in the first quarter because of how strong credit quality was and the fact that lending did not accelerate jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co yeah so i think craig the first comment i would make is remember were not trying to provide guidance this year we tried to give people a couple of low and high scenarios back in january to help people think about the american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 year and we updated them this quarter what we are incredibly focused on is that aspiration which we are really growing in confidence about all that said if i take you back to january the then low scenario assumed that the world would be so tough this year that you would not end up releasing any credit reserves so we just released billion of reserves thats about that takes you from to so your assumes once again the world from here is suddenly going to get really tough and youre not going to release any more reserves at the high end yes we had assumed you release some modest level of reserves which is why the high end only went up from to so thats how we thought about it i just want to close though by again emphasizing were not focused on any particular eps outcome this year were incredibly focused on what were trying to achieve for operator well go next to the line of mark devries with barclays go ahead please mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks i think that guidance around the corporate te spend makes a lot of sense but steve id be interested in getting your color on recent conversations youre having with your large corporates on when they think theyll feel comfortable having their employees travel more freely whether theyll recover to prepandemic levels how much substitution of virtual occurs and then finally just given that do you see more upside or kind of downside to that recovery level stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co all right so when you think about corporate the first thing people have to do is get back into the offices right because if people arent back into the offices theres nowhere to travel to and youre starting to see look i mean jeff and i are in here today with of our closest friends in a building that has about people and weve said were not going to have people really come back until after labor day youre seeing other companies sort of gradually get back into it so i think theres step first step is lets get people back into the office and then companies are going to say okay how comfortable i am having visitors into the building and my anticipation is most companies will start the process of reopening in the united states now july through sort of september and get to some capacity level and i mean you guys have your own situations yourselves where most of you are probably sitting at home today so i think whats going to happen is its going to be slow which is why we really havent assumed a lot of corporate te coming back and a lot of travel coming back having said that corporate te takes many forms we do have salespeople that are out and on the road and calling on accounts and theres car rental and theres gas and theyre still staying at hotels and restaurants and so i think for a segment of it and i think when you look at a segment of our lets call them industrial corporate te corporate customers they have people that are going to plants and visiting making customer calls and so forth i think that eventually whatll happen is investment banks and consultants are going to want to go out and meet with their clients again theres been a lot of deals that have been done a lot of relationships that have been built but theres nothing like inperson i just think itll take a bit of time and look theres also that substitution its the substitution of webex and zoom and what have you which is why weve been talking before it gets back to levels and i think with that assumption we feel good about hitting that aspiration in so when american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 you think about what goes into our assumption for youve got a slower return of international youve got a much lower return of corporate and yet were saying well be at levels and so is there upside from a consumer perspective on travel i think that all depends on the rollout of the vaccine governments opening up their borders and things like that i think from a domestic travel perspective theres pentup demand in talking to ed bastian in talking to chris nassetta theyre seeing a lot of bookings out front i just went through some of our travel data so as we go through this i think whats going to be the key thing to watch for is how much does international travel come back from a consumer and were assuming that sort of now in the second half of okay not really this year and i think the other thing youre seeing mark is youre seeing a divergence i mean you see whats going on in india right now theres a lot of countries that are having different results and different situations as it relates to the vaccine but one thing is inarguable the more vaccine rollout the more people feel confident the more people feel confident the more theyll get out and spend and thats why i think when you look at sort of the towards the end of this second quarter into third quarter in the summer youre going to see people hitting the roads youre going to see people hitting the skies especially in the us operator well go next to the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley go ahead please betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hi betsy stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so my question is on the million accounts acquired in the quarter maybe you could give us some color on the type of customer age bracket income geography that kind of thing and give us a sense of whats resonating is it more the cash back the te the specific enhancements that youre making on some of the programs spend more get more kind of points bonus points and a little bit on how youre thinking about this group of new accounts that youre acquiring and what that means for future spend trajectory and growth rates versus maybe what you were acquiring prepandemic if theres any comparecontrast there you can share that would be great thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co okay well let me give you its probably a half hour meeting there but let me go through so look million new cards normally you saw us average about million new cards when you look at the consumer cards of the cards we acquired were millennial or gen z we saw in the pandemic you saw more cash american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 back cards being acquired there was a jump in premium cards that we saw in this particular quarter and acquisition of platinum and gold cards was wellabove prepandemic levels so we feel good about that and just to give you some sort of contrast on that when you look at our feebased products its still a little bit lower i mean were acquiring about it was about in but sequential increases have helped were seeing cobrand cards come back i mean we talked about more delta cards acquired in this quarter than in the previous quarter and were seeing a higherlevel customer i mentioned that in my remarks the fico is a lot higher and were seeing good spending so we feel good about both our small business and consumer we dont really talk about geographic distribution and things like that but our intent is not only to acquire cards but we also when we talk about it we acquire billed business and were on track to do from a billed business acquired perspective where we were in so we feel good about that jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co the only thing id add just to make it clear betsy is that the sequential growth in the travel cobrands has been tremendous theyre still below where they were prepandemic because you still dont have anywhere near as many people staying at hotels or sitting on airplanes and so thats what leaves us overall a little bit below the level of prepandemic new card acquisitions but were quite confident that will come back and once you look beyond that sector we think were at great levels today operator well go next to the line of mihir bhatia with bank of america go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking the question i wanted to ask dig a little bit more on the by year end te assumption is there it sounds like theres a mix shift between volumes there too between domestic and international weighted more towards domestic which i think we all understand but maybe is there a difference in revenue or profitability between that travel in terms of what you make so i guess what im trying to ask is as te comes back is the contribution to revenue maybe going to lag a little bit compared to the contribution to volume just from that mix shift and then any update on april billing trends thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah no so when we report the volume its the volume and theres no different obviously if people are booking first class international tickets to hong kong they cost a lot more than first class tickets to indianapolis but the reality is were giving you volume numbers so it just means you need a lot more of those tickets to indianapolis than you do to hong kong so no there isnt there isnt a difference for us were not giving you sort of when we talk about volumes were not giving you number of trips booked here what were doing is were giving you actual volumes so we may have actually more trips in fact when we look at we look at this we look at receipt of charges and transactions basically so we may have more transactions in air and you may have lower dollar but that doesnt mean anything to our margins jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co the only thing id add mihir is when you look at our other revenue and other fee and commission lines there is some dollars in there that do come crossborder travel and as we think about the aspiration we dont actually expect that to be fully back to levels in we dont need it to be to hit our aspirations id american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 actually put that in the category of things steve talked about earlier that even beyond theres still probably a couple remaining tailwinds as the last of crossborder travel and corporate travel begin to come back to levels post2022 operator well go next to the line of meng jiao with deutsche bank go ahead please meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey thanks for taking my question i wanted to touch on the recent expansion of pay it plan it to all us consumer cards have you seen any sort of usage acceleration since you expanded that and then can you actually frame for us how big the opportunity set can be and it could apply to that aspiration that you mentioned thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah no so its really too early to sort of tell on just how much weve got because we really just did it but its not really in its not in our calculus to help us make our number its totally upside for us but again just to put it in perspective youre talking about million plans from inception youre talking about billion of overall ar and its a convenience feature that we have yeah id like to say it was our answer to buy now pay later except we had it before a lot of the buy now pay laters we just had it on particular cards and now we put it on all the cards so it really is all about meeting overall card members cash flow needs and theyll do this versus potentially revolve on charge or just a normal lending transaction it gives them more certainty so its in the overall numbers that we have and the overall spending that we have but i wouldnt say in any way shape or form its a big driver of operator well go next to the line of bill carcache with wolfe research one moment your line is open sir go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning steve and jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning bill jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hey bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc so you guys have done a very effective job of adjusting your prepandemic value propositions but can you offer any thoughts on the work youve done more recently around potential postpandemic changes and consumer preferences that may be longer lasting and the risk that that could lead to more permanent changes for example how concerned are you guys about the risk that the value proposition associated with airline lounges american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 may not be as great postcovid and how confident are you that youll be able to identify sustainable cost effective alternatives to maintain the overall value proposition across your different products to the extent that we cant just go back to the old sort of the older prepandemic offerings that you guys had stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so couple points so look our strategy for the last three years has been to refresh our products on an ongoing basis ongoing basis anywhere from sort of three to four years and so well talk more as we refresh those products and well give you a little bit more color on that i take the opposite view on sort of the travel value propositions i think theyre actually going to be even stronger at this point i think that people are going to want to have the safety and security of our lounges were opening up more lounges were not backing away from these lounges in fact weve opened up numerous lounges during the pandemic and theyve turned into a little bit more of an oasis to people where they know with our brand our security and our reputation were going to take as good care of people in our lounges as possible and i think the other thing that theres a lot of questions we got at this time last year was whats the future of your travel cobrand cards and when we look at the month of march and we look at sort of delta and we look at hilton as just two examples theyre at spending levels overall and because people have been accumulating points and people want status and as ive said numerous times on these calls status is probably even going to be even more important going forward so what we will continue to do is were not going to walk away from our travel value propositions if anything ive been more encouraged that we did the right things and well continue to add though i mean i think if you look at our history over the last three years or so three and a half years weve kept our core value proposition and continued to add and during the pandemic i talked about the results we had with wireless and the results we had with streaming we got customers who were not using our card for those things by putting some value in were now four months after the value and theyre still spending and were doing the same thing right now weve got a paypal credit for our platinum cardholders and were picking up more card members that didnt use paypal and as ive talked about paypal and ive talked about some of the other fintech square and stripe and so forth theyve actually not only helped us get more coverage but have helped us in ways to deliver more value to our card members so we feel good about our value propositions we feel good about the travel value propositions that are in our products but we will continue to expand and evolve our value propositions as we have over time were not walking away from that strategy operator well go next to ryan nash with goldman sachs go ahead please ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey ryan american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so steve maybe as a followup on that so you injected significant value prop enhancements into the business like streaming and wireless as you just referenced and i believe some of those will evolve over the next few quarters so can you maybe just talk about how you envision repurposing those marketing dollars i think jeff you talked about spending a little over billion this year could we see that come down beyond this year or do you expect to see these enhancements shifted towards customer acquisition and maybe we could see customer acquisitions above that those million per quarter that you talked about in thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so a couple of points we spent i think it was like billion this quarter some of that was in value injection not the wireless and streaming those have ended this is different types of value injection but the majority of that was customer acquisition and customer engagement when we look at the rest of the year i think we said were going to spend billion but well spend up to the attractive opportunities that are there if there are not attractive opportunities we will not spend it if there are attractive opportunities we will spend more if theyre there because were focused on building that momentum having said that given that you have sort of probably a sixmonth value injection window and youve got customer acquisition and customer retention more than likely you will see that overall dollar bucket come down next year as we go into when youre not doing that value injection jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co the only thing id add ryan is weve talked about the fact that as you go through this year to steves point you need to see the value injection spending come down and we were pleased this quarter because actually it was down sequentially and we still continue to see tremendous customer attrition and retention rates probably because the traveloriented value parts of our value propositions are becoming more valuable to people again operator well go next to the line of jamie friedman with susquehanna research go ahead please james e friedman q analyst susquehanna financial group lllp this is a very thoughtful ir deck so thank you for that and for the updated commentary i just wanted to ask in slides and you demonstrate the outperformance of sme you dont have to go to the slides im just anchoring it but in terms of the outperformance of sme steve and jeff could you remind us what it is about that relative to large and corporate that is different that makes it more sustainable thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 yeah so you probably heard us shuffling the pages to get to and but yeah so theres a huge difference i mean so our corporate card is predominantly its like travel and entertainment whereas our sme card is like goods and services they use the card to run their business and as weve talked about travel coming back it comes back in layers it comes back with consumer then its sme and then its large and corporate so it is a very different business which is why we went and acquired kabbage to have a digital front for these smes where they can not only get their card spending done but also get working capital loans have a transaction banking account have merchant financing loan have shortterm loans and things like that because small businesses small and midsize businesses use this card to really help to run their businesses which is a fundamental difference between how corporations use the card which is to support te and obviously theres b2b opportunities with large corporates but thats why small businesses has come back why our small businesses have done i think even better than what you might have thought is is the dispersion that we have across the small business arena and ive said this many times when people think about small businesses they tend to think about the small retail shop or they tend to think about the small restaurant the reality is a lot of them didnt do so well during this time we dont have a tremendous amount of our small business base there it is a very diverse base and when you think about professional services you think about cooling and plumbing and electric and all those things our base is very wide and that has helped us because some small business segments during this time have just been through the roof others have been hit really hard and others have businesses have maintained as they were before the pandemic operator well go now to the line of bob napoli with william blair go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you good morning steve stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey bob jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hey bob robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc a question on china i guess and in debit as broader thoughts on debit so what should we see out of china youve changed your reporting somewhat because you expect to see some significant numbers i guess out of china but you also talked about building debit capability broader than china and i just wondered what your long term thoughts were on that stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so i think we changed that to provide i think the appropriate level of transparency for you guys because obviously as weve said this all along gs volumes are not worth the same to us as gs as proprietary volumes and china volumes are part of that mix and so thats why we change it to processed volumes american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 because yes youre right over time we do expect that volume to be very significant and we wanted to make sure we were providing the right level of insight so that you guys could make the right assumptions and there will be in china itll be charge credit and itll be debit cards and so as we build that capability we will evaluate where else if you build that capability for your network it gives you the capability to do it in other markets and so well evaluate over time where that makes sense for us to roll that out so nothing really to announce here but i think its important that you understand the capabilities that were building as well and were building these capabilities from a global perspective so that we have it but to also point out we do have gs partners in local markets today that have debit products have american express debit products they just tend to get used more locally within country as opposed to around the world and its important at some point we will have a lot of traveling chinese card members and its important that theyre able to use all the products that our partners issued to them all around the world and debit being one of them operator well go next to the line of rick shane with jpmorgan go ahead please richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks so much for taking my question i know you guys have been on here a while one of the consequences of the card act was that it shifted the competitive landscape from offering lower rates to higher rewards and we think at the peak of the gfc recovery that was particularly challenging for axp because it had the impact of basically causing industry offers to converge to your core value propositions one of the responses we saw from you is that you moved them to your front foot in terms of targeting millennials for card acquisition im curious as we sort of enter this new period of expansion and all of your competitors are talking about growth what are the lessons youve learned last cycle and either tactically or strategically how will you respond stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i have a different version of the card act than you do i think our competitors got into this more after the financial crisis when they really looked at this and said this was a very attractive business the reality is the card act had a lot less impact on us because remember of our revenues are not from interest and the fact that interest rates especially on prior balances were now controlled really had less impact on us than it did on our competitors our competitors wound up just growing their overall business and one of the first things they did is hire a lot of people from american express to do that but look i think that the lessons that weve learned over time and look ive always said this we welcome competition the lessons that we learned over time is you need to continue to focus in on what your customer needs are and how your customer is changing and evolving and this is why when i took over one of the first things i said is were going to go to a strategy of refreshing our products on a real ongoing basis you cannot have your green card sit out there for years and think its still as relevant years ago as it is today millennials was really not as much a card act millennials was us opening our eyes to the fact that our value proposition had a much broader appeal and i think that we really started to communicate that and look and ive said this publicly before i think your company there did a great job of really highlighting premium cards im talking about jpmorgan and gordon and his team did a fantastic job of highlighting premium cards to millennials and our value proposition played remarkably well there and as i just said of our cards that we just acquired are millennials american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 i think we had to expand our aperture and we did that we expanded that aperture and we realized that the value proposition that we had could have a wider audience and could have a wider target and weve done that and we will continue to do that you will continue to see that from a multicultural perspective you will continue to see that from millennials youll continue to see that with women as well so i think what we learned is that since then is that there is a broader market for our products than we initially thought number one number two you always have to keep innovating and you have to innovate on a regular cycle basis you cant stand on your laurels and i would say that we learned more from some of our trials and tribulations with costco than we did from the card act operator our final question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw go ahead please sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co good morning sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc most of my questions have been asked but just a quick one on credit jeff i think you mentioned youre still weighting towards the negative or a higher weighting towards the negative scenario in your reserve calculation im just curious sort of how realistic that is given sort of where we are and were looking at delinquency rates here and the building momentum maybe you could just talk about that and then just one quick one on the expenses you mentioned the venture gains helping expenses this quarter i mean should we just view it as a onetime gain or how should we think about that was that spent thanks jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co so on credit sanjay youre correct for the purposes of our accounting credit reserve we did significantly weight a downside scenario and i think thats in keeping with a little bit of a regulatory view where you have the federal reserve saying to all banks were still little want to see a little bit more time pass before we free everyone to go back to returning to your appropriate capital levels so we thought it was appropriate to be that conservative but to be clear the reserve that we have on the books implies that some that steady recovery that were in the midst of now just stops and things get worse so if it doesnt then you would expect to see more reserves the only other comment id make is its april youre already at the point of the year where you really cant for the most part see writeoffs go up significantly this year even if bad stuff happens the actual writeoffs would go into next year on opex yes we did have a million gain on the really great portfolio we have of fintech investments we have about different companies we have holdings in we do partnerships with those companies its really all about those partnerships but markets been pretty frothy lately so there was a big gain on a couple of those companies this quarter theres also some offsets when the equity markets are frothy our deferred comp balances are a bit of an offset or a hedge almost to the equity investments i would really think of it sanjay mostly as a onetime sort of thing this year the reality is were not focused on any particular eps outcome what were focused on is to the extent we have good investment opportunities you will see us use the financial american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 strength we have right now to pursue those opportunities because we are laser focused and increasingly confident of
