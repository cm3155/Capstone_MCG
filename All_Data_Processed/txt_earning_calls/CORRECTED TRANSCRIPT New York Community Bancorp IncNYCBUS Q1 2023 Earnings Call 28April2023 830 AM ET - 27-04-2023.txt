york community bancorp inc thank you sal good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today today i would like to cover a few topics with you our first quarter operating results the first as a combined company with flagstar how we fared during the recent market upheaval the signature bank transaction and finally provide you with some forwardlooking guidance as you all know the first quarter was a volatile quarter for the banking industry and unfortunately several good financial institutions became victims of this volatility while no financial institution is immune from the damage that the crisis in confidence causes the new york community fared very well during this period of turmoil due to our diversified business model focusing on several core businesses retail banking commercial lending multifamily and commercial real estate lending and the residential mortgage origination and servicing business we do not have any exposure to cryptocurrency or stablecoin related industries nor do we have significant relationships with financial technology companies moreover during this time our percentage of uninsured deposits was amongst the lowest in the industry not only did we successfully navigate the market turmoil but we emerge from this in a stronger position when on march 20th we announced that our bank subsidiary flagstar bank na purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of signature bridge bank new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 this transaction is a game changer for us strategically it builds upon the momentum created by our recent merger with flagstar and accelerates our transformation to a high performing commercial bank and improves our deposit base and our overall funding profile while providing further loan diversification in addition we jumpstart our commercial middle market lending business and our relationship banking strategy the transaction included several other businesses that were part of our longer term build out strategy including the broker dealer and wealth management business and several new attractive lending vertical such as healthcare and sba lending importantly we also returned retain virtually all of signatures highly productive private client banking teams predominately based in the new york region along with those teams related to the recent west coast expansion primarily based in california everyone here at new york community is extremely pleased to have them and the other channels in place with signature bank join our team and we look forward to us doing great things together lastly the transaction is anticipated to be financially attractive with expected eps accretion of more than whilst also significantly and immediately accretive to tangible book value per share at closing tangible book value per share jumped to a share at the end of the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year given our earnings power from this transaction we expect tangible book value generation to accelerate turning now to our results first quarter results on a gaap basis were impacted by several items arising from the signature transaction and the flagstar acquisition including an approximate billion volume purchase gain mergerrelated expenses of million and initial provision for credit loss of million for the loans acquired from signature adjusted first quarter diluted earnings per share were a share slightly ahead of consensus estimates for the quarter net income available to common stockholders as adjusted increased to million compared to the fourth quarter of last year operating results were driven by a full quarters benefit from the flagstar acquisition which closed on december 1st of last year approximately two weeks of signatures operations strong organic loan growth in the legacy franchise and a much higher net interest margin one of the many benefits from the flagstar acquisition is the impact of our net interest margin from adding its mostly variable rate loan portfolio and its lowcost deposit base we saw some of this benefit in the fourth quarter but it was more pronounced this quarter as the net interest margin was up basis points compared to the fourth quarter of we believe that margin expansion will continue throughout the year with additional expansion opportunities from the signature transaction turning to our loan portfolio excluding loans acquired from the signature transaction of approximately billion total loans and leases increased billion during the current first quarter up about on a linkedquarter basis about billion of this growth was in the ci portfolio particularly in specialty finance and the mortgage warehouse businesses new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 the loan portfolio continues to become more diversified as we continue our evolution to a commercial bank model commercial loans at march 31st represented of total loans compared to at december 31st while multifamily loans stood at of total loans compared to as for the quality of our loan portfolio both our asset quality and metrics and trends remain strong total non performing assets of million are up only modestly on a linkedquarterly basis and represents a low basis points of total assets the allowance and credit losses increased to million or from the yearend to million and the coverage improves to of nonperforming loans or nearly times importantly we reported another quarter of low or no loan losses and net chargeoffs was zero during the current first quarter compared to million during the previous quarter our office exposure remains very manageable and we remain comfortable with the credit trends in this sector our office exposure at quarter end was billion or approximately of total loans we provided some details in our investor presentation but to summarize the average loan side is million with a weighted average coupon of the weighted average ltv is and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio is times furthermore we have no delinquencies and no charges in this portfolio as you can see these metrics are proof positive that our conservative underwriting standards have served us well over numerous credit cycles this along with a high quality balance sheet should serve us well in the event of an economic downturn regardless we will continue to be laser focused on credit quality across all the new verticals especially those that we have recently entered on the deposit front our deposits totaled billion at march 31st the signature transaction after experiencing initial expected outflows contributed billion of deposits as of quarterend legacy flagstar nycb deposit declined billion due to anticipate spend down in the prepaid debit card program and the reserve account withdrawal from circle all told these two categories accounted for over of the decline in legacy deposit balances remaining were mostly institutional deposits in terms of liquidity while we have always had ample sources of liquidity our liquidity position was enhanced by the billion in cash from the signature transaction currently our available liquidity from cash unpledged securities and the bond to cash both the fhlb of new york and the fed is over billion at the same time our uninsured deposits excluding collateralized deposits totaled billion or of total deposits accordingly our ready liquidity represents of uninsured deposits in addition to our diversified business mix we have a conservative and highquality availableforsale securities portfolio consisting primarily of gserelated securities approximately onethird of these securities were markto market in conjunction with the flagstar acquisition accordingly the amount of aoci is amongst the lowest in the industry and has minimal impact on capital also as part of our longterm liquidity planning strategy we do not have any securities designated held to maturity in terms of our expenses total opex were million up million compared to million in the fourth quarter our first quarter expense base includes a full quarter of flagstar expenses compared to only one month during the fourth quarter and days of signature as for guidance given the current outlook we expect first quarter nim to expand from first quarter levels to a range of to first quarter gain on sale on mortgage loans of million to million and a full year tax rate of approximately new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 weve accomplished quite a lot in a relatively short period of time we will devote the rest of this year to integrating and converting signature and flagstar reducing our expenses growing our deposits further and building out each of our businesses as we evolve to become the new flagstar lastly id like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and support over the past few months especially the last few months none of what we have accomplished so far wouldnt be possible without them with that well be happy to answer any questions you may have well do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you sir ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you good morning tom so i guess maybe first question just around deposits the slide that you have the waterfall two things one give us a sense of whats underlying your assumption i think i heard you say you expect margin expansion not just in the second quarter but toward the year so whats underpinning that in terms of deposits one around legacy flagstar do you expect more runoffs similar to what you saw i think in the early part of the year the billion how much more do you see leaving the bank there and then on the signature deposits i think theyve held up much better than i would have thought so give us a sense of what you expect around the signature deposit base thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so ill start off ebrahim then ill pass it over to john and reggie regarding the deposit base but i would tell you given the timing of the transaction and the speed of execution now we modeled approximately the runoff because given the circumstances of the turmoil going on in march we felt that that was a conservative number we actually came in less than most important about that structure im going to into april piece and look at whats the activity has been the dda activity has been its been a rock its been solid its been actually up slightly throughout april and if you think about where we were a year ago as a as nycb standalone that was a billion dda balance that went to approximately billion of the flagstar transaction now were billion of dda or of deposit so if you think about how that impacts the margin those costs are zero so thats a very powerful position to be in when we looked at the historical franchise where were more focused on higher costtype liabilities so were very pleased on the stability of the dda accounts as far as the stability overall were seeing new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 a relatively flat position right now we expected some runoff the first days following the announcement and its been very manageable with that ill pass the baton over to john and then after john hell pass it to reggie to talk about what were seeing throughout the whole organization john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and just quickly if you when were talking about the margin guide one of the items to keep in mind too is on the borrowing side so we have billion of a wholesale funding that is coming due or we expect to be put back to us in the second quarter and thats at a rate so were going to get some margin benefit there by just paying that down in the quarter we also have some brokerage cd runoff at pretty high rates as well so with the stability of the noninterest bearing deposits that tom talked about and that reggie will talk to quickly on the retail side what were looking at thats coming due and paying down especially in the second quarter is higher rate wholesale borrowings and brokerage cds that were going to pay down with the excess cash that we have on the balance sheet reggie anything you want to add on the deposit side reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc yeah i would just say i think the first quarter was actually a validation of just how stable our retail and core wholesale book are if you kind of look point to point december were only down on a combined basis across nycb and flagstar so thats like less than billion on a billion book so i would i consider that a win and some of that quite frankly was kind of natural surge runoff and kind of what we see in the portfolio on a run rate basis so i think the portfolio performed extremely well and would continue to perform this year the same in the same way thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so ebrahim just a comment on that again just to reiterate and going to the margin if you think about the cash position and were sitting on an abundance of liquidity and what the funding cost was that weve acquired to the deposit side on signature netnet i think a carry which is above our current margin thats sort of sitting in cash and just managing the cash flow as john indicated paying off higher cost of debt as we go forward that is ultimately the strategy to have a much better funded balance sheet going forward here and more commercial banklike deposits so the benefit of just sitting in cash right now is actually contributing to higher margin but as we deploy it into other businesses and higher yields and more importantly we focus on paying down some of the highcost wholesale liabilities to be more traditional funded that will continue to see some good margin benefits throughout the full year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just a second question tom talk to us around the alignment and integration means obviously you had to flex that integration going on with signature and youve kept a senior executive from new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 signature including eric on board give us a sense of how that integration is proceeding what should we be watching in terms of the success of like keeping those teams on board and then what does that mean for just growth outlook going forward thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so great question ebrahim so obviously day one we hit the ground running both eric and i have spent you know significant energy on ensuring that we have the transition for the teams were very confident and very happy on the result of that as indicated in my prepared remarks we preserved the teams both on the east coast and the west coast and also the business lines all the lines of businesses are in place and were very pleased on bringing them on board and when you think about the next step here which is culture culture culture we have to integrate these companies culturally and its going to be a substantial amount of energy but we are super excited about the signature folks coming on board we know them well we know that we know our competition so were clearly working together and when it comes to systems the flagstar transaction is still scheduled for the first quarter of and well go into a deep dive right now in assessing whats best for the bank and more importantly how the customers are going to be served so its also its all going to be about customer service as we truly take on a relationship banking model so the most important aspect of that as we make these decisions that we integrate this at the appropriate timeframe to ensure theres no customer disruption mr pinto wants to add a little bit more on the integration side regarding signature versus flagstar john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah the most important thing weve been doing from our teams in operations it is just really making sure we understand the size and the scope of what the private client groups and the teams at signature are used to on the system side so our main focus is to ensure that we avoid any potential customer negativity minimize any customer impact so were going through that process now you know that process will not will not impact the actual date of the flagstar integration but it is something were working towards now to finalize a date on and just to ensure that we get the systems converted in the most efficient and effective way possible while minimizing customer impact thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead your line is now live new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning i want to go to the guidance slide if you could for a moment the expense guide the billion to billion which is presignature i understand theres a ton of moving in this parts and its still early but can you help us just on the expense contribution from signature thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so ill leave and im going to pass the baton back to john on the expense side obviously its early days if you look back what they were running they were running around million mid800 million run rate on the previous year remember we didnt take all the businesses and there are a lot of transactional benefits we have as we restructure the transaction so were running at to and we reiterated that guide on a standalone basis but as we put on the signature teams and a lot of it now obviously the actual private client groups theyre going to remain intact so thats a lot of expense that we are forecasting within our run rate but if you start with the mid and then get a similar transaction the nature of the transaction like this since its not a traditional ma deal and indiscernible receivership transaction we tend to believe theres much more savings given the type of transaction so historically weve always been between to range you probably will get the higher end of the range given the nature of the transaction over time which then you can probably formulate a run rate as we integrate these companies i think thats a reasonable way to look at the combined company and anything mr pinto wants to add as the cfo as well what youre thinking here john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think you know what tom said it makes a lot of sense and its what were working towards right now which is we know what our run rate is going to be we do believe that in the next couple of quarters our expenses will be elevated as we continue to go through the process of integration understanding exactly what we have and the processes were going to use to do it and especially until we get the systems converted what we do believe though is that we if you look back of course at our track record we believe weve been very very consistent in how weve managed noninterest expense its been extremely important to us we have a lot of history around effectively managing that in multiple different cycles and even with the integrations and acquisitions that weve had in the past so were really confident in our ability to do that over time but we do believe that in the shortterm expenses will be a little bit higher here as we go through this process and then once we get our systems converted well be able to have a run rate that gets into the levels that tom just mentioned right so and the other thing just to bring up quickly on our last call we talked about trying to front run some of the cost saves from the flagstar transaction into that process was ongoing given of course the signature transaction thatll take a little bit of a step back so thats why youll see just a little bit more expenses in the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 quarter than we anticipated and then from a run rate perspective we believe well be able to manage to a really solid run rate combined once we get through our systems integration reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc yeah so chris i would also add just be mindful in the first quarter at the beginning of the year we did a substantial mortgage banking repositioning for the franchise to position ourselves regardless of interest rates on the mortgage space and lease on the lease its execution that was put in place i think it was latejanuary into februaryish so we dont have the full benefit of that going forward so we feel over each quarter as we put on signature and as we get to the benefits of the full mortgage repositioning youll see ongoing favorable adjustments as we walk as we work through the integration phase of towards the end of the year with signature clearly well see each quarter more steps made towards putting the franchises together maybe lee smith you want to talk a little bit about on the mortgage side what weve accomplished with that lee lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah no thanks tom so yeah i think we mentioned on the last call that we executed on a big restructuring on the mortgage business we let ftes go as we rightsize the distributed retail business so that were just an inbranch footprint model but when i say inbranch footprint that is a combination of both the flagstar and new york community bank branches so its a bigger geography and we did it because we want to be profitable on the origination side even in this tough mortgage market but were still one of the biggest bank originators of mortgages originating in all six channels we hold a considerable msr asset which generates strong returns weve got the servicing and subservicing business that closed off a lot of fee income were the second largest warehouse lender we do msr lending servicing advanced lending and were working on more aggressive deposit gathering from the mortgage ecosystem so whether you we do b2b b2c on the mortgage side whether youre the biggest bond in the industry or whether youre an individual borrower you can come to flagstar well take care of you we look at it as the one stop shop and were able to generate stronger earnings through the whole food chain of the of the mortgage ecosystem christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks thank you for all of that my followup just want to make sure i understand john so if im starting mid for legacy expenses for signature and you said so that would get you low kind of a destination and then we would add and on top of that add the cdi that youve previously talked about is that is that the message we should be taking away john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no i think thats maybe a little bit aggressive its the high end of the range tom gave i think its probably a little bit lower than that but you know thats a thats a decent way to start to look at it new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc because i think its also the timing of it right its an happen face indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so we think about assuming q1 when the flagstar actual transaction is integrated were going to have significant benefits there on the tech side as well so were really looking at putting all these systems together and as we remember when we announced the conversion date you should get significant benefits on a standalone basis presignature on flagstar you know post the conversion date as well so when you come up with your estimated run rate i think that those are all fair assessments when were coming up with what you think the expense run rate christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and as we progress during the year well hopefully update our guidance as we dive deep into the signature franchise christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then on the one timer to come maybe a little help there and also the share count given the warrants i assume just the end of period is a good proxy thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah the end of period is a good proxy that 720ish range right thats a good proxy to use per share count going forward so thats where you need to be christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and remaining one timer just for book value purposes thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc listen we got to we do have a handful coming still from both the flagstar transaction in the short term we probably got another million to look at over the next couple of quarters new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc two quarters yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thanks a lot thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc great operator thank you your next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon from piper sandler please go ahead your line is now live mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co just to followup on your earlier questions i think tom that signature had something like teams do you have a sense for how many have stayed how many have stayed today thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah so mark great point so we didnt acquire the entire institution there were other teams that didnt come with the transaction so we estimate its about one 127ish i think were like now so i call that a huge success i think eric has worked hard alongside with me to make sure that we have the retention plans in place and were super excited about where we are there so we think about the teams that we were focusing on its about out of 127ish and we feel really good about that and the retention process has been very strong and more importantly the culture of getting this company together with a much larger balance sheet being able to do a lot more for the client is only enhanced so were excited about that mark and i would say its a huge success for us and its neverending right you have to make sure that as we work on culture the team understands that we do have other products other opportunities for the new customers from signature coming on board to really enhance the customer experience so eric and i had spent a lot of time on retention and we believe its been a success new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co and then secondly unrelated what does the pipeline of new business in banking as a service space look like today thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so look i think in general we are developing a lot of technology initiatives really trying to strategy focused on going out there and being within the middle of the pack and we have some good work to do over time and we see some good developments there just on an aside if you look at what signature has done historically on technology developments with the client its also been very innovative so collectively i think our opportunity is even more innovative now with the talent skills over at signature combined with our initiatives here on what were doing in banking as a service theres just some good wins along the way we have the government business is obviously a focus of ours and its been consistent and were looking forward to partner with our technology partners there and its been a very successful process for us and were looking at all opportunities that make sense for the bank going forward to tie into the customer needs so id say its been relatively strong we had the some runoffs that we expected during the turmoil in march but the dollar amount i think we see mortgage as a service and government as a service and banking as a service of what john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc a little lower thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so its still relatively strong number and were looking forward to hopefully new developments with the us treasury relationship as that gets on boarded were doing a lot around the digital side thats all in automation analysis trying to get that up and running where we go for what plastic to digital and thats the plan to work with the government on that so were excited about development but you know its a long churning market and i think the pick above the signature team is going to help that journey mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co last question i had for you is i wondered if you could share with us your thoughts on capital or whether you have a target there and also the dividend thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well obviously you know what capital builds is going to be significant as to tangible item in my prepared remarks i made it very clear that you know were talking about capital formation going forward which is a very good place to be new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 and you know this transaction is highly accretive both on the upfront tangible as well as the earnings per share going forward and our dividend coverage ratio just on for pro forma and analysis the ratio comes down substantially so were very pleased about where we end up on a projected basis where these indiscernible our dividend coverage ratio dramatically improving on a dividend side so obviously the dividend is strong and were very comfortable and going forward into these multiple transactions it becomes even more in our opinion much stronger that being said on capital we think that were in a very good position to generate a lot of capital as we go into the quarters ahead and thats kind of in my prepared remarks focusing on the tangible book value creation so john if you want to add john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and the other thing that we started looking at too is when you look at our common equity tier you know were in the you know we increased it a little bit in the quarter so it came in a little better than we anticipated weve run it that you know a or under were slightly under cet1 in the past were comfortable with those levels but those levels are going to start coming up and the other thing to keep in mind mark too is when you look at the unrealized loss on our securities portfolio and if you looked in a peer group analysis including unrealized losses on securities we were at the closer to the top of the list in cet1 and then the bottom of the list so theres a couple of different ways that we do look at capital you know our history from a loss perspective so we believe we can run that at these levels were cognizant of the facts though of where we are from a peer perspective and thats why this transaction we look so forward to because of the capital generation it provides lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah mark just one major point here when we put the transaction together working behind the scenes and getting this deal done with a regulatory constituents we were very clear that we wanted to solve for capital where there was no negative impact on capital as a result of the transaction and then the accretion benefit is substantial and thats how we kind of solve for and how we formulated our bidding process to be able to be successful to acquire the selected assets and liabilities and assume the liabilities that we focused on that was key in our capital we view as far as coming in to figure out how we can put this transaction together so were very excited about the capital build formation post transaction mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of brody preston from ubs please go ahead your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning brody new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone hey i just wanted to put a finer point on the expenses again i know its tough but you said the mid i think signature at the end of the year was running closer to like a million kind of run rate and i know you didnt bring over everything so i just wanted to clarify is it starting from a mid level john and then working its way down to to cost savings from there john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean the we mentioned was just the year right the annual expense so we just used that kind of as a kick off point for the piece but thats right we didnt take you know all of the businesses so you know we think the number from that perspective is just probably under a billion run rate on a combined basis so i think thats the easiest way to look at it we think thats pretty conservative and hopefully well be able to do a little bit better than that over time but we think thats really where this is going to shake out when you look at putting both companies together you know for the goforward period when we get the systems converted brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and i did want to follow up on just the legacy deposit base you know could you give us a sense i know theres a lot of moving parts between all the programs and then the seasonality from the custodial deposits and whatnot but i guess you know when you look at the legacy deposit base do you have any thoughts on you know what the seasonality will look like throughout the year and you know i guess what your growth targets are for deposits for the year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah let me ill just start that and then you know i can turn it over a little bit to reggie on the retail side but one item to keep in mind is the government as a service business you know those deposits which you know weve talked about on multiple calls which worked out for us because theyre noninterest bearing but they that runoff does continue on those deposits it is done you know slightly better than we originally anticipated but you know that runoff continues so that that well see a runoff in that noninterest bearing segment throughout the next couple of quarters that totals billion as of march 31st so well see some runoff there we really a lot of the banking as a service type stuff that we expected to runoff when the liquidity event happened when the liquidity event happened has run off so there are probably a handful of smaller items in that perspective where well see some slight runoff but theres nothing really besides the government deposits theres nothing really that we see from a materiality perspective that we expect to run down here reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc let me on boarded indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 well new program that were hoping new programs are coming from california by the end of the year maybe even the end of the third quarter so were hoping that starts to kick in but i was just looking at the runoff piece which we dont think itll be that material when were looking at bankingasaservice or the mortgageasaservice pieces brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay i did have one just one more question if reggie doesnt have any input there reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc no the only thing i would yeah the only thing i would say and i dont want to be redundant but we have pegged in plan for deposits to be essentially flat to slightly down and at this point in time we would not change that when i say slightly down were talking million to million on that base of billion or so so again we think we can kind of hold deposits weve been successful even through the first quarter and so theres no reason to think differently brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you and then i did have one more question just on the office side i appreciate you putting that in there i wanted to ask if you happen to know of the thats in manhattan you know where thats kind of geographically in manhattan like you know what percent is midtown you know versus the other neighborhoods reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc well follow back on that but i think the messaging is that you know we know our customers very well were very comfortable with the ltv the debt service coverage ratio and we could you know followup and get more granular there but clearly a lot of that business is generated from the longstanding relationships we had with our customers and a lot of that transactional growth has been driven off at exchanges so if you have a significant asset gain thats been in a family business for so many decades and value is created multifamily versus tre they kind of move around depending on market conditions thats been a history of our focus on this type of asset class but not in the business of doing office building financed in very rare circumstances so this is a culmination of many many years of relationship lending that tied out to the holistic position within the within the strong relationship of the legacy nycb and again we have we have no delinquencies we have no chargeoffs in the space if you look historically and going back some decades i think the overall loss content in cre is probably lower than multifamily may be indiscernible john basis points or john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc slightly lower than multifamily new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc so yeah we feel really confident in it but right now were seeing very strong performance no delinquencies no late pay and were working with our customers in the event there are some issues on just changes in square foot rent rolls however the ltvs are a very low and the relationships are very strong and we know the customer very well and i think john can then followup with more granularity we dont have it in front of us right now but we can get back to you as far as what streets they are on if its id say its more indiscernible we dont do c lending period and i think were probably more driven towards the more towards the b to b plusish but you know we stay away from the ctype situations brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thank you very much everyone i appreciate it operator thank you your next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is now live thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi good morning so i know theres a lots of puts and takes to like youve outlined obviously the uncertainty in the markets but the purchase and the function agreement for signature has provided a lot of liquidity and presented bigger growth opportunities like youve outlined im just wondering the initial targets from the flagstar deal including the ph roa roce the efficiency ratio would these be considered a bit conservative given the benefits of the signature deal like are these targets when you hit a more steady like run rate what will you be thinking here thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so im going to take it from a very high level and ill pass the baton to john again because these financial questions are on forwardlooking guidance we dont have a lot of forwardlooking guidance we gave some shortdated forwardlooking guidance but were very pleased on culturally putting the size of the transaction together its been a very good experience with the team senior team is doing a great job on focusing on getting the culture right and more importantly our integration plans are on target with that being said the mortgage business has been up and down and its a volatile business so we were very proactive right out of the right post our closing to rightsize that and that was the first step to ensure that we continue profitability and all interest rate environments new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 where we stand today our institution is in a very different place when it comes to liquidity when it comes to asset sensitivity versus liability sensitivity i cant remember ever being in the seat where we can talk about asset sensitivity so its a pretty good place to be and having tremendous optionality about the business and where were going to deploy that excess liquidity but i think i indicated previously that by sitting on cash right now and making those decisions were making a spread based on the transaction on signature standalone which is pretty attractive when our margin was i think closer to so as weve deployed the cash as you look at the round out of the commercial banking space you have a lot of verticals you have some great great opportunity to really round out the verticals build out the commercial bank and clearly focus on team build focusing on integrating the signature culture into the new flagstar culture and its going to be able you know keeping the teams focused and bringing those deposits back i mean i just dont underestimate the opportunity in front of us here that when there was a run in the system you know these accounts were not closed they were just moved out while our goal is to get a lot of that money back and be creative with our clients especially on the signature side to really be their white glove service thats the secret sauce of signature so thats an exciting opportunity for this institution and then we can take the growth in the future were looking at our brickandmortar locations in phenomenal parts of the country where we can take eric and erics team to start ramping up growth and continue doing what hes done very well for the past years which is build value so its an exciting time and i think when you think about overall returns this bank is not a traditional thrift model anymore its moving towards a commercial banking model and i feel very strongly that weve accelerated that with the signature transaction and the flagstar transaction by to years so thats a good place to be and thats just my opening tally so maybe john if you want to john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i think remember too when we announced that the flagstar transaction that was all the way back in april and yeah that was a totally different interest rate environment so just keep that in mind thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc were not at zero interest rate right john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc but were pleased within the ecosystem i really think theres a great opportunity on the mortgage ecosystem as lee smith alluded to we are going to go after deposit opportunities in all parts of our business and i think its an uncharted opportunity here but with the tpo channel with the relationships with the warehouse business we new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 want to have our share of compensating balances we have some great great team members here that are going to go after it and its going to be measured and strategized as a focus towards the new flagstar bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just to follow up you did provide some guide to expenses regarding signature which is helpful im just wondering you know from your talks and discussions with fdic you know i think there are a couple of things with the transition service agreement i believe that you know those the resulting conversation is what how you kind of like guide it i believe im not sure theres anything you can share on that specifically im not sure if thats still being hammered out and like what you kind of eluded to is that some of the costs could be elevated in the next couple of quarters im just wondering if anything you can share there and then obviously if discussions on the servicing the remaining loans have been discussed and you can share anything there lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb so yeah that process is ongoing were still just a little over a month from the transaction so that process is still ongoing so were working through exactly what loans what deposit what processes other assets other liabilities that were taking going through the whole pro forma analysis so yes that is one of the reasons why in the short term well be slightly higher than the run rate we talked about earlier from a servicing perspective we continue to service the loans for the fdic and well be reimbursed for our cost for the servicing of those loans and then once something happens and those loans are disposed of by the receiver theres always an opportunity to see what happens and who that buyer is to see if theres a longerterm potential benefit to continue servicing those loans depending on what the buyer wants so yeah no that process is ongoing as you can imagine it takes a little while to kind of finalize that as we go through but yes were working towards all of that as were speaking john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i would just add one comment on that whole process in respect to the real estate side of things we have its an inmarket transaction this is was our number one competitor in the multiseries space so theyre in new york were in new york and we have great consolidation opportunities to really take advantage of the opportunity to bring people together in the appropriate real estate setting so were excited about our team diving into that deeply we dont have a lot of time to make those decisions in conjunction with the contract that we signed with the fdic what we think is great opportunity here for efficiency bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is now live new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i want to start on given the strong retention of the signature teams im surprised you have been able to draw back some of the deposits they lost id imagine the teams are fairly well intended to do that i know its still early but what are you hearing from their customers right now thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so well its a great question and we were you know we went into this with the expectation of a much significant outflow because who knew whats going to happen on monday but whats most important is that the team is excited the team has the incentive plan to bring the money back to the bank and as well as different solutions right i think in general theres an industry where theres a reluctance to be well above uninsured right so we have to plan for that and be there for our clients and be creative and i think the creativity under erics leadership with his team is going to go after the opportunity and i think the way we structured it with the legacy signature model that they have you know strong incentive comp plans to be recognized based on our success on deposit gathering thats the model right steven so its early days right and when i mean the quarter win yet because its who knows what happens on monday this week so you just got to be very cognizant that i dont think that the marketplace is still out of the woods with respect to this volatility but theres no question that its stable which is great ill reiterate my point on dda its a rock it hasnt moved thats a phenomenal statistic that our operating dda accounts have actually was slightly up in the month of april compared to the closing of the transaction which is a testament to the need for the payroll accounts the operating accounts tied to the businesses but the push here is to go back and you know convince the customers that you know banking is overall is in a safe perspective and it was an idiosyncratic situation that happened in early march and ultimately the system is strong and highly regulated and we have to convince them thats our job to go out there and handhold the customers to get back the confidence in the system and thats what were doing and im very proud of my team because its been ongoing and even during in the depths of that crisis we were talking to many of our clients and look were a regional bank and we handle our customers its important its all about service on a standalone basis nycb folks that do a great job and now we put on flagstar and now opening our signature its all about service service and im going to reiterate again culture culture culture new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 and we have a tremendous opportunity in front of you to really make sure its client first and get them comfortable that you know with the stamp of approval of doing a transaction this magnitude in the depths of a dark situation in banking i think it goes a long way when you talk to clients about the safety and soundness of our institution steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it let me let me followup on that tom so you basically doubled the size of the company in a few quarters and if we learn anything particularly from svb its that they grew so quickly that they probably outgrew their capabilities in risk management im sure your risk management is fine or else the regulators would not have given you the stamp of approval you just talked about but you also just said in response to the prior question that you accelerated the transformation of the company by years with these two deals so talk about the risk management infrastructure that you have today how much do you have to now invest in it people systems et cetera and how should we think about the cost of that thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so i would say to you steven this goes back to legacy indiscernible right we went to a journey at if i recall when i was cfo it was about five years at the time holding the line at and not crossing over an average so that until we really built a position to understand what was expected as our regulatory framework was uniquely different than some others which gave us a lot of oversight at the time to be with indiscernible and obviously those rules and pronouncements have changed but weve held through that our position that we were going to have a bank that could be ready to be billion that goes back to when we started that journey back in or and its been a constant reinvestment over time so were really excited about where we are theres always going to be updates its always going to be evolving especially given the regulatory landscape that were in currently because who knows whats going to come out of this i will call a mini crisis of confidence but i dont think its going to get easier but you know were prepared to do what we have to do to manage a safe and sound organization and risk management is our number one focus right so we have a tremendous team and im proud of my risk team and i do a great job and were going to add a lot of new people from all three organizations together as well as from the outside and be ready for whats required for us as a highly regulated institution but this is nothing new to us its just something weve been working on for quite some time and were prepared to make sure we have the highest standard and john if you want to add a little bit more comments on this john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and i think you know what tom mentioned just to add when you look at some of the capital stress testing and liquidity stress testing frameworks that we built within that timeframe well serve us extremely well here as we integrate both flagstar and signature onto those models from a stress testing perspective you know our teams built those with the expectation of the billion threshold that were at now so you know theres always there will always be some incremental add but we dont think itll be a material ad given the structure in the backbone that we already have in place new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and i think in general youre looking at operating leverage now right this is something weve been geared up and we assume the flagstar transaction release we were ready to be at that trillion mark and getting ready but we were there as far as operationally moving from that direction and at the same time we get the offering leverage were making very substantial investments going back to early days and we just continue to evolve from that so obviously its the most important aspect of this company going forward is handling risk given the nature of the bank and our new products but were clearly excited and id say years its really more the transformation from thrift to a commercial bank thats a milestone of the vision to take a traditional thrift mentality and bring it to the commercial banking platform and having these great team members that come from all over the country with tremendous banking experience in commercial operations and dealing with the high touch white glove service thats the transition so i think thats what is acceleration and having different verticals having different products weve completely changed the dynamic of who we are going forward as the new flagstar steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats helpful and just one final and maybe for john so you said you expect margin expansion through the rest of this year one what rate assumptions like which rate backdrop are you assuming and two which is even more important given the new balance sheet mix whats better for your margin for the fed to start cutting rates in the second half or if the fed goes up and then holds for the rest of the year like which of those backdrops is better for this balance sheet thanks john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so in a very short period of time weve gone from on a standalone nycb sensitive to pretty significantly liability sensitive to layering in the flagstar transaction which got us to slightly moderately liability sensitive and now laying on signature where were moderately asset sensitive so we have an asset sensitive balance sheet right now that has an awful lot of flexibility in it given the cash that we have on the balance sheet so theres a lot of flexibility a lot of easy ways to kind of to move that asset sensitivity around in the shortterm but to answer your question yeah we would benefit from a fed raise right now and when we look at when were with the modeling to get to the next quarter or so is increase a couple of items there that i mentioned we are expecting one more rate hike here in the bloomberg forecast next week and then pretty flat for the end of the year there might be one at the end i think theres one cut that we forecasted in at the end of the year but when you look at whats coming due especially in the second quarter thats going to help pick up a little bit to the margin thats one of the main drivers as well as well as what tom has mentioned which is just the noninterestbearing percentage and the stability that weve seen so far in those deposits thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and so steven big picture for us is that were in a very unique position given the fact that we have a balance sheet that is very versatile we have tremendous optionality given its sitting in cash and as i indicated new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 previously that lets say will yield in the cash temporarily and we picked up the liabilities at around so the spread on that is about its still above our margin so as we if we have to shift we have a position of cash to make that a smooth transition to rebalance ourselves depending on what policy is going to be driving the fed so were in a very interesting spot in respect to balance sheet steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you your next question comes from the line of matthew breese from stephens please go ahead your line is now live matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning matt reginald e davis a senior executive vice president president of banking new york community bancorp inc morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i just wanted to go back to the signature deposits down less than expected versus expectations for from here how much more runoff if any do you expect and over what timeframe thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc just well just from a street modeling perspective we havent changed our modeling when were looking when were looking at forecasting to the original were cautiously optimistic that we wont see you know anywhere near that that run off and hopefully potentially could see some growth once this really and continues to stabilize but right now from a forecast perspective we havent changed our initial modeling of the runoff matthew breese q analyst stephens inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 okay and then for the quarter what was accretive yield prepayment penalty income and then looking forward with signature what are your expectations for ph accretable yield through the end of the year thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so prepayment penalty income for the year was i think million so you know really really small number on the on the prepayment side on the accretable yield perspective with signature were looking at our best estimate now is picking up about million a year thats what were looking at if you look at the mark that we booked its about a four or fiveyear average maturity we are still of course finalizing that process as we go through all of our purchase accounting items but we think its going to be around that million range matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and thats the thats the added accretion what was it for the quarter and maybe just because it was a partial quarter with signature a full quarter for flagstar give me some idea of thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah really yeah very very small amount for signature i think the number was in the million range million to million range ill get you the flagstar accretion number i dont have that in front of me matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay could you comment a little bit on and understanding that business today is much more diversified than it has been historically but gives us some sense for new loan yields today and what the rollon versus rolloff dynamics are thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so matt it was interesting whats happening for us given the market conditions in commercial real estate and multifamily our spreads are basis point spread off of the fiveyear treasury with a minimum of percent coupon so youre not seeing much fixed rate product being done at all in general but weve introduced this over the past year which i think is a very interesting opportunity for our customers if their choice is having synthetic opportunities to think about structuring a transaction as to fix the float and we get the opportunity to put a floating rate instrument which is thought weve never done before so with that being said i think we put on about just when repricing about billion of our multifamily businesses now tied to indiscernible plus which came off about and now its yielding about as they figure out what theyre going to do maybe next year if rates were to go lower and well make decisions upon the financing that in the future but thats been a very positive balance sheet contributor to having a more versatile asset sensitive balance sheet so its tied to floating rates many customers now are contemplating on putting on a swap and doing a floating rate structure with us and then at the same time we were also introducing our capital markets business which has a sizable benefit to sell them protection on that and be able to structure the transaction where we generate our fee income so thats part of our model going forward new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 now we want we havent a model that in but thats what were seeing in the business and most of the other products are all floating rates so you know to add significant spreads so thats going to be the ongoing benefit of versatility within the asset classes but it is a change in the market when it comes to multifamily story because of just the tightening of credit theres no question that credit has tightened when it comes to the offering and i think most banks are around that level within quarter spread of the fiveyear treasury as an offering and i think many customers are just kind of waiting and see what to do and you dont see a lot of actual transaction when a transaction does take place i think the financing cost is very different than it was a year ago which i think will be an advantage to the bank as long as they can handle the debt service coverage ratios right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc right and actually that brings to my next question just as all eyes are on office cre these days rent regulated multifamily has had its challenges on the top line given the red guidelines board as youve seen those types of loans reset today coming out of vintages how have debt service coverage ratios reacted to higher rates and have you had to do anything with those borrowers like lower rates or extend amortization periods just to keep them going and keep them operating the properties thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and given that were a low leveraged lender ltv is a traditionally lower we underwrite very differently than some of our competitors we havent had to have those conversations as of today what we are seeing is that when theyre in an option period theyre choosing a indiscernible option versus the home loan bank spread option which is too punitive and in very rare circumstances youre seeing refinance activities so were getting the benefit of pricing a coupon at the in the car marketplace now its a lot cheaper for them last year but rates are elevated but were still seeing consistency on no delinquencies no lay pays and customers are thinking about probably next year though theyll take this option and come back to the bank if rates are lower so theyre making a i guess a decision in the future to come back to the bank when they feel its necessary but its been very very consistent on a monthly basis again the growth on the multifamily side has been very slow its going to be id say relatively flat but whats interesting about our portfolio im not sure exactly but maybe john has it probably its probably billion billion coming due on that same roll period on credit to have to refinance or i actually have the option and right now were seeing about of those customers take the option which is a nice pickup for our margin matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood i appreciate it ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah operator thank you your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead your line is now live new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning just a couple of points of clarification from me you noted you will continue to use the excess cash to pay down borrowings does the pace of that accelerate beyond the second quarter or are you doing a majority of what you intend to do in the second quarter itself john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so were going to continue to look at the market conditions that were in but right now we expect to pay down borrowings as theyre coming due we just have most of our borrowings coming due in the second quarter we got a little piece coming due in the third and the fourth as well so the plan is to pay down borrowings throughout the year depending of course on our liquidity position and other items loan growth one item you know just to keep in mind with our securities portfolio being so low and the securities asset percentage well hold a little bit more cash on the balance sheet just as a placeholder for that piece as well but yeah the current plan is to continue to pay down borrowings well look to pay down some of our wholesale deposits like broker deposits as we mentioned earlier as they come due depending on market conditions and where cost is on deposits like that thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and just to add the point there when i took over as ceo i made it very clear our challenge and our strategy is to be less dependent on financing to wholesale liabilities to run this business to transition from a thrift to a commercial bank and going back to the acceleration of the business for years this is a lot of liabilities that are not subject to wholesale liabilities by traditional commercial banking and going back to the bda growth to of total deposits that is in my opinion an acceleration of where we have to be as a successful business and were super proud that were able to have a better funding mix to generate better returns over time so this is going to be very powerful towards the story as we continue to honein on commercial accounts and the bda side of things as well as relationship banking manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so is it fair to say that despite the high asset sensitivity from the deals if the fed does start to cut rates gradually next year you should still see some sort of benefit to nim from cutting costs to funding thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 so lets say this were in a very interesting position given that my whole career at nycb weve been liability centered so were excited about our balance sheet positioning and we think we have versatility and optionality to make the decision when that does take place but if youre in if you look at forward side fund futures and the one and done they hold for a while if they raise it being indiscernible they will make more money and then well adjust accordingly but having the versatility of cash makes that a little easier to make decisions on that versus having you know fixed rate assets that are lockedin long term we have sitting on lots of cash right now to make those determination as we redeploy into assets that are more commercial bank like in traditional ph flip type assets manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and just the last question for me just given all the moving pieces in the quarter do you have what the spot deposit costs are as of march or as of april thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah interestbearing deposits are manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you that will be for our last question i
