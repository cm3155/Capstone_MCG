corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 strategic activity which is reflected in our backlog im starting todays presentation with a strategic update and denis will provide comments on the financial results beginning on page we aspire to be the worlds most exceptional financial institution united by our shared values of client service partnership integrity and excellence and over the last years we have created one of the most aspirational brands in financial services goldman sachs is the preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management weve continued to simplify our strategy and today is an opportunity to take stock of our progress as well as highlight avenues for further growth strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence and to further strengthen our client franchise as we show on page we have two worldclass and interconnected franchises that are wellpositioned to achieve these strategic objectives first global banking markets which includes our topranked investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and a leading capital markets business it also includes our number one equities franchise and top three ficc franchise where we are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products and second our unified asset wealth management business where we are a leading global active asset manager with a top five alternative business and premier ultrahigh net worth wealth management franchise this is a scaled business with over trillion in assets under supervision and where we see significant opportunity for further growth across these two businesses our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our one goldman sachs operating ethos on page we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent investor day in february in global banking markets weve maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking in ficc and equities we have improved our standing with the top clients we generated record total financing revenues across these businesses in and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years in asset wealth management weve driven solid investment performance and consistent growth and a more durable revenue base of management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues this past year we reduced our historical principal investments by billion and also surpassed our fiveyear alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule i will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment before i do i would like to speak about how weve narrowed our strategic focus we made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them we exited the marcus lending business and sold substantially all of our marcus loan portfolio we sold our personal financial management business we announced the sale of greensky which remains on track to close this quarter we also sold the majority of our greensky loan portfolio which settled in the fourth quarter weve also reached an agreement with general motors regarding the process to transition their credit card program to another issuer we remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements and our consumer activities i firmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth but it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed our consumer ambitions have produced over billion of deposits which we expect to grow further from here these deposits have materially improved the firms funding profile now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win we recognize that scale matters as it allows the firm to operate more efficiently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs making unit economics more favorable and we need to be measured and focused in our execution our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position scale and exceptional talent on page in global banking markets our leading and diversified franchise has produced average revenues of the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 billion over the last four years across a number of different market environments demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate in the last several years we made a concerted effort to grow our wallet share and financing revenues which have clearly raised the revenue floor for these businesses we have also generated attractive returns with an average roe fully allocated of over over the last four years turning to page a key part of enhancing this durability has been executing on our strategic priorities our efforts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly basis points since weve maintained our league table rankings of number one in announced and completed ma number one in equity and equityrelated underwriting number two in highyield debt in ficc and equities were in the top three with of our top clients these competitive positions are a reflection of our one goldman sachs approach and our clients confidence in us in addition we have significantly increased more durable financing revenues ficc and equity financing together have grown at a cagr since to a new record of nearly billion turning to asset wealth management on page we continued to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams management and other fees in private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a cagr of since weve also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pretax margin target on an adjusted basis turning to page our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inflows over of our traditional funds performed in the top half of morningstar funds while on alternatives over of our funds were in the top half of cambridge funds both over the last five years the fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of longterm feebased net inflows across our platform i want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over billion in alternatives since surpassing our billion target a year early this fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation in developing a new strategy as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and longstanding track records fundraising has been broadbased across geographies and asset classes with approximately coming from our ultrahigh net worth relationships im very proud of this achievement when we were preparing for our first investor day four years ago i remember how big a reach our initial target of billion seemed we surpassed not only that target but also our increased target of billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business putting all this together on page you can see how much weve improved the durability of revenues across the firm on this slide baseline revenues are shown in gray which represent the sum of the trailing tenyear lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical namely advisory underwriting and intermediation we believe this is a very conservative measurement because its unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time in fact in all of the years since we became a public company it has never happened in dark blue you can see the more durable revenues from financing management and other fees as well as private banking and lending which in aggregate have grown at cagr since taken together these two components make up over of revenues in on top of that we consistently generate upside across different market environments because of our diversified franchises the increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams coupled with the diversification of our scaled franchise of our ability to capture upside demonstrate the revenue generating power of our firm narrowing our strategic focus our leadership team spent a significant amount of time in realigning the firms priorities with our strategic vision our values and our strengths which we highlighted on page youve heard us talk about many of these elements before starting with our strategic objectives first to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 harness one goldman sachs to serve our clients with excellence second to run worldclass differentiated and durable businesses third to invest and operate at scale as you can see on the page our execution focus areas for are aligned with these strategic objectives taking one example investing in our people and culture exceptional quality of our people supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients most consequential problems and its imperative that we continue to invest in them all and these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes we continue to be a trusted advisor to our clients to be an employer of choice for our people and to generate midteens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return with everything we achieved in coupled with our clear and simplified strategy we have a much stronger platform for i feel very confident about the future of goldman sachs our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders i will now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning let me start on page of the presentation in we generated net revenues of billion net earnings of billion and earnings per share of as david highlighted we made significant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus we provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions as well as the impact of the fdic special assessment fees on the slide in aggregate these items reduced full year net earnings by billion earnings per share by and our roe by percentage points turning to performance by business starting on page global banking markets generated revenues of billion for the year down as higher equities revenues were more than offset by a decline in ficc revenues and investment banking fees versus last year in the fourth quarter investment banking fees of billion fell yearoveryear driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in for we maintained our number one league table position in announced and completed ma as well as in equity and equityrelated underwriting and ranked second in highyield debt underwriting our backlog rose quarteronquarter driven by a significant increase in advisory as david mentioned we are encouraged by the robust level of dialogues with our corporate client base and though were only two weeks into the new year there have been solid levels of capital markets activity in both the us and europe ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter down from strong performance last year amid lower activity in rates and other macro products in ficc financing revenues rose to a record million equities net revenues were billion in the quarter up yearonyear the yearoveryear increase in intermediation revenues was driven by better results in derivatives financing revenues of billion rose yearoveryear with continued strength on higher average balances across ficc and equities financing revenues rose in consistent with our priority to grow client financing moving to asset wealth management on page for revenues of billion rose yearoveryear as an increase in more durable revenues including record management and other fees and record private banking and lending revenues offset a decline in equity investment revenues and incentive fees fourth quarter management and other fees of billion were up yearoveryear full year management and other fees were billion putting us on track to hit our billion target in notwithstanding the sale of our pfm business equity investments produced net revenues of million higher yearoveryear driven by modest gains in our public portfolio versus losses in the fourth quarter of last year results in this line item also included a gain of the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 million from the sale of pfm moving on to page total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record trillion driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and alternative assets and representing our 24th consecutive quarter of longterm fee based net inflows turning to page on alternatives alternative assets under supervision totaled billion at the end of the fourth quarter driving million in management and other fees for the quarter and billion for the year surpassing our billion target for gross thirdparty fundraising was billion for the quarter and billion for the year as david mentioned thirdparty fundraising since our investor day now stands at over billion onbalance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately billion of which roughly billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio in the fourth quarter we reduced this portfolio by over billion including sales of billion of cies across over positions bringing reductions for the year to billion we continue to focus on exiting this portfolio over the mediumterm though we dont expect portfolio reductions in to be at the same pace as in ill now turn to platform solutions on page full year revenues were billion up versus quarterly net revenues of million were up yearoveryear on higher consumer platform results amid growth in average credit card balances as david mentioned we reached an agreement with general motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer the impact of which was to move the loans to heldforsale and release the associated loan loss reserves of approximately million we have no additional updates regarding our credit card partnerships at this time on page firmwide net interest income of billion in the fourth quarter was down relative to the third quarter reflecting an increase in funding costs supporting trading activities our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion modestly higher versus the third quarter reflecting an increase in other collateralized lending which includes the pools of signature banks capital call facilities we won at auction in october our provision for credit losses was million in relation to our consumer portfolio provisions were driven by net chargeoffs and seasonal balance growth partially offset by the gm reserve release i mentioned for our wholesale portfolio provisions were driven by impairments that were generally in line with the last two quarters with roughly half related to cre lets turn to expenses on page total operating expenses for the year were billion excluding severance related costs of million compensation expense was flat yearoveryear amid solid core performance and as the market for talent remains competitive as of the fourth quarter we achieved our goal of million in run rate payroll efficiencies which allowed us to continue investing in our talent quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion and included cie impairments of million the yearoveryear increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the fdic special assessment fee of million our effective tax rate for was for we expect a tax rate of to turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach basis points above our current capital requirement of in the fourth quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion at an average price of and common stock dividends of million while we expect to remain nimble with respect to capital return given the ongoing uncertainty around the basel iii proposed rule our capital management philosophy is unchanged we prioritize supporting client deployment opportunities sustainably growing our dividend and returning excess to shareholders in the form of buybacks particularly when valuation levels are attractive in conclusion we made solid progress on narrowing our strategic focus in with our execution driving a much stronger platform for our bestinclass core businesses are wellpositioned to execute on our strategic objectives we will continue to harness one goldman sachs to serve our clients with excellence run worldclass differentiated and durable businesses and invest to operate our businesses at scale the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 additionally the execution focus areas weve identified for will help us drive the outcomes of delivering for clients our people and our shareholders with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so i wanted to get on marktomarket youve been rightfully cautious but optimistic on green shoots becoming a reality in investment banking you definitely saw some momentum in the fourth quarter so curious and you mentioned that the pipeline is up quarteronquarter so maybe just differentiate between what youre seeing on the corporate side versus sponsor side and just get the marktomarket on how youre feeling thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure sure glenn i mean just at a base level im pretty optimistic given the way weve got the firm positioned and theres no question that the capital markets and ma activity levels has been depressed as ive said before i dont think that continues yearonyearonyear and we really started to see in the second half of this year real improvement as denis highlighted the ma backlog saw really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter and ill just highlight i know this is obvious but i think its worth stating we put up billion of ma revenue if the backlog is growing that means weve got to replace the billion that we put up plus then have growth so thats a very very strong replenishment and i would just say the level of strategic dialogue has definitely increased and were seeing it across our platform im encouraged by capital markets activity im not going to say its running back to 10year averages right away but it has materially improved i do think youre going to see some more meaningful ipos in and we are just across debt and equity issuance seeing more activity and more engagement at the end of the day people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time but theyve got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market and were seeing that come through so when i look broadly it feels better theres a lot going on in the world and so i think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry of the time about the of things that can go wrong so were going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the firm but i do think the firm is incredibly welllevered for this pickup and it feels better is the way id frame it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right cool maybe just a followup on that note reducing the onbalance sheet investments as you mentioned is an important part of the roe improvement for asset wealth and for goldman overall so with that said the markets are higher pipelines better how come the balance sheet reduction of onbalance sheet investments might be slower this year when the intent i think is to get rid of all of it at the right price the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah first of all i think we made a lot of progress last year and so if you look at what we accomplished i think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful especially given the environment one of the things that happened is we pulled some stuff forward that we didnt expect to monetize in into and so to be clear our focus is to get that to zero as quickly as possible if youre operating inside this firm and youre operating in that business you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible but we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately we set a clear target over the next three years to get to zero my guess is weve got a good shot if we execute at doing that quicker than that glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi fair enough all right thanks david david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah operator thank you well go next to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to spend some time on the ficc business so if im looking at the right number it seems like ficc revenues are now back to precovid levels if you go back to of maybe if you can unpack it just looking at slide seems like most products were quite weak give us some perspective around both the intermediation fees of ficc does that feel like were close to trough and unlike seasonality we should see some improvement in ficc from here if you can just provide some perspective there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i mean at a high level what i would say this quarter intermediation activity was quiet and particularly in the back half of the quarter kind of late november and december clients were quiet if you look at the whole year i dont think its fair i dont have the numbers in front of me but i dont think its fair to say the whole year is back to revenue the overall activity levels were up and down during the year we have a big diversified business when our clients are active we execute on it we continue to grow the financing revenues which make it overall more durable but it was a quiet quarter particularly the back half in terms of intermediation i dont expect it to continue at that pace i think denis comments in the opening were seeing more activity in the first the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 few weeks of the year but well watch it and as you know that activity particularly in that segment can move up and down based on whats going on in the macro environment ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and maybe just sticking to ficc or maybe both ficc and equity on the financing side if you dont mind reminding us of the opportunity to grow financing over the next year or over the medium term thank you denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thanks ebrahim so weve been clear over the last several years that we see opportunities to grow both ficc and equity financing and its a virtuous activity for us it dovetails well with our focus on clients and our focus on market share we have a lot of expertise in this space and we see a lot of demand from clients for us to deploy both into ficc and equities we now have a leading equities franchise overall our equities financing business is in a leadership position and at scale it has grown significantly and we continue to see opportunities to increase the activities that we do with our existing clients and bring new clients onto the platform so we look out into and we continue to be very focused and think theres good opportunities across both ficc and equity financing in gbm ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs mr hawken please go ahead your line is open please check your mute function brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sorry sorry about that thanks for taking my questions this morning so i was curious about the impact that we should be thinking about around the potential exit from the apple relationship i know its an ongoing thing but maybe is there anything that you could provide that might help us think about how that impact could flow through david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc denis said in his comments weve got no other updates on the credit card partnerships other than what he stated we continue to work with apple on a partnership with them to serve our customers and to continue to reduce the drag from the partnership and we continue to make good progress and the drag in will be materially less brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay i appreciate that and then when you think about the deposit platform marcus thats been a pretty bright spot on the consumer front and definitely seems to have worked well what has been your views or how has the beta on that deposit base played out versus your expectations and do you have any plans to adjust your thoughts around earlier you talked about wanting to be in the top decile of payouts for that product is that still the goal or has that adjusted as the platform has matured the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure brennan thank you for that question our marcus deposit platform has been a real strategic advantage to us in terms of overall firmwide funding we did set out a strategy to set our pricing at the higher end of the pricing envelope to maintain sustain and grow our balances across that platform we havent adjusted our strategy at this point we saw good growth across our various strategic deposit funding channels last year not just marcus overall deposits were up over billion on the year and i would just say as we move into we continue to focus on driving growth across the strategic channels and be thoughtful about our overall funding mix operator thank you well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi david you started off the call saying that was the year of execution and this year when you had an roe of and if we throw in some of the charges its and thats not really executing at your or so desired return so can you give us a kind of waterfall chart in words on how you get from that core roe to and if you can define mediumterm david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so i appreciate the question mike and obviously were very focused on it it wasnt an a environment for our core business in fact i dont even think it was a b environment when investment banking is operating at low levels that is an impact overall i do think that its important to look at our core business of banking and markets which is a very significant portion of the firm and do note on a fully allocated basis in this environment which was not a b or an a environment given the investment banking activity and at a roe we continue to believe through the cycle that that business is a midteens business and so i dont think were going to stay at the level of activities that weve been at and we have that business positioned very well and so youll get some upside returns there at a better environment and then secondarily in asset wealth management we continue to reduce the balance sheet the balance sheet has been a drag on returns but i think weve been pretty clear that we can drive the asset wealth management with a smaller balance sheet to midteens returns or better with a margin were on that journey were making progress i think well make very good progress over the next two years and if you look at those two businesses thats the vast vast majority of the firm and i think they can operate in midteens weve significantly reduced the other drags weve got a lot of it behind us this year that doesnt mean there wont be anything but the drag from platforms in will be materially reduced from what its been and so i think were making good progress in the mediumterm is over the next couple of years provided that its a reasonable environment so i think youll see good progress on the overall positioning of the firm over the next three to five years mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just to follow up that other drag you said would be a lot less in from platform solutions and can you dimension that a little bit and also as it relates to principal investments do the higher stock markets help the disposition or not so much the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc they absolutely do i mean when markets improve they help the disposition theres no question i also when you look at the last two years weve had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that but on a much smaller balance sheet in with a better market you actually might have some benefit to revenue performance but were focused on reducing that broadly you see you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on greensky move gm to heldforsale and so you have more transparency on that we think the drag will be significantly reduced in when were comfortable providing more specific color on that we will provide it but small mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc right thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc in the overall context of the firm and the firms performance mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you operator well go next to devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey thanks so much morning david and denis a question just on kind of interplay between the recovering investment banking versus trading intermediation and i know theres probably a lot of assumptions that need to go in here but if you think about kind of the environment with macro conditions settling down which would likely support investment banking im assuming some areas of trading could also slow down and then maybe other areas could pick up as well so just love to maybe hear a little bit about kind of the puts and takes kind of what youve seen historically there if easier and just really kind of the key question is just whether you can grow investment banking revenues and trading exfinancing at the same time thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so at a high level devin appreciate the question i think we can continue to grow our financing activity given the scale and the size of the market the way market activity is growing and we will normalize investment banking activity and obviously over time given our position and if you assume growth in the world growth in the market cap of the world we will continue as we have for the last years grow our investment banking activity when theres real disruption in the world we find that ficc can be a little bit countercyclical in some way the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 shape or form but thats not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation or market activity i think theres a lot going on in the world the trajectory of rates theres a point of view on rates and inflation but its certainly not certain to me i think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment theres debates about how the fed continues on its quantitative tightening or doesnt continue on its quantitative tightening so all of this i think will continue to play into people being active in markets so i do think just at a high level look this is high level i think the environment in feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in but im not a good predictor and were prepared to operate in whatever environment we have to operate in devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc understood i appreciate that david maybe a quick followup for denis just commercial real estate clearly a big headwind in appreciate all the disclosure there office onbalance sheet totaling billion now so when you think about just the environment relative to current marks how do you feel about kind of the pain being behind the company and just characterize the environment where maybe there still could be material marks and then just more broadly kind of expectations for marks as you exit the historical cre onbalance sheet principal investments thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure devin thank you and as you know we have new disclosure the last couple quarters on cre in particular on the nature of the loans in that sector and then as well as the onbalance sheet both cre and office in particular you can obviously see from those disclosures weve made substantial progress moving down the positions over the course of i gave disclosure on the number of cie positions that we moved down recently and weve made really significant progress we disclosed on prior calls that our office exposures from an impairment and marks perspective were sitting at roughly so we think that based on the visibility that we had and the activity that we had over the course of that that portfolio and the broader portfolio for that matter sits at the right place as we move into there should be opportunities for further dispositions and well remain very focused on what the mix of that disposition activity is when david was reviewing our expectations with respect to hbi selldown on the forward in addition to moving towards our mediumterm target were also mindful of what the longterm franchise impact of those selldown activities are so just to give you a sense for why we may have cautioned on pace we have some meaningful credit exposures where we enjoy a position of incumbency and for the longterm benefit of the franchise we very much hope that well remain as a lender and a supporter of those clients to exit those positions in advance of a potential refinancing would be to surrender our incumbency position and so were being thoughtful so that we can continue to reduce our risk while continuing to grow the thirdparty fund management business while supporting clients in the process devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great thanks so much operator thank you well go next to ryan kenny with morgan stanley the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning and thanks for taking my question so you highlighted in the prepared remarks that goldman surpassed your fundraising target in alternatives so as we look forward can you give some more color on your strategy to grow particularly in private credit any update on how big you expect to get in private credit how it complements your dcm and wealth franchises and maybe any risks that we should be thinking about would be helpful thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure appreciate the question its obviously something ryan were very very focused on we feel good about the fundraising progress weve made i think when you look forward in you could expect us to raise another billion to billion of alternatives were obviously very focused on private credit we do operate at scale in private credit we have over billion of private credit but i think the opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale in private credit especially given the way our franchise is positioned and the origination connection we have with our broad banking business gives us a unique platform and a unique competitive advantage so were going to continue to keep this focus it doesnt stop because we met our goal our goal was meant to flame the opportunity set years ago but youll see us continue to raise money on a yeartoyear basis and weve got some big funds that were going to be in the market with in and well continue to build the partnerships with that client base and both myself john waldron and the broad team across our asset management division are spending a lot of time with the big capital allocators all over the world and continuing to invest in those relationships ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then basel endgame comment letters are due today so now that you and other gsibs have had time to digest the proposal could you give us an update on how goldman might advance with that if the potential final rule comes through and how the proposals might impact your to throughthecycle rote target david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure well obviously today marks the end of the comment period and what i would say is its certainly not the end of the process in fact i would say its the end of the beginning of the process and so were moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with the regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders given our significant concern with the proposed rules youll see comment letters from us from our peers youll also see many letters from end users including pension funds insurance companies corporates who are particularly concerned about how this rule could affect their access to capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risks in their business and i think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry and also i think disadvantages the us from a competitive perspective so to be clear my view is the rule was not proposed appropriately and it should be withdrawn and reproposed i dont think speculating on the impact of the rule as proposed i think theres a pretty significant view out there that the fed is listening carefully theyre taking in the feedback and i dont think theres anyone thats looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed were very flexible with our capital as ive said before if the rules put certain changes in place well also adjust businesses or pricing in businesses and certain activity the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 to adapt i think to speculate as to how well talk about this once its in place before we have any idea what the rule is going to look like is premature but weve got a lot of capital flexibility and weve proven over time we can be particularly nimble and so well continue to focus ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning as you think about your efficiency targets whats a reasonable level of growth for non comp expense as we excluding obviously all the onetimers this year and maybe what the areas of investment are indiscernible priorities when you think about denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks dan so the efficiency ratio is something we are laserfocused on we continue to orient the firm to drive towards our target you mentioned the impact of selected items and if you take the impact over the course of the efficiency ratio would have been more like thats obviously not where we want it to be but significantly better than the fully reported number we have a number of initiatives across the firm to get after our noncompensation expense we had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efficiency targets at the end of last year rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year we have a ton of different categories were in the process of reviewing each and every category of our non compensation expense benchmarking it reviewing kpis thinking about our processes incentive structures governance things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efficiently as possible we do see an impact of inflation across these activities and its for that reason that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible i think as we look into if you take a look at the disclosure around selected items we dont expect those types of activities to repeat and well be very very remain very very focused on maintaining our overall noncomp expense spend and the other component of the efficiency ratio is obviously compensation expense you saw that over the course of this year we maintained our payforperformance orientation with respect to how we size that and you should expect the same on the forward in that is obviously a performancebased and variable component of our overall expense there are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable our largest items like compensation as well as transaction expenses are variable so well have to see how the types of activities unfold into and what the mix of our activities are to ultimately determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efficiency ratio daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and a followup on wealth management you disclosed of the alternative inflows since have come from the wealth channel curious if that was consistent throughout that time period and whether the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 you view that level of contribution as sustainable and also just the economics to goldman sachs how it differs between that in wealth and the externally how does that whats the difference in revenues david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well at a high level that comment looks over the past four years as weve grown our asset management business asset wealth management business and it highlights the alternative raising over that period this initial period of investment what the mix has been between wealth the institutional client base or other channels like thirdparty wealth retail et cetera when you look at our strategy dan we if you go back years most of our fundraising for these activities came from our private wealth channel and the percentage of the money we managed was much higher than from private wealth so as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community the sovereign wealth community areas where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding that percentage of wealth funding will probably decrease but im not going to speculate exactly where it will go at scale the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive theyre attractive in the private wealth channel and theyre attractive in our institutional partnerships but as i think you all know theyre not exactly identical and people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate billion definitely have a different economic proposition than somebody thats giving you million or million and thats been consistent in the business for a long long time so were continuing to scale the business we have real margin targets in the business i think weve got lots of opportunities and were still in the early stages of using the platform of goldman sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the benefit of our scale asset wealth management platform and im confident well continue to make good progress daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator thank you well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning theres obviously all the uncertainty on the capital as discussed earlier but just in the near term how do you think about capital allocation youre obviously continuing to lean into financing which is capital intensive depending on how banking and if banking comes back that can consume capital and then just touch on interest in bolton deals and then obviously ending on buybacks which were pretty solid in thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc ill start and denis might add some comments weve always said that when theres activity to support our clients thats our primary focus on where we can allocate capital weve increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise our client franchises over the course of the last five years and i think one of the reasons why our big broad global banking markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in different environments the way its performed is weve been very very focused on making sure we have the capital and the financial resources to serve our client base well where we see opportunities we will continue to deploy capital there thats in our broad capital planning program we do generate a lot of capital from earnings and to the degree that we dont see opportunities to deploy it with our clients we will return it to shareholders the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 at the moment were taking a more conservative posture around that just given some of the uncertainty around basel iii endgame although again i think thats going to continue to evolve and i also think we have a long track record of being very very nimble with our ability to deploy so were going to continue to focus on making sure weve got the right resources to serve our clients and as we generate capital and we have confidence in our capital position well return capital to shareholders and weve been very focused as youve seen on growing the dividend and we plan to continue to do that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just separately following up on the exit of legacy onbalance sheet principal investments is there an expense reduction opportunity as those investments in some of the infrastructure goes away over time david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc there is an operating leverage story which is one of the reasons why the margin in our asset wealth management business will continue to improve when we were running an onbalance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of onbalance sheet position the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions creates a business thats scaled differently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone elses alternative platform and so were early in the journey ill just to give a simple example we went out last year yearandahalf ago and raised our first growth equity fund we used to do that business on balance sheet we have lots and lots of positions and therefore a very very broad team to service that we raised our first fund we need a smaller team to manage that fund but when you go and raise your second fund you dont need to increase the scale of the team and so theres real operating leverage in that and thats part of our margin improvement story in asset wealth management over time so the answer is yes i dont want to overstate this because its not a massive part of the story but it is a place we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund form matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you for the color operator thank you well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning david good morning denis david in your david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning in your prepared remarks david you were talking about i think it was slide or but about the success in growing the relationships with those top ficc and equity clients and you identified that the ficc and equity financing contributed to that success and thats been a real hallmark for you guys over the last two or three years the growth in that business can you dig down for us and share with us what has attributed to the success is it the capital you put into that business the hiring of additional folks or people in the business and as well as competition has the competition been more challenged than some of your competitors the old credit suisse is no longer around but if you could give us a little more color on whats driving that success david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure gerard at a high level id point to a couple things but id start with the fact that that business is a scaled business and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of firms that really does operate those businesses at scale and i think thats just important as a baseline but i think there are a handful of things that weve done well first one gs and our one gs ethos if you go back historically we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience and clients would come into the firm in different places and get different experiences and we spent a lot of time this goes back to really thinking about how do these clients experience the firm and we went out we talked to them we listened to their feedback they really wanted to deal with the firm as a partner one partner i think weve made through one gs and that ethos real progress in dealing with those very large clients in this business in an integrated approach thats improved their experience and because its improved their experience they feel more partnerlike with us and therefore thats improved our wallet share secondarily weve become a much bigger financer of their activities and when you finance their activities you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem and number three weve also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view a very longterm approach to transacting with them they need our help sometimes with things that arent that economically attractive we want to be there if you do that you do that consistently you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive and so i think those three things combined with our scaled platform have really helped us when we look at our wallet share we continue to spend a lot of time john and i spend a lot of time and denis too talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business asking for their feedback and as we get that feedback well continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence and as you saw from the presentation that we put up one of the things that were really focused on is how our one gs operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction its a big big tenet of what were trying to do gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i know youve talked about the pipelines in your comments about what we might be able to see in ecm and other areas this year can you also give us a little flavor on what parts of since youre obviously a global force what parts of the globe are you seeing the best potential is it the americas is it europe or is it asia the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well its scale the americas is the biggest part of the activity level and just given the resilience of the us economy i think weve seen a material pickup there proportionally thats broader than other places but we are seeing more activity across europe particularly strategic dialogue id say the one place where things are slower obviously is in asia with respect to china and just given the nature of economic activity there and where things are positioned that still seems slower both on both the ma side and the capital markets side but those are comments id make at a high level gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you always appreciate the insights thank you operator well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning david good morning denis david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to ask a couple of questions about comp leverage and operating margins and maybe just to start off denis you noted the adjusted efficiency ratio sat at versus the reported figure in the mid when we tried to adjust for various items at least in the public disclosure it looks like the core adjusted efficiency is somewhere in the upper and i was hoping you can maybe just help us reconcile some of the different items to get down ph to that figure and whether thats the appropriate jumping off point that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so steven id say i think the is a good jumping off point for and as the business evolves from there as i indicated on a prior question we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the firm certain of our activities attract different degrees of transactionbased and other expenses as we prosecute those activities and so well have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like well have to be mindful obviously what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward into i think on the compensation side of the equation you noticed our disclosure that was roughly flat on a yearoveryear basis our revenues net of pcl in the year were up and our compensation roughly flat we observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of significant execution activity and we want to make sure that were in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see in terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential most of those are pretty the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the oneoff fdic special assessment the one area well continue to manage carefully is on cies as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as weve discussed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and just for a followup relating to the comments you just made denis on comp leverage specifically it looks like the expectation is for revenues to grow about billion this year for the street the comp dollars are expected to increase only about million you do have a good track record of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins i just wanted to get a sense given you were alluding to the fact that youre going to pay for talent and youre going to compensate people appropriately that execute well on the platform how we should be thinking about incremental comp leverage is an comp margin a realistic expectation given where the revenue growth is ultimately going to come from denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc steven ill make a comment if david wants to make another one he can as well were very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform were also focused on driving scale across the platform and meanwhile were staying true to our mantra of pay for performance its what our people expect and its one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients the ultimate compensation payout relative to results in really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reflect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thats it for me thanks for taking my questions denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you operator thank you well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im just wondering what youre going to do about the lead independent director who i guess is no longer on your board bayo i guess his firm got purchased and now you need to get a new lead director is that someone from the board currently someone from outside goldman sachs what type of person is the board looking for david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i appreciate the question mike as you highlight at the end of last week bayo sold his business to blackrock bayo still is the lead director that deal wont close until sometime in the third or fourth quarter bayo is the lead director we have a governance process in place our board has met and at the appropriate time well make an announcement as to the transition but at this point other than the fact that because of the sale it will create a the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 transition i have nothing more to say other than bayo is still the lead director and well manage the transition in an orderly process and no surprises mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so you would consider people outside of goldman sachs currently for that or david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well were always adding people to our board mike but im not going to make
