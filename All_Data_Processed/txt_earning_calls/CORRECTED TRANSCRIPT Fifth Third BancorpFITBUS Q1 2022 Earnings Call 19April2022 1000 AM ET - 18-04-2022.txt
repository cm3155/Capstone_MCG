our reported eps included a negative impact from the visa total return swap and the marktomarket impact of our avidxchange holdings excluding these items adjusted first quarter earnings were per share during the quarter we generated strong loan growth including average ci growth of excluding ppp we grew core deposits once again with strength in consumer transaction deposits of reflecting our success generating quality household growth which increased on a yearoveryear basis we also took advantage of attractive market entry points for deploying our excess cash and grew our securities portfolio by approximately billion on an average basis as a result of our interest earning asset growth net interest income increased sequentially excluding ppp we had yet another quarter of benign credit quality reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting this resulted in near record low chargeoffs of just basis points in addition to our muted credit losses npas remained stable and our commercial criticized assets continued to improve as many of you saw last week i announced my plan to retire as ceo and transition to executive chairman effective july as part of our thorough succession planning process im excited and proud to announce the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 board has unanimously appointed tim spence to succeed me as our next ceo i believe this is the right time for a transition given fifth thirds tremendous financial health and performance shareholders who have followed fifth third for a while know that when i became ceo i made a commitment that we would generate strong financial results and perform well through the various business cycles when we formalized our plans with the project northstar we articulated several key strategic priorities to generate strong and sustainable longterm financial results including optimizing our balance sheet differentiating our customer experience growing and diversifying our fee revenues building on our legacy of digital innovation and maintaining expense discipline i am very proud of what we achieved we transformed our approach to credit risk management centralizing credit underwriting with geographic sector product level concentration limits we exited commercial relationships that had a skewed risk return profile totaling billion focusing on highquality relationships with a more diversified and resilient businesses we deliberately reduced our leverage lending exposure down more than since we remain cautious with respect to our cre portfolio with the lowest cre as a percentage of capital among peers we maintained our expense discipline taking actions when necessary including exiting noncore businesses which allowed us to prioritize our investments in areas of strategic importance we invested heavily in our treasury management systems shifting our focus to building managed service platforms as a result we now have the highest tm fees as a percentage of revenue and commitments and we are the fastest growing among our peers we made significant investments in technology to improve our resiliency and better serve our customers we built a consumer business that has consistently added households far in excess of our peers and the us average while also taking our customers satisfaction scores from below peer medium in to top quartile today we grew market share organically in the southeast and west coast and established a leading position in chicago through the strategic acquisition of mb financial we also invested in strategic nonbank acquisitions like provide dividend coker capital h2c franklin street and more to accelerate growth and broaden our capabilities we structured our securities portfolio to generate stable predictable cash flows that has allowed us to extend our earnings advantage versus peers and we focus on generating sustainable value for all stakeholders including customers employees and communities from day one my focus was to build a franchise that would perform well through the cycle while generating consistent and quality earnings quarter after quarter year after year while some of these decisions impacted nearterm profitability at the time all of these proof points highlight the actions we have taken over the past seven years to improve fifth third and set us up for a long term outperformance through various business cycles furthermore we expect our intentionally assetsensitive balance sheet to perform extremely well relative to peers in this rate environment while the revenue benefits of higher rates are obvious we are mindful that there are likely to be elevated risks in the overall us economy if the fed aggressively tightens monetary policy to curb inflation combined with the existing supply chain constraints and labor shortages however because of our actions and positioning fifth third is as strong as ever and well positioned for longterm outperformance i would just like to say that being the ceo of fifth third has been an honor of a lifetime i am grateful for the support of the board and all of our employees and im incredibly proud of what weve accomplished fifth third is in great shape and tim is well prepared to lead fifth third into the future tim is an outstanding and visionary fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 leader hes been an integral part of fifth thirds leadership team since helping develop strategies and vision that we are executing with excellence through innovation and technology before i hand it over to tim this is my 29th and final quarterly earnings call i can honestly say i have enjoyed almost all of these discussions about our financial performance and outlook with the analyst and investor community i want to say thank you for your confidence that you have given me throughout my tenure i also want to thank our entire leadership team i have been extremely fortunate to work with such a great seasoned team which i believe is the best in the industry what we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable thank you i know that under tims leadership you will continue to do great things inspire others and improve the lives of our customers and the wellbeing of our communities with that let me turn it over to tim timothy n spence president fifth third bancorp good morning to you all thank you greg for the kind words im honored to serve as fifth thirds next ceo and to follow in the footsteps of an incredible leader like you i could not be more excited about fifth thirds future given my role in the company over the past several years and the strength of our performance you should expect continuity in our strategic focus areas and in how we run the bank we will maintain our operational focus expense discipline and culture of accountability to produce consistent financial results while investing for the future we will continue to anticipate and respond proactively to demand shifts and new competitive threats consistent with the actions you have seen us take over the past several years including our deliberate multiyear reduction in punitive consumer fees before it became an industry topic the rollout of our awardwinning momentum banking product suite which is unparalleled among peers our differentiated digitally enabled treasury management services to automate accounts payable and receivable launched well before the pandemic partnerships and acquisitions of fintech platforms like provide and dividend finance that create national scale and a bestinclass customer experience and our focus on financing renewable energy well before esg became a mainstream term more broadly we will remain mindful of the longterm structural shifts taking place such as the evolving geopolitical environment population aging government debt levels and central bank tightening that will create winners and losers over the next decade no one knows for sure what the world will look like years from now but as prudent risk managers we are always contemplating the many potential tail risks as well as positioning the bank to take advantage of potential business opportunities that will arise we will also be steadfast in our belief that we are most successful when we take care of all our stakeholders to that end yesterday we announced that we are increasing our minimum wage to an hour across our footprint and that concurrently we will provide a midyear wage increase to employees in our first four job bands we are taking these actions despite having bestinclass employee retention according to leading research because we recognize that rising costs throughout the economy have a disproportionate impact on our frontline employees who are the face of fifth third in total more than of our workforce will benefit from these increases including of our retail branch and operations employees it is simply the right thing to do in the short term this will result in roughly million in incremental annualized expenses however as we have seen with our two previous wage increases we fully expect to achieve stronger financial outcomes from lower turnover improved workforce quality lower recruiting expenses and more effective training fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 as greg mentioned our balance sheet and earnings power are extremely strong from a capital deployment perspective we will continue to favor organic growth evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities such as provide and dividend finance paying a strong dividend and then share repurchases practically speaking given our robust loan growth we currently anticipate resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter of on behalf of the entire leadership team i would like to say thank you to our employees im very proud that in addition to producing solid financial results we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the wellbeing of our communities i also hope you all feel the same sense of pride that i do in being part of an organization that was just named one of the worlds most ethical companies by ethisphere one of just five banks globally fifth third is a great company because we have great people who live our core values every day with that i will turn it over to jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook james c leonard chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today our first quarter results were solid despite the market volatility during the quarter we generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and grew deposits expenses were once again wellcontrolled but fees underperformed our january expectations due to the market environment improvements in credit quality resulted in an acl ratio of basis points compared to basis points last quarter while an increase in loan balances resulted in a net million increase to our credit reserves combined with another quarter of muted net chargeoffs we had a million total provision for credit losses moving to the income statement net interest income of approximately billion was stable sequentially reported results were impacted by lower day count lower ppp income including a slowdown in forgiveness that resulted in million less in expected ppprelated nii and the expected decline in residential mortgage balances from previous ginnie mae purchases these detriments were offset by the benefit from the deployment of excess liquidity into securities strong loan growth and the impact of higher market rates excluding ppp nii increased sequentially and yearoveryear total reported noninterest income decreased compared to the year ago quarter or on an adjusted basis similar to peers our results were impacted by lower capital markets revenue primarily due to transaction delays as well as lower mortgage revenue in light of lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins partially offset by improving msr asset decay we generated solid yearoveryear fee growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management where we produced net aum inflows again this quarter consumer deposit fees were stable as our success generating household growth offset the continued decline in punitive consumer fees as part of our momentum banking offering noninterest expenses increased just compared to the year ago quarter reflecting continued discipline throughout the company compensation expenses were wellcontrolled with the yearoveryear increase reflecting the previously announced broadbased restricted equity awards which will support the continuation of our strong employee retention fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 we also continue to invest in the ongoing modernization of our tech platforms these items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to 2021s contract renegotiations adjusted expenses increased sequentially driven by the special equity award and the usual seasonal increase in compensation and benefits expense our expenses this quarter included a marktomarket benefit associated with nonqualified deferred compensation plans of million with a corresponding offset in securities losses moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases increased sequentially average total consumer portfolio loans increased compared to the prior quarter as strength in auto originations combined with growth in residential mortgage was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances primarily from greensky balance runoff average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter primarily reflecting growth in ci loans excluding ppp average commercial loans increased with ci loans up commercial loan production remained strong and in line with our original expectations production was strongest in core middle market which was well diversified geographically which increased over yearoveryear our production and pipelines continued to reflect our strategic investments in talent and our successful geographic expansion as we sustained our record pace in adding new quality relationships during the first quarter with muted payoffs and higher revolver utilization rates reflecting the capital markets slowdown periodend commercial loans excluding ppp increased sequentially and compared to the year ago quarter over half of the sequential period end growth was due to existing revolvers with the utilization rate increasing to given the market opportunities in the first quarter we began deploying excess cash to protect against the rising risk of an economic downturn during the first quarter we grew our securities portfolio approximately billion on an average basis securities increased billion or sequentially as we have said over the past two years our balance sheet positioning allowed us to remain patient and not grow the portfolio at historically low interest rates caused by the extraordinary federal reserve intervention the past days have absolutely validated our decision to patiently wait and our actions this quarter and beyond will ensure our strong throughthecycle performance under various rate scenarios over the long term our investments continue to focus on adding duration and structure to the portfolio with stable and predictable cash flows consequently our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increased from to at quarter end average other shortterm investments which includes our interestbearing cash decreased billion reflecting the growth in loans and securities partially offset by continued core deposit growth compared to the yearago quarter average commercial transaction deposits increased and average consumer transaction deposits increased reflecting our continued success growing consumer households we once again added households in every market compared to last year led by our key southeast markets moving to credit as greg mentioned our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with npas at basis points and net chargeoffs at basis points we continue to closely monitor areas where inflation and higher rates may cause stress as greg also mentioned we have deliberately reduced our highly monitored leveraged loan portfolio for this very reason which is now below billion in outstandings while also significantly improving the quality of the portfolio moving to the acl our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our threeyear reasonable and supportable period at around we maintained our scenario weights of to the base and to the upside and downside scenarios our acl build this quarter reflected strong loan growth and a worsening downside economic scenario partially offset by improvements in the credit risk profile of the loan fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 portfolio including a reduction in borrowers in prolonged distress if the acl were based on the downside scenario the acl would be billion higher if the acl were weighted to the baseline scenario the reserve would be million lower while our base case expectations point to continued economic growth there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario including escalating geopolitical tensions which could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains pressures from the feds quantitative tightening or additional covid variants which could play out given the uncertain environment our march allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment moving to capital our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at above our stated target of the decline in capital was primarily due to strong rwa growth in light of the robust organic business opportunities and securities purchases combined with an basis point impact from the cecl capital transition rule we expect to close the acquisition of dividend finance in the second quarter which will deploy approximately basis points of capital our tangible book value per share excluding aoci increased during the quarter and compared to the year ago quarter moving to our current outlook which includes the financial impacts from dividend finance we expect full year average total loan growth between and compared to including the expected headwinds from ppp and the ginnie mae forbearance loans we added last year excluding these items we expect total average loan growth of around reflecting strong pipelines sales force additions the dividend and provide acquisitions and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year this should result in commercial loan growth of to or to excluding ppp we now expect total average consumer loans to be stable in reflecting our first quarter decision to lower auto loan production in order to enhance our returns on capital we now expect around billion in auto and specialty production for the full year which will still result in doubledigit growth in indirect consumer secured balances in our outlook also assumes modest growth in other consumer loans reflecting the benefits of dividend finance partially offset by a decline in greensky loans on a sequential basis we expect second quarter average total loan growth of to comprised of to commercial balance growth and stable consumer balances we expect to average ci growth in the second quarter excluding ppp we expect our average securities portfolio to increase approximately billion in the second quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made later in the first quarter combined with the assumption that we add billion more in balances given the market opportunities we have seen through early april we also assume billion in additional securities growth in both the third and fourth quarter given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of april we now expect full year nii to increase approximately to it is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the runoff of the ppp and ginnie mae portfolios which result in a million headwind this year excluding those portfolios nii growth would exceed our current outlook assumes stable to slight growth in deposit balances in compared to with continued strong growth in consumer deposits in the midsingle digits offset by the expected runoff of non operational commercial deposits we expect deposit betas of around on the first basis points of fed rate hikes the basis points we saw in march combined with another basis points in both may and june fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 while we remain confident in the quality of our deposit base the rapid and aggressive policy response by the fed to curb inflation including the potential for rate hikes from march to march and aggressive fed balance sheet reductions we expect deposit betas of approximately over the first basis points this cycle compared to the mid last cycle the ultimate impact to nii of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements balance sheet management strategies including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas for the second quarter we expect nii to be up to sequentially reflecting strong loan growth the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our assetsensitive balance sheet we expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable to down in compared to our prior expectations of up to this change is primarily driven by the change in our rate outlook the single biggest line contributing to the change is deposit service charges which is reflective of incremental earnings credits in light of the higher interest rate environment the rate environment has also impacted our outlook for mortgage revenue which we now expect to be down or so in compared to we continue to expect strong but slightly lower than january expectations in commercial banking fees and private equity income in provided resolutions of the temporary delays experienced in the first quarter occur it is worth noting that even with the decline in expected fee income primarily due to the interest rate environment we expect total revenue to now be approximately million more than our january guidance we expect second quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up to compared to the first quarter or down around compared to the year ago quarter we expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be stable on a standalone basis or up to including the impact of dividend finance compared to which is an improvement from our previous guidance of up to we continue to strategically invest in our franchise which should result in low doubledigit growth in both technology and marketing expenses our outlook also assumes we add new branches primarily in our high growth southeast markets our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to per hour that tim mentioned we expect these investments in our people platforms and franchise to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives reduced servicing expenses associated with the ginnie mae portfolio a decline in leasing expense given our disposition of lasalle business solutions which was completed in april and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company we expect total adjusted expenses in the second quarter to be down around to compared to the first quarter which is up compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of provide and dividend finance or stable on a standalone basis as a result our full year total adjusted revenue growth is expected to significantly exceed the growth in expenses resulting in nearly points of improvement in the efficiency ratio our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects our recent acquisitions expense discipline and strong balance sheet management it also considers the known revenue headwinds from ppp and our ginnie mae portfolio we continue to expect second quarter and full year net chargeoffs to be in the to basis points range in summary we continue to take actions to further strengthen our balance sheet positioning for this environment we are deploying excess cash prudently into both loans and securities to support continued throughthecycle outperformance and have a lot of momentum in our businesses to have a very successful fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president head of investor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning operator please open the call up for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co and jamie appreciate hey i guess first of all both to greg and tim congratulations to both of you and best wishes greg as you go forward and tim in the new position timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp thank you gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes jamie appreciate all the thoughts on sort of liquidity deployment i guess now that youve deployed sort of a majority of the target roughly billion or so in excess liquidity and the rest will be deployed through the remainder of the year is there in your mind sort of an opportunity to kind of redefine what your excess liquidity looks like in other words deposits arent really coming out of the system at large the way one might have fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 thought earlier is there a point at which you say hey those are going to stick around and theyre sort of a use or will they just be absorbed with loan growth etcetera just maybe any thoughts there james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp its a good question and thanks for asking scott i probably should have included it in my prepared remarks that ive recalibrated our excess liquidity given the first quarters activity to where were sitting on about billion of excess cash here in april i still like the onethird onethird onethird approach where perhaps athird of it runs off in the commercial deposit book as the fed starts to move in basis point increments and then athird in additional security purchases so billion more during the course of this year and then obviously the rest in loan growth especially with dividend coming on board where we expect continued nice loan growth throughout the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then you gave some thoughts on sort of the puts and takes in the expense outlook i guess it was nice to see that you can absorb that minimum wage increase and still improve the expense guidance are there any areas where you guys explicitly dialed back things outside of compensation increase or i guess sort of maybe just a little more thought on the puts and takes as you see them james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah the puts and takes this quarter relative to the january guide really is the interplay of the rate environment between fees and nii whereas expenses the main driver of the improved expense base on a standalone basis is really the fulfillment costs and related compensation related to the lower fees but the rest of the franchise and our approach to managing expenses during the year really hasnt changed from when we started the year we continue to focus on technology investments and supporting our marketing efforts and so the marketing spend is actually a little bit higher as we look out at the year given the strong growth weve had in consumer household acquisitions and the momentum banking product obviously the minimum wage adjustment was a little bit of an uptick in expenses but again offset by some of the savings from the lower fee guide so overall i think the approach remains the same which is continue to invest in the business and continue to let that strong momentum show up in the rest of the balance sheet activities r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co terrific all right good thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is really for greg and tim greg congratulations on your retirement im wondering sort of why you decided now would be a good time to step aside and tim maybe just as a followup to that what are you most excited about as you look forward outside of macro in terms of the growth prospects for the bank that youre inheriting fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp erika this is greg thanks for the question first off i think its really a perfect time for me to be stepping down as ceo the bank is in fantastic shape i became ceo in the objectives we put in place to be good through the cycle make the changes that we need to for outperformance through the cycle i feel really good about so position of the bank our position for the future the success weve had its a great time to step aside second thing is tims readiness tims been with the bank sixplus years its been a succession i think a well thought out succession plan tim is absolutely ready the time is now for him to step up given the performance of the bank and the third thing is my personal aspiration to retire at age which i turned in january and thats always been an aspiration of mine to be able to do that and theres a lot of things i want to focus on a lot less travel on the personal side personal investments and was kind of my timeline also but that would not have worked if tim wasnt ready the bank wasnt positioned as well as it was so it really came together to be the right time timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah and erika as it pertains to your question for me i mean im excited about a lot i think we are in as good a shape as fifth third has been at any point since i have been around the company including the several years that i spent outside the bank as a consultant to the bank and to greg and i think we have assembled a really outstanding bench of leadership talent right we talk a lot about experience being a team sport here so you have deeply experienced folks from inside the company you have folks who have joined from outside the bank who brought in fresh perspectives and have really helped us to think about how we shape the business going forward and if you think about the longterm objective we set for ourselves which is to outperform through the cycle i think all the pieces parts are in place we have a great culture of expense discipline weve inculcated a credit discipline that will support through the cycle performance we have been investing continuously i think sometimes maybe we havent gotten enough credit for it because we have essentially been harvesting expenses in some areas and redeploying them in growth and the byproduct of that is we have a really excellent footprint and a nice balance between the southeast and the midwest and were seeing the bloom coming from many of the investments weve made in digital capabilities i think in particular with the focus on product innovation right whether that is momentum banking and the differentiation that that has provided and supported has provided to our household growth goals or the managed services which as greg mentioned in his prepared remarks it helped to really drive the right balance in fees to total revenue and then i think last but certainly not least the benefits were going to continue to see from the acquisitions of provide and dividend in terms of providing sustainable loan growth with really attractive roas so theres a lot to feel good about here erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and the second question is for jamie jamie afs has become a bad word this quarter and im wondering youve always had a very distinct investment policy if you could explain to the generalists that are listening to this call that have been distressed about the cet1 erosion that theyve seen at the big banks where its been relevant and then the aoci at other regional banks kind of the impact to tangible book what you bought in the quarter to billion and the difference between duration risk for cmbs and rmbs and also if you could translate into generalist language what bullet and locked out structures mean fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i think i could take the next hour of this call if i go through those but just tells you how good a question it is jump in if i dont touch on all aspects of it but i guess i would start with saying and maybe im fighting a losing battle on this one but i do struggle with the concept of fair valuing one line item of the balance sheet but not the rest of it or not evaluating htm in combination with afs because philosophically for me as a category bank our election to put a security into afs or htm doesnt change the economics or the risk of the investment and i understand for the largest banks there is value in minimizing the risk of the regulatory capital volatility but for us well below billion in assets we believe the benefits of maintaining the flexibility to manage the portfolio as the environment unfolds or our outlook changes creates significant value and youve seen that over the last eight years where weve had the number one performing investment portfolio yield in the industry so i struggle with the concept of would our company be worth more if i place the securities into the roach motel of htm or if i maintained my flexibility and my optionality and put it in afs but i understand thats how the valuations work our goal is always to optimize the balance sheet to deliver longterm real economic value and not make decisions that optimize an accounting outcome over economic value so thats why we continue to put all of the securities in afs because we like the optionality in terms of what were buying the second part of your question we do like the bullet and locked out cash flow structure so that theres a minimal extension risk in that security relative to rmbs probably the best example for the generalist on that would be our duration was years at the end of the year and it moved to years at the end of this quarter all of that duration extension was because of the securities that we purchased we averaged yield in 65year duration on what we purchased so all of our duration extension was intentional and we prefer to add duration when we want to add it as opposed to the market forcing that duration extension upon us and thats really the value of the bullet and locked out cash flow sacrifice a little bit of yield in a base environment but i protect the volatility on uprates or down rates and thats really the philosophy of managing the investment portfolio erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo security sic securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just same questions just asked i just want to clarify there so youve deployed what of your excess capital excess cash im sorry and now you have about of the excess cash to deploy from a year james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah yes fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc is that how we should think about this james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i looked at it mike as i add million to million of excess cash i bought million of additional leverage in the quarter we got about million left net of loan growth for second quarter purchases and additional cash deployment as the year progresses and i think to scotts question early on theres an opportunity that perhaps that other billion of runoff in deposits doesnt occur is offset by growth in other areas but for now thats how we see the year playing out mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then to the other question for the ceo change greg you gave a summary of what youve accomplished over the last seven eight years anything that you say if you had more time youd like to have achieved and then tim more like who is tim spence right what is your background maybe greg why did the board select tim what are the unique characteristics for tim to be the steward of fifth thirds shareholders capital for the next several years forward thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp absolutely mike first off we accomplished the objectives that i set out for that we talked about and we put project northstar in place would i like to have done it more faster yes probably but once again the ability of the organization to absorb the amount of change that were bringing forth was important also so i think we did it the right way its not a whole lot i would have changed or done differently so im very proud of what weve accomplished as jamie said and tim said its a team sport and weve got a great organization weve worked harder for the greater organization and a great team around tim why tim right now absolutely the right person tim has a strong technology background hes been instrumental in a lot of acquisitions and the investments that weve made in the space he has great great abilities to look ahead understand and assess the challenges that were going to be faced with not one year two years but five years down the road so when you think about what the bank needs going forward strong technology expertise but also being a visionary and being able to see down the road what the challenges might be that were faced with and also execution tim is fantastic on the execution side you give me the greatest visionary the greatest strategist but if you cant execute youre not going to be successful tim has demonstrated over the years especially as president he can execute extremely extremely well once again if that wasnt the case we wouldnt be making this transition at this time but he is absolutely ready hes the right person for the reasons i just said i couldnt be more excited im a large shareholder im going to be a large shareholder to have tim at the helm going forward and im excited about starting the next phase of my life which is retirement something i worked hard to achieve at an early age and i think its just a great great time for both of us mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay ill requeue i have some more tech questions thanks fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay couple of questions first on the ci i noticed in the deck that exppp you were up qq and i just wanted to see if you could unpack the drivers a little bit one of the reasons is inventory builds going up how much longer can that last ive got a colleague internally who is telling me that inventories are about peaking and im wondering if you agree with that or not and maybe give some sense of what youre seeing in your customers desire for capex and what the runway is on that thanks timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah sure betsy this is tim thanks for the question so look you have to think about our ci business as being the corporate banking business and the middle market business so i think very clearly the corporate banking side of the business the rising utilization there is at least in part a byproduct of the capital markets having been in flux and ideally we anticipate that as the markets open up and the folks that we bank who are issuers on a regular basis go back into them that youll see more fee income and then in turn a little bit less utilization but there is no question of inventory build there in the core middle market i think there is still room to run on inventory build but there is no question that the catalyst for us in terms of our own growth has been now the focus on capex in particular investments that are going to drive labor productivity or at a minimum a reduction in labor requirements and then in addition to that we have benefited now and are continuing to benefit from what was a record pace of adding new quality relationships last year which has carried over into the first quarter jamie and greg and i were laughing before the call its really its the four cs for us its cincinnati chicago the carolinas and california plus tennessee and we couldnt figure out how to get a c out of that one but that drove the outperformance in ci production in the first quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay i guess tennec so maybe its the end of that you could fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah there you go tennec exactly there it goes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then maybe you could help me understand how youre thinking about deposits and deposit movement from here youve got the fed qe but then youve got your highquality book and so how should we be thinking about deposit growth and what the loantodeposit ratio should look like as we progress over the next year or so thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah we certainly expect the loantodeposit ratio to what ill say improve get higher we finished the quarter at and really the interaction between the loantodeposit ratio and the deposit betas is obviously highly correlated and as we entered the last tightening cycle at fifth third we were in the mid so we dont expect to get that high in this over the next couple of years but we certainly would like to manage the company in the from a loantodeposit ratio but it will take a little bit of time to get there i think from a deposit activity standpoint we expect continued strong consumer deposit growth and then were forecasting and perhaps its conservative a runoff in the nonoperational deposits within the commercial book is were just not going to chase ratesensitive nonrelationship deposit balances but with that said i really like the balance sheet that weve put together over the last seven years where weve really improved the primacy within the consumer book as well as the granularity through the household growth along with the improvements in the operational deposits through our strong treasury management business i know weve talked about at different conferences over the course of the year the strength of our tm business but that ultimately will pay off as rates start to rise and we can perhaps manage to a lower beta in the next basis points than what we saw with the start of the hikes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the nonoperational youve sized that james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp im sorry i couldnt hear you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh the nonoperational deposits youve sized that james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning jamie just following up on the securities portfolio purchases now that youve both moved more in and also rates have moved higher i wonder if you could just level set us relative to your comments last quarter about where you think the securities book yields go over the course of the year looks like youre in the mid280ish just type of now can you just give us kind of an updated level set on how that trajects given the better front book yields that youve been able to see james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah so we expect the investment yields to be in the area in the second quarter as well as for the full year which is up obviously from the guide we had in january in the to range ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc perfect great and then second just a question on deepening on the expense side so the expense guide got a little better for the full year even with the incremental minimum wage could you just kind of give us some granularity on what was the rest of the delta was it incentive comp related to fees was it just incremental efficiencies that youve been able to find just details there would be great thank you james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp its predominantly the fulfillment costs within mortgage and incentives in the other businesses that were impacted by the lower fee outlook and then partially offset by the higher marketing expenses and the minimum wage increase impact ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it so everything else related to like branch savings etcetera technology spend is intact underneath the surface james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp correct yeah fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks a lot guys operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess one question just around as we think about capital deployment future ma just talk to us around how and maybe tim if you want to jump in on how you think about adding scale so youre obviously organically growing in the southeast talk to us about like bank ma is there any appetite for that and then how does that fit in when you think about technology and i know tim you spent a lot of time on payment tech strategy so some perspective on how you see fifth thirds position on the tech stack and what are the one or two big sort of areas that youre looking to invest as we think about the next couple of years gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp okay a lot of questions this is greg let me get started here first off when we think about deploying capital we have not changed how we think about it number one is organic growth thats extremely important to us whether the expansion in the southeast on the west coast investing in our people technology products services job one is organic growth building a quality franchise for the future to perform well second we look at nonbank ma transactions so opportunities like provide dividend finance h2c coker franklin will be examples of nonbank opportunities that really add to our products and our service capabilities thats extremely in our reach extremely important to us were always looking for those type of opportunities that make us a better bank and thats number two number three we want obviously we want to continue to pay a strong dividend number four with excess cash will be share repurchases lower in our priorities would be ma now why is ma bank ma lower in the priority list for us quite frankly theres not a lot of opportunities out there and we dont believe ma is a strategy unto itself we think ma is a strategy which will support our strategic direction when you look at some of the transactions that have been done recently we would not participate did not participate in those type of transactions so once again if there was an opportunity from a bank ma perspective they have to fit into our strategic objectives such as being larger and more relevant in the southeast and attractive markets theres just not a lot of those opportunities that exist today thats why its lower in our priority list it doesnt mean that when something did emerge that fits into our strategic direction makes us more relevant in the southeast and the right markets that were looking for is a good cultural fit that we wouldnt consider it well absolutely consider it its just lower on our priority list because theres not a lot of those opportunities out there that really fit what were strategically trying to accomplish and we think are actionable so thats why its lower in the list for us but once again if something emerged we will obviously assess that for longterm shareholder value we will consider it timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 yeah and for what its worth i concur with all that i think weve said for a long time that we dont believe that scale is an end in and of itself and that certainly will be consistent in terms of our point of view on how we proceed as it pertains to your questions about technology you can think about the investments that we have been making in basically three areas one is just the core infrastructure right weve talked a lot about data centers weve talked a lot about the cloud data strategy we talked a lot about information security and otherwise i think we feel very good about where were at on that front we are making good progress i cant remember the cricket analogy so im going to have to go with middle innings but were taking the platform modernization front okay and i think feel very good about the migration away from legacy mainframe platforms and on the platforms that allow us to spend a lot more of our money on new application development as opposed to maintenance and service and then i think the thing thats probably been less that has been underemphasized in our industry in general but which is a big point of focus for ours is we are believers that the more fundamental disruption associated with the internet in all sectors is the way that it informs product and product innovation so that is the area where i think we will continue to look to differentiate we have to be good at all of the other items that are hygiene factors but its the opportunities to leverage technology to change the nature of the value proposition that we have for our customers the way that we did with momentum banking when we launched it a year ago and as we continue to hone and refine and add feature functionality to that platform the things that the folks at provide have done over time that they actually been able to accelerate the amount of innovation that they brought to market we launched five or six new products within the first six months that they were onboard and they had gotten two or three out in the prior few years beforehand and then the managed services which are obviously a critical platform for us and which provide really stable and highmargin fee income ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for that comprehensive response one quick followup jamie sorry if i missed it did you mention what the dollar amount was for the nonoperational deposits james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp we did not but its baked into the billion of outflow that were assuming occurs during the course of the year so sorry i didnt answer that more clearly with betsys question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no understood and greg and tim congratulations thank you timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 good morning can you guys talk about how ci spreads are trending i know a few quarters ago you were talking about pressure but weve seen obviously widening spreads in capital markets which isnt a perfect indicator but certainly better to widen than narrow and on the flip side as rates go up theres obviously more spread to potential play with as you think about competitive forces so maybe what youre seeing now and how you think theyll trend in the next few quarters thank you james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah matt its jamie thanks for the question the ci spreads are definitely stabilized during the course of the first quarter such that the ci yields exppp were only down basis points as opposed to some of the double digit types of declines you saw in other quarters so we feel good about stabilization of loan yields and in fact for the balance sheet hitting an inflection point in the second quarter for pretty much every asset class that yields and spreads should be improving as we go forward from here matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay then as we think about i guess specifically like on the spreads like yields would go up obviously because rates are going up but then a lot of banks are or all banks are trying to grow kind of the core ci which has been a strength of fifth third for years so how do you think some of the spreads trend in the next few quarters between the puts and takes of again capital markets youve seen some spread widening but competitive forces from the banks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think ci spreads in the second quarter stable flat and then improvement perhaps as we get to the back end of the second quarter heading into the second half of the year given some of the disruption in the capital markets and the spread widening from the geopolitical tensions thats how we have it modeled going forward matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning gerard fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc greg and tim congratulations on the new roles for both of you jamie i always appreciate your color commentary about the balance sheet and the asset liability sensitivity as well as the expectations you have for the full year as well as the second quarter and the world has changed dramatically in this first quarter as evidenced by your assumptions on the fed funds rate and the powerful impact that has had on net interest income can you share with us if were here a year from now now granted greg will be drinking a piña colada in the caribbean we know that but for you and i what should we really focus in on a year from now that could be as startling its just breathtaking how its changed and its not just for you folks of course its to everybody but im just taken aback at how strong everyones net interest income growth is now because of the rate environment change and im wondering a year from now what could it be like that could make us stay up late at night worrying james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think a year from now and really the value that we see from our actions this quarter is just how well positioned our balance sheet is to perform well through the cycle both from an nii perspective and a credit perspective and i think perhaps there was some concern would we have waited too long and missed the opportunity and i think the good news from todays release is that we are well positioned and well protected to the possibility of a recession in or not that thats our base case but certainly something that were mindful of and we pride ourselves and really under gregs leadership over the last seven years of being good risk managers and thats how we approach things so that should a downturn occur were well positioned to be a strong performer but should we continue to see good economic growth that this is a company thats positioned to do well with generating high returns high ppnr growth and really do well through the cycle timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp gerard if i were to add one thing i think jamie referenced credit weve come out of a period here where the dynamic around rates has i think really obscured the importance of funding quality and just given the way that reporting gets done its probably hard to tell from the outside looking in how good the funding base is and that doesnt just extend to banks its to nonbanks as well right so as the fed tightens i think theres going to be more differentiation than maybe the market fully appreciates as it relates to the stability and the quality of your funding base and the banks who have done the things that weve tried to do in terms of growing primary relationships and with a focus on core operational deposits should be much better positioned to weather an environment where liquidity maybe is theres a premium attached to it unlike the environment that we really have come out of over the course of the past handful of years gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the color and the prime relationships that youve developed with your customers and the lowcost funding that comes along with that is obviously very beneficial at what point or is there a point that you folks may look for some term funding if rates were to really go higher months from now just like theyve done in these last three or four months does it make sense at some point to start looking at some term funding james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes and that is included in our nii guide as well for the year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you jamie operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the deposit beta topic i just wanted to see if you could perhaps discuss any of the risks or concerns that investors have that betas for the industry could surprise higher than many of the banks are expecting i know you guys are expecting a lower beta perhaps in the range versus you experienced in the previous cycle can you just talk about the concerns there that competition could be much more intense this time around given the various players in the space that could perhaps influence deposit betas to be higher than expected james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah john thanks for the question there are a lot of competing factors on where the betas shake out we think the overwhelming factor for the industry is the amount of liquidity is signified by the loantodeposit ratio and the industry being better than they were at the end of heading into the last cycle but youre certainly right the level of competition ultimately dictates the deposit betas we just think the industry is so much better positioned now that the level of that competition should be less so from an industry perspective we think that should win out but then if were wrong then lets talk about it on an idiosyncratic basis for fifth third what we have been able to accomplish with the primacy and operational deposits and the treasury management business has translated for us what we believe should be a lower beta on the first at the last time this time but with that said days ago we were modeling a beta on those first so we have raised our own expectations a bit hopefully we will do better than that but on the possibility that we would not a beta is what weve settled in in our outlook in the up when you break it down by customer segment obviously the wealth and asset management area is a highly pricesensitive portfolio whereas for us the improvement wont be as much in that portfolio as it is in the commercial business because of the treasury management and then in the retail book the value exchange with the free services that you receive in momentum banking we believe should result in a little bit lower beta this time around so that were not competing on rate for the retail customer but rather the value exchange with those other services including things like less punitive fees the nsf elimination and all of the other structural changes we made to our product lineup should result in a better beta this cycle but if by chance were wrong i think were wellpositioned to be able to compete well regardless of how that plays out john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks jamie thats helpful and then a similar question actually on the credit side i know youre not flagging anything too concerning on the credit front and thats very similar to the message that weve gotten out of the banks this earnings season and but i know you saw a bit of a tick up in your to days past dues and a couple of other banks have seen it as well what areas of credit are you watching most closely what fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 areas do you think will move first and are there any signs of faster than expected normalization at all within your consumer portfolio for example richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah hey its richard let me start with the last one from a consumer standpoint were actually not seeing signs of acceleration if you think about where the excess liquidity went certainly to the top of that went to the top of income households that liquidity has been sticking around for our customer base and again were prime and super prime and activity really has we really havent seen a shift in activity with respect to behavior changes in terms of excess liquidity running off faster than we expected in fact its running off a little slower than we expected as people continue to strike the right balance across their lifestyles from a delinquency standpoint were at such a low level and the delinquency change for us was really in commercial were at such a low level but it just takes one or two to slip over the quarter to change the percentages so were really not seeing any trends in terms of that would be alarming that points us to an acceleration of the normalization across credit whether its consumer or commercial i think areas were watching clearly we continue to watch the leverage space particularly enterprise value lending thats an area that weve been very disciplined on and were happy with the portfolio but thats a place where we continue to exercise discipline theres a handful of segments in cre office is one that were watching longterm just given the structural changes in that space but we focus on quality class a properties gateway cities its all very good stuff and then theres then were watching consumer products and manufacturing and senior living and a couple more places where that were watching is places where the ability to pass through cost increase may be a little harder we havent seen evidence of that at least at this point most people have been able to pass cost increases through but thats where were watching john pancari q analyst evercore isi very helpful thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of trevor sic terry mcevoy with stephens your line is now open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc ill take that good morning jamie maybe a question for you could you just remind us what the mix is within commercial banking revenue it was down but better than some of the others who maybe call it capital markets or investment banking and then maybe what are pipelines like today and do you have any nearterm thoughts on that business james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah the disruption in the first quarter definitely impacted the debt capital markets groups with the loan syndications and the corporate bond fees for us within the commercial banking its a pretty good split between frm products where were helping customers with hedging call that a third of the business a little bit more than fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 that amount in investment banking revenue and then the remainder within some of the lending fee categories that then aggregate to the total so what weve seen is that frm has done better than we originally expected but that investment banking category within corporate bond and loan syndication and bridge fees performed worse than expectations so thats the mix there the guide for the year includes some assumption that markets stabilize and reopen and should that not happen then we would just have more of the interplay between nii and fees so that at the end of the day we still feel good about the revenue generation of the company terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just as a followup the average commercial loan growth of to versus to in january is that all layering in dividend finance or ex that deal you see a stronger yield within commercial lending james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah so dividend finance will show up in other consumer loans unlike provide that did show up in ci so youll see provides benefit is in the ci guide and dividend finance is in the other consumer loans category terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay great thanks for clearing that up and then congrats to both greg and tim thank you for taking my questions gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp thank you terry operator your next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning jamie i wanted to ask about the fed balance sheet and if it contracts does that make a difference to your rate outlook andor kind of how you perceive the back row picture james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp we do expect contraction with our outlook of the fed balance sheet as they potentially begin to sell down in june announce it in may i guess ultimately the variable to our outlook would be if they were to move significantly faster than perhaps you have a little bit more deposit outflow or higher deposit betas than whats expected but it fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 would have to be pretty quick and significant action on their part to implement the quantitative tightening more so than what weve got baked in so i think ultimately it will play out okay christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay but youre not expecting the opposite where they dont contract at all thats not part of the equation james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp correct yes christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay very well thanks operator your next question again comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well since greg you defined tim starting with the word tech or technology maybe just dig into a little bit more tim your vision or what does the bank of the future look like in terms of technology greg you certainly have taken fifth third away but theres still a lot more to go im sure so ill give you column a or column b column a would be more onpremise proprietary inhouse dont rely too much on third parties and you can control your destiny and that column a is where certain banks are where they want to protect a lot of their customer data and information safety and security column b would be zero ops public cloud maybe fintech partners in the type of lego approach where you piece those together really making use of having kind of break down the borders around the bank so column a or column b or maybe im framing this wrong and you can give another answer but how do you foresee the tech bank of the future gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp tim is going to answer door c here timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp no look mike i think its a mix of both the nice thing about our sector is there really is a very active technology vendor community and it gives you a lot of choices about how you want to run the business i dont think were ever going to be all in bucket a or bucket b were big believers that where there is an industry utility that drives very limited customer differentiation and where theres a benefit to shared scale it makes sense to ride on the rails that are available and where theres an opportunity to differentiate andor an aspect of the business thats deeply proprietary that its got to be managed and maintained inhouse fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 so i think youre going to see us take a best of blend approach as it relates to those two areas but with a heavy focus on owning the tech platforms and the products which are customerfacing and probably comparatively a lighter emphasis on that as it relates to the back office where youre talking about a scaled utility thats processing credits and debits as opposed to something thats more strategic or proprietary to the business mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay that was clear but any more concrete metrics that you can give us not everyone discloses this but the number of apps that you have and how much youd like to reduce that or the number of vendors you have and where youd like that to go or the percent that youre in the public cloud and where youd like to take that or the number of data centers where the end state is what you desire just anything concrete those of us on the outside could maybe ask you again in a couple of years to track your progress gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey mike this is greg i dont have concrete numbers for you but when you think about things like data centers its two obviously we want to be down to two data centers and were approaching that pretty quickly here obviously we want to make sure we have a hot sight and you get latency on how fast things can travel to us because we have to be mindful of that but thats going to be the case when you think about our core apps to run the business something less than we have today im not sure how substantial it will be at the end of the day but something less than we have today customerfacing apps as you think about that where we can build off of common platforms and expand off common platforms very different than the past use an open source cloudbased computing that technology enables us to do things a little bit differently we have less applications so less applications on the customer facing side of the house somewhat less applications on the back end as we consolidate some of our platforms and vendors and definitely less vendors and in data centers were going to two timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah mike the metric that i think im really the metrics where im really chiefly focused on have to do with resiliency of our environment we have talked a lot about that and then they have to do with the mix of spend and the sort of continued focus on driving a heavier share of our overall spend to new application development and products and out of legacy maintenance costs right those i think are the things coupled then with what you can see publicly in terms of the way that customers evaluate our digital channels in terms of the differentiation that you can see in the quality in the products and the services are going to be the things that you should hold us accountable to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc last one so run the bank change the bank spend for technology where has it been where is it today and where might that go to then timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 yeah you include information security and otherwise its been call it change the bank run the bank the goal going forward is to invert that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you very much gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you just had a followup and i apologize if you guys addressed this in your opening remarks but tim you mentioned the four cs of your markets plus tennessee can you share with us where youre seeing the best commercial loan growth within the portfolio are they coming from what parts of the four cs timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah as in which industry sectors gerard or where geographically within the markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc more geographic tim yeah timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah sure so betsy did correct me it is the five cs if you count the see at the end of tennessee as one and i got an angry text message from our head of indiana who pointed out that they had a pretty good quarter as well so yeah look i think geographically we have the benefit of having a really strong presence in midsized metro areas and if you look at both demographics and economic activity thats where the majority of growth is coming from across the us right now it isnt necessarily the mega cities and its certainly not the rural areas its the charlottes the raleighs the cincinnatis the indianapolises the columbuses the inland empire in california is a point of example there as well where youre seeing a lot of the activity and that is very consistent with what you would see inside our book of business as well so the cincinnaticolumbus corridor i think has been a very strong and resilient corridor that should be even better as intel lands here and we get the downstream component suppliers and logistics companies and software engineering companies and otherwise that make their way into the space indianapolis and columbus i think are the two bright stars in terms of economic growth in the midwest and obviously what we are getting out of the upstate and charlotte and raleigh has been really outstanding along with middle tennessee and nashville as opposed to other parts of the state that are growing at a less robust pace fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and as a followup tim in the commercial lending areas how important are the treasury management products to complement the actual loan growth obviously we know lending standards can easily drive loan growth if you lower them but can you share with us that color as well timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah no i mean theyre extremely important and they have been a big catalyst for the success weve had in growing our quality relationship count gerard so a third to of our new relationships have been led by tm in terms of the initial product sale which certainly is anomalous to what i had experienced prior to our having had the success that weve had as it relates to managed services and if you look at the available industry research the folks that do benchmarking on this front fifth third is always in the very top of the top quartile in terms of tm penetration in the middle market and to our middle market lending relationships which i think you can kind of evaluate just by looking at the growth of commercial deposit fees over time and commercial deposits as a percentage of commercial total loan commitments both of which fifth third is bestinclass relative to its investor peer group so its important strategically in terms of how we go to market and the results are bearing out in terms of the financial performance gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to you chris doll chris doll senior vice president head of investor relations fifth third bancorp thank you emma and thank you all for your interest in fifth third please contact the ir department if you have any questions operator this concludes todays conference
