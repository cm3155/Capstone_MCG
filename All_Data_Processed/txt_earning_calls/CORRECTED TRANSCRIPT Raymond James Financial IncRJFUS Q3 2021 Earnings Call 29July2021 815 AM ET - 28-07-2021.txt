consider the risks described in our most recent we basically said that we have sufficient cash on hand to fund the acquisition the regulatory filing also discusses a loan note offering that would be possible thats fairly common in the uk as discussed in the filing it has a nominal interest rate of about basis points which can change over time with shortterm rates but obviously with the overall cash or overall consideration of less than million we have billion almost of cash at the parent company as we discussed earlier on in the call we have a billion target so we have sufficient cash at the parent company to fund the acquisition without kind of any capital actions beyond that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator thank you very much well get to our next question on the line from the line of bill katz with citigroup please go ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking the questions so i guess maybe start with paul as you think about maybe both you guys just in terms of getting to that tier leverage ratio how does this acquisition sort of fit in against that and maybe stepping away from that as you sort of commented on the primary focus area is growth should we assume that the bank growth will be the primary driver to driving down that tier leverage ratio over time thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think youre going to see it in all sorts of ways that you saw the announcement today we are looking at other opportunities to expand the business and again we can never predict these so many of these weve known people for years before theyre interested in selling so our strategic ma has really sharpened and our opportunity is to really sharpen i dont know if deals will happen again but if we can find opportunities that expand our business weve said thats our priority we also plan to grow the bank to the extent we can within that and weve used share repurchases when we cant so i think were still going to focus on opportunities to grow our business which includes strategic ma and also continue to grow the bank and the level of the bank growth than our aggressiveness probably depends first on economic opportunities but also how much capital were able to deploy through other opportunities so well balance that out william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just a followup question i was wondering if you could unpack paul your comments on the nim about sort of maybe a little bit under the over next couple of quarters and maybe on the sweep side where you sort of called out sort of second half of next year can you maybe ringfence like what might be expiring or coming up for contract renewal as we sort of think about the timing next year thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah bill were kind of just essentially reaffirming our guidance on the nim at right around that we provided last quarter so over the next quarter or two obviously depends somewhat on asset mix and the growth of the agency mbs portfolio which weve essentially decelerated over the last quarter just given where rates are we would expect to come in right around that give or take a couple basis points over the next quarter or two as far as the yield on the bdp balances with thirdparty banks a significant portion of our deposits mature contractually over the next i would say to months right now the sort of market rate for new deposits if you can even get capacity as much lower than the basis points or to basis points that were currently earning on average but remember if the yield on those deposits arent attractive with those thirdparty banks we have the capital flexibility going back to pauls comments earlier to bring those cash balances on the balance sheet and invest in other assets so i dont think its as easy as a formula of just assuming that those balances reset at a lower yield off balance sheet because depending on what ph we can or an off balance sheet it may be more compelling to bring it on balance sheet and invest in other assets at the bank securities andor loans william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you both operator thank you very much operator instructions and well get to our next question on the line from steven chubak from wolfe research go right ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i had a followup to bills earlier question you cited the continued pressure on the bank nim consistent with the trend weve seen in recent quarters just given a very strong loan growth particularly in the sbl channel and already low securities yields i was hoping paul that you could unpack whats the primary driver of the nim compression from here and relating to the thirdparty sweeps whats the breakeven level or spread where you might look to sweep thirdparty cash more aggressively to the bank as you face that repricing or that pricing headwind in the back half of next year paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i would tell you steve that the primary driver of the nim compression because most of the shortterm rates are reflected in sort of the yields of the various asset categories most of our asset categories are floating in nature so they reflect the kind of rate environment that were in so most of the nim dynamic going forward is really going to be driven by asset mix so for example this quarter we grew securitiesbased loans on a net basis million which was truly fantastic growth sequentially over yearoveryear and those are fully secured with marketable securities and help strengthen the relationships between advisors and their clients in the private client group so we love that asset raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 but that yield is on average in the quarter whereas the corporate loans are in the to and they have been growing we can resume growth there but not to the same extent as sbl so just by the change in mix to sort of the lower risk categories like securitiesbased loans thats going to put downward pressure on your nim all else being equal as far as the breakeven analysis i wish it was that simple theres a lot of variables that go into that to bring it on balance sheet obviously uses capital and then you have to essentially take either duration andor credit risk to earn a higher yield and that higher yield changes week to week depending on the latest fed announcement so one thing is certain if we dont have the capacity off balance sheet or the capacity is at very low rates then the bringing it on balance sheet certainly looks more attractive on a relative basis and thats something that we have the capital and the appetite to do if necessary steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood okay and then for my followup paul just on some of the noncomp commentary that you provided you noted that noncomp expenses should grow as te picks up ultimately a good problem to have if i look at the noncomps this quarter and i back out the noncontrolling interest piece the reserve release the clean number is about million its slightly above that billion annualized run rate you had spoken to in the past just given some of the drivers of noncomp growth you cited how should we be thinking about the pace of growth from here and maybe what can you give us an updated run rate or jumpingoff point as we think about the noncomp trajectory for the next couple of quarters paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah steve unfortunately still a lot of uncertainty there business development being one prime example of that i would say the billion jumpingoff rate i want to say that our quarterly revenues at that time were somewhere around billion to billion i dont remember exactly when that was but were at billion now so just the business is a lot bigger now and theres a lot of expenses directly associated with the size of our business whether it be subadvisory fees that support the asset management business whether it be fdic insurance expense which supports the bank branches branch expense as we continue to recruit more advisors weve done a couple acquisitions we just announced another one so a lot has changed since we provided that billion metric which begs the question when are we going to provide more new guidance and a new threshold and i would say we want to do that as soon as theres more clarity kind of on the goforward path particularly for things like business development expense in fiscal before the pandemic that was running at around million for the year million a quarter so even this quarters number of million is well below that as an example and then loan loss provisions as well obviously that is something thats going to be volatile until theres more kind of economic certainty or clarity going forward so as soon as there is more certainty around what these expenses will look like we will certainly be transparent as we always are and try to provide you better guidance steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks is it okay if i squeeze in one more i just wanted to get a view on the organic growth sustainability obviously the that you cited is just a very impressive statistic it looks like both you and your peers are raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 running well above longterm averages i was hoping if you could just speak to the sustainability of the organic growth as well as what youre seeing across all the different affiliation options paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so part of that depends the markets been robust and people have been growing and client engagements have been really good so that can all change with a downturn where clients get fearful and assets often dont grow the same in those environments but if you look at any outlook we see in the short to midterm it all looks still very very positive again as i said im here at a meeting with our advisors and theyre all very positive experiencing our top advisors not just record growth in their businesses but i can tell you by the questions over two days and watching what theyre doing with their practices they have no thoughts of slowing down either so again short to midterm i think its sustainable the recruiting has been good across all the options which is ironic too sometimes we got slowed down a little bit a few quarters ago when the private client when their employee channel the offices were closed and we were adjusting but thats really taken off and its going to hit a record probably its on a pace to hit a record this year even after that very slow start so were seeing it all across the affiliation options the pipeline is very strong and so id say for the short to midterm it looks very very good longer term it depends on the economic viability the numbers for the economy growth were good this quarter and in fact continues and people stay positive i think it can continue for a while steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color paul thanks so much for taking my questions operator thank you very much well proceed to our next question on the line from gerry ohara with jefferies go right ahead gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for taking my questions this morning perhaps just kind of just stepping back a little bit as it relates to the acquisition could you give us a little bit more sense as to your ex us kind of i suppose ma strategy and where you think maybe some of the markets that youre most underpenetrated in or perhaps where your offerings specifically would resonate best thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so the focus it depends on the business unit the focus on the private client group has been in the us canada and the uk we have unique offerings i think more or less in all those markets with the multiaffiliation options again unique in canada and in the uk so charles stanley was a perfect fit because there werent many people with not just the cultural heritage but the multichannel options so we are focused on the private client group of any type of opportunity in those three markets were not really looking to expand in other markets in the private wealth business right now and we just want to focus on growing and competing well in those three markets its broader in the ma category its the one raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 business that we do look at global opportunities both from a capital deployment i mean the capital for most ph places is just an office and people versus capital is heavier in the other businesses and it is a global business so we will continue to look for opportunities but again weve been focused in north america the uk and europe but we have looked at things in other places and then the rest of the businesses have to continue to be kind of north american and uk focused so were not we dont we have plenty of capital to grow we think were in strong positions in the uk we had a very good practice but it was small and we think this acquisition would put us in a very competitive position where we can we think accelerate the growth so thats been our focus and continues to be our focus and were not looking at other kind of global markets gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc okay thats helpful and then perhaps one for paul shoukry and forgive me as im still new to this story but i think you cited around the tax rate into fiscal assuming a flat equity market can you perhaps just remind me a little bit about what some of the puts and takes that could kind of move that rate higher or lower as depending on i suppose the backdrop thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah and welcome to the story glad to have you part of the coverage universe yeah one of the biggest drivers and we can get into more detail offline that impacts the tax rate quarter to quarter is we have a corporate owned life insurance portfolio which we use to sort of fund some of our nonqualified benefits that we offer our associates and so the way that corporateowned life insurance portfolio those balances work is that when the equity market appreciates that typically results into nontaxable gains in that portfolio which means that our effective tax rate all else being equal is lower and vice versa when the equity market goes in the other direction it results in non deductible losses which means our effective tax rate all else being equal goes higher so typically the trend is when the equity markets are up our effective tax rate is lower and vice versa again theres a lot of other factors but that is the factor that seems to be the most sort of volatile or impactful from quarter to quarter gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc okay helpful thanks for taking my questions this morning operator thank you very much well get to our next question on the line from devin ryan with jmp securities go right ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey good morning everyone how are you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey sorry i hopped on a minute late here so apologies if im being a bit redundant but on the recruiting outlook appreciate that it remains robust but weve been hearing in the market that on the employee side theres been kind of another maybe ratcheting up of competition packages are you guys seeing that and i know you had spoken about a few quarters ago kind of increases and then you took your offer up so im curious like are we hitting another level where competition is intensifying even more so we may see more pricing pressure or just higher packages just kind of curious what youre seeing in the market there paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i cant really say that i think that weve been so active in recruiting that ph we pretty get a good feel what everyones doing so we said a few quarters ago that where people have been ramping up for a year and we had to make some adjustments but i cant its competitive there are always it seems like an outlier offer this always seems to be an outlying offer here or there every time we recruit but again its not how we recruit we give a competitive package but often not the highest and stick to it and again the results have been tremendous so i cant say its picked up a while ago and i cant say ive seen any difference in the last couple quarters devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific and then just a followup on acquisitions i know a fair amount of color here this morning but as you think about some of the other types of acquisitions in wealth management that maybe arent as traditional of just buying a financial advisor franchise are there other areas that could be interesting that you guys are looking at whether it be technology that accelerates growth in a new way or additional product capabilities are there other types of things that you guys are looking at that i know are maybe a bit nontraditional for raymond james but just kind of also strategically aligned with the ma opportunity it feels like theres maybe even more to do than historically there has been some im curious what you guys are seeing on that front as well paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say devin there is absolutely were looking at a lot of things and one of the categories is firms that offer new services or products that are extensions of what were doing in ph wpfs its probably an example of that but also looking at technology firms that utilize technologies that really kind of propel the businesses were in and weve been very active in that too so it takes a lot of time because you have to find them and then really understand how that technology works and fits and how it will really benefit our businesses whether it be complementary or maybe great to find something in that automated or revolutionized part of the business but those are harder to find but were looking a lot at what i call technology backed or technology firms in our spaces that we think we could utilize the technology to be a strategic client advantage and to make us more efficient and more electronic so the answer is yes weve been looking very hard at a number of opportunities and again weve been on the ma focus much more focused over the last year to two on those types of opportunities raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great and if i can just squeeze one more in here on the fixed income brokerage business in the capital markets segment obviously its been a very good environment for that business is there any way to give us any more context around kind of the growth of that franchise so revenues have been expanding a very good fiscal good start to fiscal and i think we get questions around the sustainability or kind of what normalized looks like and i know thats not necessarily easy to answer but is there any frameworks around kind of how that business has scaled so the pie is expanding or the bar has moved higher because its just a bigger business say than it was two or three years ago paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc ph yeah certainly it has been a unusual environment where both fixed income and equities have produced records so thats youve been going back in history you cant find many windows like that but theyve expanded both in products in the debt capital markets business over the last two years and other areas and we still continue to look in areas of fixed income and our sales and trading business where we have strong client bases but not offering certain products and services and i really dont want to go into what those are but we continue to look and round those out and thats been part of the growth too besides the robust markets and they didnt have a record quarter but they had a very strong quarter in chasing when youre chasing records all the time you dont always set a record but were really pleased with what theyve done and the franchise has continued to grow and prosper so yeah we think in all of our businesses there are investment opportunities and some are harder to find than others but we continue to look and i think there is room to grow devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah okay terrific thanks very much operator thank you and well proceed with our final question for today it is another followup question from the line of bill katz from citigroup please go right ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you so much for taking the extra question just circling back to the investment bank so momentum seems very strong i think your commentary qualitatively around the outlook also is very strong can you unpack that a little bit more just in terms of just like the environment versus some of the added capabilities that youve had also i think at your investor day recently you mentioned sort of getting to an aspirational goal of billion sort of the equity centric side seems like you might already be there just given the pacing here but how to think about maybe the incremental opportunity from here versus maybe some of the cyclical benefit were getting from the robust market backdrop thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so its been a very strong market certainly both for us and our competitors and the environment of low debt costs and high ph eps multiples and a lot of privately held firms or invested firms that and their portfolios that trade so the backdrops been very very strong but in addition to that as jim bunn said well raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29jul2021 were doing well when the markets well and i said youre not giving yourself enough credit for positioning for that growth so not only has he been great at recruiting and building the teams but we continue to do that so you see financo which just joined us which has already scored a few deals of good size in a very short period of time with us and so theyre not their run rate is really not online were very excited about cebile and think thats a great growth business and there are a few other verticals that we are not well positioned and that were looking to do the same things and so its partly a market story but giving that team credit its also been a market positioning and share game which they have made and some could argue were undersized ph or sized and that may be true but theyre certainly building and doing a great job and i think continue to plan to do that the markets just been a big added bonus to their plan william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for the extra time paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay thank you okay and then operator thank you very much actually we have no further questions on the line mr reilly i will turn it back to you for those closing remarks paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc great so thank you all for joining us obviously a strong quarter good markets and i think given if theres not any shocks to the system we feel good about this quarter and well give you more information as we can on charles stanley but again very strict antitakeover provision rules and disclosures in public companies in the uk so once we can and we will give you more information but were very excited about the opportunity thanks for joining us and well talk to you soon operator thank you very much and that does conclude the conference call for today we thank you for your participation
