let me turn it over to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you ilene and good morning everyone earlier today we released our second quarter financial results relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter market conditions in were more subdued and global financial market performance was varied global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets but weakness in emerging markets fixed income markets fell as investors had to contend with still elevated levels of inflation and further central bank rate hikes including the fed reserve raising interest rates above for the first time since the second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business turning to slide of our investor presentation i will review our second quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail beginning with our financial performance second quarter roe was and pretax margin expanded by percentage points yearoveryear to relative to the yearago period eps increased by to supported by our common share repurchases significantly higher nii strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue our results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial us financial institution as well as an accounting adoption taken together these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other feebased businesses and the impact of higherthandesired yearoveryear expense growth turning to our business momentum in q1 i highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities we had line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year we began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded trillion of auca during the second quarter primarily driven by state street alpha underscoring the power of the alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and longterm growth as a result our auca installation backlog declined to trillion while total auca increased by quarter overquarter to trillion both at quarter end in part as a result of this new business we also recorded over billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter largely driven by strong sales in the desirable asset owner official institutions and alternatives client segments our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial onboardings in the coming quarters we continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients front middle and back office activities as demonstrated by the expansion of alphas capabilities to etfs which we announced in for the past years state street has continuously innovated to support what has become a trillion etf market today state street is the largest etf administrator in the world with more than etfs serviced in countries that long cycle of innovation continues as state street alpha now supports the entire etf life cycle by integrating crds front office products with state streets industryleading etf servicing capabilities alpha now provides a centralized platform for etf issuers across the entire etf life cycle including portfolio state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 management trading and compliance to enable a growth across a variety of etf strategies and increased speed to market turning to front office software and data business our overall crd pipeline is strong in the second quarter we converted a meaningful number of onprem crd clients to recurring saas revenue which when coupled with new saas client implementations increased annual recurring revenue by relative to the yearago period in addition charles river wealth management solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in onprem revenues this quarter yeartodate crds wealthdriven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of and we remain on track to grow crds wealth revenue this year the state street global advisors quarterend assets under management totaled trillion supported by higher period end market levels and billion of net inflows from all three business lines etf cash and institutional our spdr etf business gathered billion of net inflows in the second quarter including billion of net inflows into spy the industrys largest etf we also delivered a solid performance in our us lowcost etf segment which gathered billion of net inflows in the quarter continuing to gain market share our cash business gathered a solid billion of net inflows in the second quarter as our us government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher rate environment turning to our financial condition state streets balance sheet liquidity and capital positions remain strong our cet1 ratio was a strong at quarter end well above our regulatory minimum the ongoing capital generation of our business coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders in we returned approximately billion of capital buying back more than billion of our common shares and declaring over million of common stock dividends this means that cumulatively over the last three quarters to the end of june we have returned approximately billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends the strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the fed reserves annual ccar stress test results in june following which we announced our intention for the third year in a row to increase state streets common stock dividend by in the third quarter subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization for up to billion in subject to market conditions and other factors to conclude financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth there was weakness in emerging markets and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further central bank rate hikes on fixed income markets meanwhile both equity and currency volatility continued to decline despite this varied backdrop we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog further developing our alpha capabilities continuing to record new asset servicing wins driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows to global advisors and while we reached doubledigit yearoveryear eps growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest rate environment our results were below our potential state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 first while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter especially as nii we need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter especially as nii is no longer a tailwind and second we are highly focused on controlling our expense base we have a wellestablished track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth we plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders now let me hand the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone ill begin my review of our second quarter results on slide we reported eps of for the quarter an increase of relative to the second quarter a year ago as you can see on the left panel of the slide revenue grew by yearonyear driven by the expansion in our front office solutions area where we are an industry leader continued momentum in the securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income this growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop we also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments which simplifies our reporting going forward while our overall yearonyear fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a stepup in the sales pipeline which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which ill discuss later in todays presentation as we drive growth we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists turning now to slide we saw periodend auca increased by on a yearonyear basis and sequentially yearonyear the increase in auca was largely driven by higher periodend equity market levels and client net inflows quarteronquarter auca increased as a result of the significant trilliondollar alpha installation and a higher periodend market levels at global advisors we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter periodend aum increased year onyear and sequentially the yearonyear increase in aum was largely driven by higher periodend market levels quarteronquarter the increase in aum was also due to higher periodend market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows turning to slide on the left side of the page youll see second quarter total servicing fees down yearon year as net new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activity and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds positive yearonyear equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed income markets sequentially total servicing fees were up primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net new business slightly offset by betterthanusual pricing headwinds this quarter state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 we had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of trillion of auca related to an alpha client in the asset manager sic managers client segment which comes at a modest fee rate but with services that are expected to be added in the coming years within servicing fees backoffice servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors i just described middle office services performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter on a yearonyear basis fees were up primarily reflecting net new business and up sequentially largely driven by the installation that i just mentioned on the bottom panel of this page weve again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter while total auca wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments including mandates in asset owners official institutions and alternatives which are key growth areas for us as weve previously mentioned the wins including those in the alternatives segment which are more complex to service come with aboveaverage fee rates we have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter turning to slide second quarter management fees were million down yearonyear primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods a shift of certain management fees into nii as previously described and some pricing headwinds partially offset by higher average market levels quarteronquarter management fees were up as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows as you can see on the bottom right of the slide our investment management franchise remains wellpositioned with very strong and broadbased business momentum across each of our three lines of business in etfs we saw very strong net inflows of billion into spy and our sectors suite of etfs as well as our spdr portfolio lowcost suite in our institutional business we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our wellestablished indexed fixed income and defined contribution franchises across our cash franchise we continue to see strong demand for our money market funds we recorded net inflows of billion turning to slide relative to the period a year ago second quarter fx trading services revenue was down yearonyear and sequentially primarily reflecting lower client fx volumes and lower industry fx volatility relative to the period a year ago both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of the war in europe last year caused unusually high fx trading activity in the first half of many clients were also riskoff during the debt ceiling discussions in april and may with a rebound in june in client volumes following its resolution altogether was muted we are optimistic about but its hard to predict securities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up yearonyear driven by higher agency spreads sequentially revenues were up again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and specials activity partially offset by lower balances moving on to software and processing fees second quarter software and processing fees were up yearon year and sequentially primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with crd which i will turn to shortly lending fees for the quarter were down yearonyear primarily due to changes in product mix but up sequentially mainly driven by strong client demand for lines of credit state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 finally other fee revenue increased million yearonyear primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative marketrelated adjustments this includes the impact of the new accounting adoption moving to slide youll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased yearon year primarily as a result of higher onpremise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implement more clients over to our saas environment about of our clients are now on our saas platform sequentially front office software and data revenue was up nearly about twothirds of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our charles river development front office solutions products turning to some of the other alpha business metrics in the right panel we were pleased we had three more alpha mandates go live which brings our total live alpha clients to and as i previously mentioned we installed a significant portion of assets related to alpha this quarter we expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future helping us increase the share of our clients wallet now turning to slide second quarter nii increased yearonyear but declined sequentially to million the yearonyear increase was largely due to higher shortterm rates an increase in longterm rates and proactive balance sheet positioning partially offset by lower average deposits sequentially the decline in nii performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of noninterestbearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the us back book partially offset by higher shortterm market rates from international central bank hikes on the right side of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter average deposits declined quarteronquarter in line with industry total deposit trends which also fell by in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately our global floating rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through we now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve as we see good entry points which could enhance nii over time sequentially us dollar client deposit betas were during the second quarter leading again to some sequential nii compression we are now at the point in the us rate cycle where we expect to adjust back book pricing to accommodate our larger clients but do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion of balance and trade for fee opportunities foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the to range weve also included a new slide in the appendix page that shows our nii trends over the past few rate cycles i think it will be it will put the larger nii increases and decreases in context which are driven by many factors including changes in interest rates the pacing of hikes deposit levels and mix fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets you can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of nii and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of nii that is inherent in our business activities state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 turning to slide second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased yearonyear sequentially excluding seasonal expenses second quarter expenses increased just over as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company including alpha private markets technology and operations automation on a linebyline basis yearonyear compensation employee benefits increased primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher head count attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas technology staff insourcing and some lower attrition lowerthanexpected attrition rates sequentially however we have managed head count to be flat information systems and communications expenses increased mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts insourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiatives transaction processing decreased mainly reflecting lower subcustody costs from vendor credits occupancy increased as we relocated our headquarters building temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up mainly reflecting higher professional fees moving to slide on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide as you can see we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels which remain well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of was down basis points quarteronquarter largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher rwa partially offset by retained earnings our lcr for state street corporation was flat quarteronquarter at and decreased percentage points quarteronquarter but still quite high at for state street bank and trust were also very happy with our performance in this years ccar with a calculated stress capital buffer well above the minimum resulting in a continued preliminary scb at the floor this demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry in keeping with our results in june we announced a planned increase for our quarterly common stock dividend subject to board approval and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under a current authorization of up to a total of billion in subject to market conditions and other factors we plan another billion buyback in third quarter lastly we are quite pleased to return roughly billion to shareholders in the second quarter of consisting of just over billion of common share repurchases and over million in common stock dividends turning to slide which provides a summary of our second quarter results while there is certainly still work to do we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mixed and divergent backdrop robust expansion in our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas highlighting the resiliency of the franchise next id like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter at a macro level while we know that rate expectations have been moving our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards which suggests that the fed the ecb and the boe will all continue to hike in to varying degrees state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 in terms of average equity markets we currently expect us equity markets to be up about quarteronquarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter end and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average regarding fee revenue in on a sequential quarter basis we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately to with servicing fees down to as the below average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in this will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit we expect management fees to be up around to we expect front office software and data quarteronquarter to be down as we do not expect the level of onpremise renewals in that we saw this quarter we expect the other fee revenue line to come in around million to million in which is higher than prior years but down post the accounting change impact in regarding nii after three doubledigit sequential increases in nii last year we now expect nii to decrease to on a sequential quarter basis driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into our outlook assumes that average noninterestbearing deposits declined by approximately billion from to as we look forward to we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back book and most central banks begin to pause with that context we expect that nii decline to be much less somewhere in the range of down to versus and we expect nii to then stabilize around those levels but it will depend on market conditions and our expectation is that declines in noninterestbearing deposits will be small as well likely in the down to billion range versus turning to expenses we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and we expect to take action in to bend the cost curve as such we expect that expenses will be down to on a sequential quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses as always this is on an exnotables basis and we are keeping an eye on the fdic assessment which could be a notable item and as i noted previously given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter we expect our effective tax rate to be between and for the third quarter with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator we can now open the call for questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from brennan hawken from ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions eric id like to sort of doubleclick on some of the comments that you made about deposits so you talked about back book pricing in the us dollar book does that mean that we should be thinking about the potential for betas to exceed here when that starts to work through and what kind of magnitude do you think that could reach and could you also help me understand the euro because when i look in the financial supplement and the breakout by currency it looks like the euro deposit costs were up about low bps quarteroverquarter which seems like a beta thats a good deal higher than the you referenced i know theres some swap noise so maybe thats what it is but could you maybe flesh that out a bit for me eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan sure let me start on the betas that we saw in particular in the us book because we are at a period in the interest rate cycle where weve now had multiple basis points moved its been a very strong signal to our clients that rates are much much higher much more quickly and much more visibly and at the same time they now have because of the highly inverted yield curve they have real substitute alternatives that they used to not have in the past whether its treasuries whether its money market whether its repo theres a range of what they can invest in and what we found is that our larger clients and we primarily have large sophisticated clients are quite active in thinking about their alternatives and that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that weve come to and the speed if we think about the us deposit betas they were in the to range the last couple quarters this quarter we saw and yes we expect next quarter well be well over and whats driving that is really a catch up in the back book we have clients coming to us as youd expect just like it happens with retail deposits for retail banks then we have sophisticated large clients coming back and saying look some of our lower transactional rate levels or midtier rate levels are something that theyd like us to adjust and in a way what i think we has played out is that while spreads widen for us on the deposit book for some period of time were now seeing a convergence back to where they would have been and thats coming through and so what we have in the cycle is actually a number of quarters of below beta then we get to beta and then we are going to have a quarter where betas are well above that level and its really a catchup in the back book and thats whats playing through it is what is beginning to drive this higher reduction in nii this quarter the quarteronquarter that you saw you saw in my outlook we are expecting to production in nii this coming quarter and if you peel that apart some of that is the continued rotation out of noninterestbearing but some of it and a good part of it is this catchup in the back book thats playing through state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 we do think that over time weve seen the bulk of that and that that will begin to moderate and im certainly happy to go into that and some of our perspectives as we drill down deeply into our areas but thats the context on your other question on euros we should probably follow up i think we see betas quarteronquarter of about but we should probably just follow up offline because i think thats deep in the supplement and well probably do that with you and the ir team brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay no problem and then another question just quickly on fee revenue you flagged that the large client migration is going to be part of the outlook is the how much of that will be impacting the third quarter delta and then how much will be how should we be thinking about the timeframe for whatever is left and when that would end up playing out eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think the broader context as you recall brennan is that we disclosed that the large client deconversion was going to happen over multiple years we announced it well over a year ago and we described it in our k at about of fee revenue so you can calculate that through i think in our fourth quarter earnings call in january i described that we had seen about million on a run rate come out but ill i can reconfirm that this in the next quarter third this coming third quarter well see about million come out sequentially and then in the fourth quarter theres another piece of about another million that will come out as well and then after that its several more quarters before we see the later and final installments but thats incorporated into our guide brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys so just maybe staying on the deposit question for another minute why do you guys think this catchup happening now sort of late in the cycle weve obviously been in a higher rate environment for well over a year so curious if you can provide more color on particular customer segments in the us thats driving that and sort of the discussions around that and then maybe as you sort of think about the end state for us interestbearing deposits i think youre at or so today the cumulative beta on that is i think is around relative to the fed funds rate should we think of that approaching i dont know kind of how do you think about where that deposit price in the us will stabilize eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 alex its a good question i mean were clearly navigating and living through an interest rate environment that weve not seen in two decades right youve got to go back precrisis before you see prevailing rates i think if you also think about how swiftly weve gotten to where we are thats why we created we put some of this information back on page in our materials you see this cycle has moved twice as far in terms of the uptick in rates in half the time of the last cycle and so what plays out as that happens is that we always have clients that as rates move up they begin discussing with us and engaging with us on what would be appropriate maybe putting in place multiple balance tiers having discussions about their expectations we negotiate and so forth and you can imagine large client discussions occur over three six sometimes even ninemonth periods and so if you kind of turn back the clock and say when did some of those discussions occur some of them early ones may have started second quarter of last year third quarter of last year fourth quarter of last year because there was also a perspective among our clients and us for that matter that rates might continue to but they might have gone to or which would have put us and our clients in a different position from a nim and nii and ratesetting perspective so i think its really the speed of this that has played out on one hand and on the other the inverted yield curve gives clients and the then the prevalence of the money funds and treasuries and so forth give clients an alternative right thats more vivid id say than in some of the past cycles and so thats the kind of client behavior what we have seen is that if you decompose our book some of this activity is in the noninterestbearing deposits which have come down and some of it is in the interestbearing back book because some clients with noninterestbearing deposits come to us and say look can you make them now interestbearing at a certain rate and what weve seen is some real segmentation of that book as an example the average account in noninterest bearing theres about accounts the average account is barely over million what you can do in some of the analytic work weve done is separate out the higherbalance noninterestbearing clients and client accounts from the lowerbalance ones not surprisingly the higherbalance accounts are down yearoveryear in balance terms by right the large number of smaller accounts are down by and so this is where what were starting to work through with what ill describe as the burndown how much of the larger deposits and noninterestbearing have migrated to interestbearing right at what rate and our perspective is that we are now working through ill describe as a catchup on the back book some of that is noninterestbearing deposits moving to interestbearing and some of that is interestbearing being priced up and as we think about it we think that the peak of that catchup will play out in third quarter as we scan the deposit types the larger more sophisticated clients versus the smaller clients and thats why we expect both the catchup to continue into the third quarter and likely peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate in the fourth quarter and to burn down alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then like just the end game in terms of what you ultimately think us deposit cost is going to look like relative to kind of the and the fed funds at eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 i think its ive not calculated it directly on a cost versus rate basis on a nim basis but i guess we could back into it if itd be helpful to you as we think about the longrange view of nii on our book ive given some guidance for nii for nii i think our instinct is that nii will settle in this million to million range per quarter and if its helpful we can try to calculate that back into a spread on assets or a spread or a cost of funds on deposits and follow up with you alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you thats helpful thanks and my bigger picture question for you guys and to ron as well is i think you mentioned productivity efforts in light of the fact that nii has clearly become a bigger headwind over the next several quarters and you guided servicing fees down in the third quarter so as you think about measuring those productivities are you solving for overall pretax margin stability are you solving for kind of fee margin stability sort of like ex nii how should we think about sort of measuring the productivity efforts in light of a more challenging revenue backdrop ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah alex i mean where we start with is i mean because what youre describing is outcomes of the productivity efforts and these are not new these are ongoing we really start with how do we create more scale on our business how do we increase speed lower error rates increase client satisfaction take out manual interventions so the measures that were using would be the traditional productivity measures and this has been underway now for several years youve been seeing the results in our and weve been able to manage costs certainly relative to others but in terms of how we think about the business going forward particularly given that nii is no longer a tailwind in terms of an outcome basis we really think about the operating leverage i think as the key outcome were managing to if thats the question youre asking alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah sure the operating leverage got it all right thank you very much ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks operator your next question comes from rob wildhack from autonomous research your line is now open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys im just trying to ask about the asset side and the securities book quickly decent uplift in yield again plus basis points can you give some color some numbers around the front book back book difference there and how much repricing can sort of assist nii going forward state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp rob its eric there is a good bit of tailwind that comes from the front book back book i think this on a kind of yearonyear basis long rates were quite constructive from a yearonyear nii standpoint the long rate tailwind yearonyear was in the million basis so its quite substantial on a quarteronquarter the long rate tailwind is closer to million million so its not insubstantial and i think as we see some steepness in the curve come back or i guess ill describe less inversion weve got some weve got abilities to leg into duration or curve position or in some cases some amount of convexity where wed find it helpful from a rate standpoint like you said average rates on the investment portfolio in aggregate was basis points or so the runoff is a good bit below that kind of in the 180basispoint range so basis points basis points south of that and the rollon that occurs is wellabove that 270basispoint average its closer to basis points or more so youve got a nice tailwind there thats playing through we also have a tailwind on the on short rates for international currencies so thats helpful and then we are we continue to invest and think about opportunities across currency from a basis standpoint and so forth and weve got some latitude to do that as well given our global balance sheet robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks eric and then one more just on the operational deposits if i use the numbers on page operational or excuse me overall deposits are down and operational deposits are down as a percentage of the mix conceptually what would be driving that i guess im confused as to why operational deposits would be down yearoveryear more than nonoperational deposits eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think theres a little bit of i look at that data and i think youve got roughly similar movements in operational and nonoperational deposits i think whats happening in this part of the cycle is as deposits or ill say as cash for our clients is more valuable right they are selectively thinking about how much cash do i absolutely must keep in the in their custodial accounts and if you think about it they make that decision in i think its more than different accounts themselves right its a very large and disparate set of decisions and subdecisions by 100000plus fund managers and many many fund boards and so theyre trying to see hey can i edge it down and thats why at this point in the cycle you see total deposits drift down but also operational what they end up needing to trade off and the reason why itll level off over time is that they need a certain amount of deposits so they dont overdraw they fund managers really hate the overdraw at end of day and then theres also a governor where we engage with our clients on intraday and make sure that they have enough cash to cover their transactional flow and throughput but were just at the period where in the core custody accounts youve got this drift downwards where theyre trying to optimize without going too far and thats what youre seeing but this is expected we expect the operational deposits to stay comfortably in this kind of range and its a part of the kind of custodial operations which is what makes them so sticky right because they need to be there state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 for the very significant daily hourly and minutebyminute transactional flows that we are processing on their behalf so that they arent overdrawn robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks eric eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from glenn schorr from evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks eric maybe just a different attempt at the deposit discussion so i get clients wanting more yield i bought treasuries too we all did but is there any point where the client profitability discussion has teed like are they able to move of nonoperating deposits if they want like what are discussions youre having with them about doing more with state street in areas like fx like lending alpha but maybe you could update us on what youre doing to try to help impact what seems like you cant impact the deposit side so is there anything else you can do eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me start there glenn and i think ron will play in as well because a number of us have these engaging conversations with clients i think from a burndown standpoint let me first take it from that angle is if you think about our billion of deposits weve got deposits at a number of different price tiers and we have kind of very large sophisticated clients and then kind of that large tail of small and midsized clients of the billion we think theres about billion that weve been very focused on and continue to be focused on so about a quarter of our total deposits are with these clients that as weve talked about the last couple questions theres been a real catchup on the back book i described that because of that billion which is either a very low price or zero price for our larger and most sophisticated clients where we have these engaging and balance of trade discussions right we have around weve got about billion thats behind us where largely weve repriced those deposits weve had those discussions and some of those have come with some balance of trade improvements or some commitments on stability on fees and those are behind us included in the outlook that i provide beyond the billion theres another billion thats underway right now thats included in my third quarter outlook right so that gets us to billion almost billion of the million and then theres a trail that well still have and so i think from a client discussion and negotiation standpoint the third quarter we expect to be the peak i think what youll find is that each of these questions on deposits certainly rates goes through a pricing committee from a balance sheet management standpoint but very quickly those go to the most senior client executives and all the way up to our csuite because those are large theyre very large and thats where we engage and i think what youll see over time is some of that well come back through in fx revenues and sec lending revenues and the absence of fee rate reductions in the future right on one hand state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 and on the other hand some of what we do here is also work with clients on extending the range of what we do for them when it comes to managing their cash right i think some of the reason youre seeing the uptick in cash with in our asset management business is because some of those clients say look id like to be in a cash money market sweep and so weve been doing that you see our repo business continues to do very very well its actually an add its a stabilizer to nii or an add to nii on a yearonyear basis and stabilizing and its a stable source of nii income quarteronquarter because weve been able to shift some of the client cash to those areas so there are some offsets as well there but thats a bit of a start ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah glenn what i would add to what eric said is that the if you think about over the last four five years our focus on pricing has been initially was on fee pricing and kind of addressing if not combating the fee compression and really working that in an institutional way and in a very high skilled way and escalating those or elevating those decisions way above where they used to be deposits for up until this rate cycle really werent part of that because i mean there are times that we would just assume not have had the deposits weve now integrated that as eric has implied into that discussion but also included a full share of wallet analysis and the part of this is recognizing that these institutions are very large and when you have a pricing discussion and im putting that in air quotes it really depends on what it is and what we have worked to avoid is to not have a series of unilateral discussions without understanding and making sure that at the highest levels of our clients they understand the impact of this and just reminding them that you have the fee you have because of this assumption on other services that were going to provide you or some assumption on deposits and those conversations are actually starting to work well its caused a change of process for us another change of process for us but more importantly its changed in the way how were engaging and at what level were engaging with these clients and so more to go there but we also think its a skill that now developed will help us through various kinds of cycles going forward glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks for all that color operator your next question comes from steven chubak from wolfe research please proceed sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning this is actually sharon leung filling in for steven just on the deposits outside of the rotation out of nib can you talk about the overall trajectory of total deposits particularly because it looks like more recent liquidity drawdown has come out of rrp instead of deposits just wanted to get your thoughts on the expectations for the trajectory on deposits from here in the context of qt treasury issuance etcetera eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah its eric its hard to really gauge the deposit changes outright i think were a little more focused on the net interest im sorry the noninterestbearing deposits where weve signaled another billion in likely outflow this state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 coming quarter thats less of an outflow than in the second quarter so youre starting to see some of the burn down that ive described in the external environment i think from the h8 reports those banks weve seen about a sequential fall in deposits for the trust banks we tend to have more deposits coming in when deposits in the bank system increase and we have somewhat more coming out when deposits in the bank system come out and probably just the absolute sophistication of our clients so were we expect a downtick in deposits again next quarter but its just been a little more focused on the noninterestbearing because thats where it makes a big difference i think there is always some movement in interestbearing deposits especially at the higher rate tier because what were finding increasingly as we get to a little more of this we expect to get to a time stabilization or at least a little more of a balance with our clients now what theyre going to do is its hard for them to move an underlying operating deposit that actually has to cover the hundreds thousands in some cases tens of thousands of transactions that are flowing through their particular account but sometimes theyll move the thin margin deposits to a treasury and so we might lose basis points on something and theyll pick up basis points on treasury so theres some of that thats going on and i think in truth thats not as dominant a driver of our nii at this point sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that and then as a followup just on some of the updated capital rules that are coming i understand you probably wont be able to give much color because we havent seen a proposal yet but just in terms of like expected ways you might be able to mitigate some of that impact and which businesses might be more impacted for you guys eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i mean theres obviously were like many waiting to see more from the rules weve the last time we saw basel iii end game draft from either the us or international regulators was several years back so i think weve we expect some higher capital requirements just hard to tell how much we do think therell be effects on different parts of our businesses so the new rules will come with an operational deposit operational capital charge that probably will be relatively hard to influence because we actually want to build our feedriven businesses and so those i think will just come with a capital requirement thats that will be an add therell be some reduction on the lending book so thatll be helpful and then i think in particular while the fundamental review of the trading book will affect the universal banks potentially in a negative way for us the sec finance business will tend to be a positive will be in a positive territory where capital requirements will be less well no longer need to hold capital to indemnify treasury so theyll finally become economically more rational in the safer areas right as they should be they should obviously capital needs to be held for the riskier activities but we dont traffic in the riskier areas and i think that in some ways thatll give us an opportunity to grow those areas that are quite aligned with our client base like sec finance and actually deploy capital quite more actively and so i think therell be a mix of impacts were going to see as it comes through but like many were considering whats to come and well react accordingly as it does state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you operator your next question comes from brian bedell from deutsche bank please proceed brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my question ron i guess i wanted to come back to your comments on the basically the overall revenue per client if i can sort of summarize it that way obviously there are different components of how clients the asset servicing clients pay for the business and there are many different ways aside from the core fees that they can do that so as you think about that across the client base i know you have looked at this more holistically across clients over many many years but with the deposit beta going up is that sort of revenue per client going down or do you think youre able to actually be able to improve the fee rate given that they arent paying as much on the compensating balances ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah brian its a good question and what i was referring to and what youre referring to is what i would call how we think about this tactically clientbyclient but i also want to come back to the strategic elements of this also in terms of theres no one answer for any particular client because if you think about it in the core back office business youve got custody fund accounting and theres a pricing element to that along typically with associated deposits in more and more instances obviously weve a client might have a middle office assignment with us where were doing we are their back office and obviously going all the way to alpha and then theres the question of are we doing fx and securities finance with them obviously fx is a function of are they do they have occasion to use fx and increasingly most managers do securities finance its manager by manager so the reason why im saying its tactical theres a holistic conversation that needs to occur here and its important on both sides ours included to lay out for the client that remember all we did for you over the past few years to get you through whatever fee challenges they were having that was predicated on x and x might be an assumed deposit level it might be on an assumed fx level x isnt playing out we need to have a conversation on this and that could in cases lead to more fees or it could and the more typical outcome is that well hey were not doing this with you lets try and do that or even theres this set of funds over here that weve never talked about whatever cayman islands or something and lets see if we can move those i mean the ph deposit situation is a challenge the conversations its spurring are opportunities and theyre real opportunities theres senior people intimately involved in these because we dont get a lot of redos on them this is the moment to be doing it so we think its a way to i mean again the kind of nii outflow is a significant headwind but we think its an opportunity to mitigate some of it the strategic side of this brian i dont want to lose right because going back to the acquisition of charles river the launch of alpha all the development weve been doing were now seeing onboarding happening there state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 with the typical onboarding journey tends to be the lower fee complicated kind of middle office stuff starts first and then theres followon services and its making sure that we are implementing addressing and implementing those followon services as fast as possible so when we talked earlier and talked about the onboarding talked about that we were able to move a little over trillion into to be onboarded to onboarded what will follow there is other services and increase kind of the revenue per asset per i mean thats the way alpha works and thats the way alpha is going to play out which is why notwithstanding the shortterm issues that eric has raised in terms of weve got this client transition were actually quite optimistic over the what i would call the short to medium term as we look into about the revenue picture brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats great color and then maybe just on the expense side eric you mentioned the expense levers are they more tactical in nature or do you see sort of an ability to reengineer continue to reengineer the cost base youve already done a great job in reducing costs structurally over the last several years i dont know if were like mostly through that and when you do have the cost saves you reinvest them in growth initiatives or is there an ability to sort of reduce the overall cost structure ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp brian let me address that first and then eric will comment we are definitely not through this and by that i mean when we started down this journey a couple years ago we obviously addressed call it what you want the lower hanging fruit the kinds of things that we could get at without a lot of technology investment without a lot of reengineering but there is more to do and were making a lot of progress on it weve got people in place now on both the operations reengineering side and on the technology side that are working this through the way this has played through in our results youve seen what our expenses have been but weve also been able to invest more in the businesses than we otherwise would and we think that that journey has more to go and youll see that and well report on that quarter after quarter what we also talked about though is that there are some tactical things that we can do and should do just given the kind of outlook that weve described to you and those would be less about reengineering and more about how do we think about shortterm things like consensus and those things eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and just to round that out weve got to pay for performance so when we have larger we deliver larger sales well pay for that when its a little lighter as you saw well rein that in and thats part of the execution mines that we have weve also just given some of the evolution on salary increases and that weve all worked through over the last couple quarters over the last year we also feel like its time where we have enough staff and so weve put in place a hiring freeze because we need to contain our staffing costs so we need to make sure as we reengineer we actually redeploy our folks to say new business areas or to growth areas and actually pare down others and the way to do that in a more emphatic way tactically right is to be particularly disciplined on hiring and freeze that state street corp stt corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 or just limit it and so given the shortterm performance were doing that as well which gives you a sense for our willingness to bend the cost curve brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc perfect thats great color thanks very much ron and eric operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to ron ohanley for closing remarks
