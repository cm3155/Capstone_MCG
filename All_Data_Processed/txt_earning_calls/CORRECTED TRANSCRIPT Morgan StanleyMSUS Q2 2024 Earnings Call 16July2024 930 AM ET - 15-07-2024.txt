led by strength in equity and a pickup in investment banking wealth management also delivered on our established strategy reporting record durable asset management fees and strong feebased flows together improved confidence and higher client engagement along with our focus on prioritizing investments yielded operating leverage and profitability the firms yeartodate efficiency ratio was benefiting from scale and reductions in our expense base year todate expenses benefited from lower litigation expenses the absence of back office integrationrelated costs and severance as well as our dedicated effort to prioritize our current spend on prioritization we remain committed to client and asset growth technology and targeted investments to ensure robust infrastructure that supports growth and addresses ongoing regulatory expectations now to the businesses institutional securities revenues of billion increased versus last year capturing the strength of the integrated investment bank across us and international markets higher activity in asia contributed to results strong performance in institutional equity as well as debt underwriting demonstrate the breadth of our client franchise in our markets business opportunities unfolded on the back of global political events and macroeconomic data investment banking revenues were billion the increase from the prior year was broad based we continue to invest in investment banking across talent and lending broadening and deepening our global coverage footprint in key sectors including financials healthcare technology and industrials these investments are beginning to have an impact as capital markets improve and activity picks up advisory revenues were million reflecting an increase in our completed ma activity versus the prior year the preannounced ma backlog continues to build and suggests diversification across sectors equity underwriting revenues of million improved versus the prior year driven by increases across most products but remained below historical averages from a geographical perspective we brought a number of transactions to market in europe and asia demonstrating the importance of having a strong global market footprint fixed income underwriting revenues were million well above fiveyear historical averages results reflect a meaningful pickup in noninvestmentgrade loan and bond issuance as tighter spreads and strong clo issuance provided opportunities for refinancing the investment banking backdrop continues to improve led by the us the advisory and underwriting pipelines are healthy across regions and sectors inflation data has continued to moderate which has helped stabilize front end rates and support boardroom confidence and sponsor reengagement as buyers and sellers make progress to close the valuation gap we expect that we are still in the early innings of an investment banking rebound subject to changes in rate path expectations and geopolitical developments our integrated investment bank is wellpositioned to service our clients turning to equity we continue to be a global leader in this business equity revenues of over billion up compared to last year reflect strong results across business and regions higher client engagement dynamic risk management and strength in asia all contributed to performance morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased from the prior year as client balances reached new peaks regionally we witnessed higher client activity in asia and seasonal patterns in europe cash results increased versus last year reflecting higher volumes across regions derivative results were up versus last years second quarter as client activity was higher and the business navigated the market environment well further the business benefited from corporate activity on the back of convertible issuances additional evidence of the integrated firm at work fixed income revenues of billion increased yearoveryear macro performance was up versus the prior year despite lower realized volatility clients were engaged around elections and political events in the quarter micro results improved yearoveryear driven by the growth of our more durable revenues as we continue to support our clients with financing solutions solid results in commodities were in line with the prior year turning to isg lending and provision in the quarter isg provisions were million driven by certain individual commercial real estate loans net chargeoffs were million primarily related to two commercial real estate loans for which we had previously already taken provisions turning to wealth management wealth management delivered strong results generating revenues of billion with record asset management fees our pbt margin continued to make progress towards our goal demonstrating our ability to grow and generate operating leverage through the cycle we are delivering on our differentiated scaled multichannel asset gathering strategy wealth management client assets reached trillion moving to our business metrics in the second quarter pretax profit was billion up yearoveryear with a reported margin of dcp negatively impacted our margin by approximately basis points the margin demonstrates the inherent operating leverage of our assetgathering strategy we are improving the efficiency with which we run the business asset management revenues of billion were up thats more than million in fees versus the prior year thats driven by higher average asset levels and the impact of cumulative positive feebased flows in the quarter feebased flows of billion were strong marking the seventh consecutive quarter of over billion bringing the yeartodate feebased flows to billion we are seeing a steady migration of assets from advisor led brokerage accounts to feebased accounts evidence that investments in our client acquisition funnel are paying off feebased assets now stand at trillion net new assets were billion reflecting headwinds from seasonal tax payments yeartodate net new assets are billion representing annualized growth of beginning period assets net flows will be lumpy in any given period of time and impacted by both the macroeconomic environment and businessspecific factors we believe both taxrelated outflows and increased spending particularly among highnetworth clients impacted flows this quarter still our first half nna growth remains solid transactional revenues were million excluding the impact of dcp revenues were up versus last year the increase was primarily driven by higher equityrelated transactions bank lending balances grew by billion to billion evidence that as the macroeconomic backdrop stabilizes our lending capabilities can be met and can meet our diversified client needs morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 total deposits of billion remains stable with sweep deposits down approximately billion sequentially mostly offset by growth in cds net interest income was down modestly to billion reflecting the decline in sweeps which was largely attributable to the seasonality of tax payments the wealth management business continues to perform well aggregating assets generating fees and benefiting from scale and our differentiated offering consistently earning approximately million a day in the third quarter we intend to make changes to our advisory sweep rates against the backdrop of changing competitive dynamics the impact of these intended changes will be largely offset with the expected gains from the repricing of our investment portfolio therefore third quarter nii will be primarily driven by the path of sweeps and nii could decline modestly in the third quarter importantly inclusive of these pricing changes the rate path and our expectations around client behavior we believe that nii should inflect higher as you look out into next year our wealth management strategy is predicated on gathering assets meeting our clients lending needs and offering advice asset management fees the core of our wealth management strategy continues to produce strong results reaching a record this quarter taken together we delivered a strong margin and we continue to work towards margins over time this quarter we reached approximately ph million in relationships across our three channels and we continue to invest in order to deepen engagement ai tools are helping advisors grow and wealth managements partnership with institutional securities is increasing connectivity around our workplace offering these investments have supported flows to our advisorled channel where average client duration is nearly years and growing the steady progress supports our journey towards 10trillionplus in total client assets turning to investment management revenues of billion increased from the prior second quarter supported by higher asset management revenues asset management and related fees were billion up yearoveryear reflecting higheraverage aum total aum ended the quarter at trillion performancebased income and other revenues were million as gains were driven primarily by our infrastructure us private credit and us private equity funds reflecting our investments in secular growth areas we recorded longterm net outflows of approximately billion we continue to see strong momentum across areas of strategic focus namely parametric consistent with current industry trends we saw outflows in our active equity strategies our business is well positioned given strength in areas of secular growth such as customization direct indexing and private alternatives our continued focus on global distribution combined with our deep structuring and product creation capabilities should support incremental growth turning to the balance sheet total spot assets decreased billion from the prior quarter to trillion our standardized cet1 ratio was client activity was strong and markets were open we actively supported clients with a focus on velocity of resources we also grew our cet1 capital by billion reflecting strong earnings and continued capital distribution the most recent stress test results reaffirm our durable business model and strong capital position for the third year in a row we announced a quarterly dividend increase of having generated over of earnings per share and an rotce yeartodate we entered the back half of the year from a position of strength with a robust capital base to support clients investment banking pipelines are healthy and diverse dialogues are active and markets are open in wealth management strong feebased flows and the realization of operating leverage continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working as capital morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 markets become more active we see opportunities for retail clients to engage and over time deploy their cash cash and equivalent balances into feebased products with that we will now open the line up to questions question and answer section operator we are now ready to take in questions operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi there thank you edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning glenn sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning sharon i appreciate all the upfront commentary on nii in wealth i wanted to drill down a little bit on what you said so if you have trillion in client assets in advisory and they keep a handful of percent of money in cash that change youre making in rate paid on advisory on deposits and advisory accounts can add up to like a good amount of money so i wanted to get a little more sharper focus on what you said about nii and then what exactly did you say the offset is on the nii thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure thanks glenn for the question actually the portion of the sweep balances that are impacted are as you mentioned the sweep on the advisorled channel which is actually a small portion of the overall bdp that we disclose so it is a small portion of that overall stack morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 and the increase in pricing is being offset largely by the repricing of the investment portfolio right so as things mature and that investment portfolio reprices its that change in the quarter amount that will offset it when we look ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi and is there a particular reason why you only have to focus on repricing in this smaller portion of the advisorled channel meaning indiscernible sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah certainly yeah what i would note there is that what we think about when we think about sweeps broadly is mainly in transactional accounts and in those transactional accounts we have a wide range of choices in products for our clients and so therefore they have a lot of options as you think about their transactional accounts and brokerage operator well move to our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just maybe good morning ted maybe sticking with nii and more importantly on pretax margin right you had an extremely strong quarter the stocks weakened this morning and it has to do with the nii drag on wealth revenues and margin so one i think sharon your level of visibility into nii lots of moving pieces around client behavior maybe we get interest rate cuts just give us a sense of if history is any guide on what rate cuts would imply for client behavior or is there cash to assets that youre looking at that gives you comfort around nii potentially stabilizing post and then maybe for you sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc a question ted go ahead yeah morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah so why dont i take that and then you can ask your second question so you are pointing at a great point ebrahim as we look ahead through time which was the second point of my guidance is that when we look over the next year we are seeing and we expect that we should see an inflection in nii and that is predicated on the points that you mentioned which is that as you see rate cuts we would expect those balances to stabilize remember outside of the tax quarter this particular quarter we had been seeing a stabilization in those sweep deposits so its important to recognize that that has been happening reaching that frictional level of transactional cash so that would likely continue and then over time youd also begin to see a benefit as rates to be cut that bdp could actually see inflows which youve seen from a historical perspective but in addition to that you have two other factors one is the repricing of the portfolio which ive also already mentioned and the second piece has to do with lending we look to continue to support our clients with lending products and you are beginning to also see that potentially reach an inflection this is the first quarter that weve seen this type of lending growth since the interest rate hikes began weve seen now use of sbl products rather than just it being offset by paydowns so those are all encouraging signs when we look ahead over the course of the next year for nii ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess my second question was just talking to investors when we look at the pretax margin target the question is whether this is aspirational whether the bar is set too high given how competitive the business is so remind us in terms of your comfort level on the pretax margin and to the extent you can the timeline of when we get there and when we get there should that be a sustainable pace for the business thanks edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley thanks ebrahim confidence level high if you take a step back there are three pieces to the wealth management line asset management transactional net interest income as you know in the asset management context those are fees that are going to feebased accounts advisory led those figures are up sequentially and yearoveryear that is feepaying advice last quarter the net new assets into that category was billion so feebased flows that continues to be a growth piece of the wealth management story the second cylinder is transactional transactional has been relatively weak which is a link to general weakness in overall capital markets activity and as you hear from our bullish commentary with respect to overall corporate finance activity in the investment bank that will bleed through over time to the transactional line and then third the net interest income line and as sharon said that will inflect and should inflect over the next year you put those together the scale of the business the funnel and the processing of million of revenues a day that continue to grow were going to continue to achieve operating leverage its that simple were investing in etrade were investing in the traditional advisor and were spending a lot of time top of house focused on workplace which we think is an enormous opportunity across our corporate and sponsor base morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 in january i had said was the goal we were in the mid we just printed gaap exdcp its a core stated objective it will take some quarters to get there but we intend on achieving it over time as we continue to grow assets and scale in the business operator well move to our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi ted youve said this and sharon repeated this that the industry is only in the early innings of an investment banking rebound i have to say weve heard that for a couple of years and so now is this time why is this time real do you expect the rebound to continue through the normally slow summer period before the election how many years what gives you confidence that this is for real and how much is your backlog up quarterover quarter edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley its an excellent question because youre exactly right that a number of folks have been calling for this and it has been sort of a delayed shoots if you will but i think now were seeing some tempering of the inflation prints and some normalization rates were also beginning along with that to see the market broaden out you of course have seen that over the last number of weeks and i think we can now expect broader corporate finance activity to quicken whether that is across the corporate community or sponsors or other institutions and the early sign of this kind of activity can be seen in the convertibles product global convertibles activity is up significantly and as you know on the margin ladder it typically goes converts ipo and then ma in the context of bakeoffs and the like in some spaces were seeing bakeoffs running at tripleplus the year overyear rate that they were at for sectors and for some of our client groups weve been seeing now the launch of traditional ipos and were seeing ma pipeline kicking in so corporate community sponsor community crossborder community i think were in the early stages of a multiyear investment banking led cycle if you believe the economy is going to hold up led by the us you should expect then to see that if theres some regulatory normalization to across a whole bunch of the sectors that are typically most active so we are quite convicted on this call mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just one push back i mean with interest rates so much higher than theyve been in the past dont you think that could get in the way when people are looking to borrow money for deals and the like is this a matter of simply waiting for rates to go lower or thats not going to get in the way edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 i mean its a fair question youve written about this in the context of what was the normal before financial repression right and i would take the view that in the context of the last years even some normalization because i dont know that were going to go into a fullblown rate cycle to your point some normalization of rates will still have you at or on the front end and even some steepening potentially so now were just back to the old weighted average cost of capital of the mid in most normal economic periods and the game will have to go on because theres just been so much activity that has been suppressed by any kind of measure percentage of asset stock percentage of market cap and the stickiness that were seeing in the sponsor community too needs to unglue there is an enormous as you know multitrilliondollar stockpile between the two sides of sitting on inventory that needs to be released and then dry powder thats been raised that will act as a competitive weapon against the competitive bid from the corporate community that has to contend with the reality of a smaller world with real sovereign risk and real cost of capital differences from one jurisdiction to another so in short unless you were to tell me were going to go into a fullblown recession which none of us can call and that even if we saw rates normalize to something that is along the lines of the historic on the front end i think you will see over the next number of quarters and really over the next number of years a resumption of more normalized ma activity with the key difference being that the financial sponsor community has now institutionally come of age they have global reach they can work the entire capital structure they will work in concert with corporate partners as you know they dont actually have to act as lone wolves and they can now work with us to finance the package so its not just the straight ma advice or the straight ipo itd also be bespoke offerings in the privatepublic space interest rate and foreign exchange hedging and the other ornaments on the investment banking tree that a couple of the leading global investment banks can bring and this is really why over the last couple of years to the extent weve done a socalled frontoffice hiring it really has been to target several very highquality investment bankers who typically have spent their entire careers at one firm and have decided to come to the morgan stanley platform and were seeing the fruits of that across industries so i am quite bullish on it certainly take your point that it has been a number of quarters sort of on the promise but i think as we get into and the election coming and then the election behind us we should see that activity continue on a sustainable pace operator our next question comes from dan fannon with jefferies please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning dan daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning good morning was hoping to get a little bit more color on the flows in the quarter within wealth maybe the breakdown from the channels and contribution last quarter i think we saw family office be an outsized contributor but hoping to get a little bit more color on where the flows were sourced in sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 sure ill take that we continue to see broadbased sourcing in terms of where those assets are coming from in this particular quarter as i mentioned the biggest offset and drag though is really from taxes so you still have workplace accounts you still have the advicebased account directly you still have selfdirected all of those places remain contributors what continues in my mind to be most interesting though isnt just the contribution that youre getting from the three various channels but the fact that you have in the advicebased channel its not just coming from existing clients but its split with existing and net new clients and some of those net new clients are also relationships that are being sourced from workplace so i would not just directly focus on what channel is it coming from but how are you seeing those channel and that interplay work because thats actually the power of the differentiated platform once you have if somebody who wants more differentiated advice from selfdirected speaks to an advisor that advisor sees net new clients bring in assets and then thats new acquisitions into the funnel and eventually into fee based so its really the whole ecosystem that i would call your attention to rather than just one isolated leg edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley which is part of the reason that workplace is so important because at workplace i can continue to experience success amongst the corporate and sponsor community that has an affinity effect on the top of the house at those institutions in terms of their own wealth and then potentially other products around it so it can be an indirect sale where you arent necessarily going directly to the prospective client via the fa but you could actually work potential clients through the institutionalized effect of workplace where we do a great job educating on wellness financial wellness and then effectively institutionalizing ourselves by overseeing incentive comp through the morgan stanley solium product and having succeeded on an ms at work mandate which as you know is a durable sticky asset that effectively is seen by the entire employee base you can start working your way up the funnel to the senior executives of that firm daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator well move to our next question from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning brennan morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning yeah good morning ted thanks for taking my question id like to just drill down a little more forgive the second followup here on the repricing change that you mentioned in your prepared comments sharon so the repricing that weve seen in the securities book has been slow so im just kind of curious as to why you think that will help offset the repricing actions that youre taking on the deposit side is that because it will be a phased repricing and therefore theres an ability to have the phased benefit in the asset side offset and then just a nittygritty question on it is the switch going to be to money fund sweep rather than higher yielding deposits and then that way you can just slowly replace that funding as you see fit sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so thanks brennan ill take that question no all the changes that well make will happen are expected to happen in the third quarter and so those different changes will be made and theyll be based on various competitive dynamics brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and then is this going to be focused on the advisory relationship similar to what weve seen from some other wirehouse competitors and could you just is it the changes that have recently been announced by wells and bofa is that what you mean by competitive dynamics or is there something else that im not aware of sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley no thats exactly as i stated it and it will just be limited as you said to the sweeps that are dealt within the advisorled channel operator our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning devin devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc hey great good morning audio gap sharon ph hi the first question just on another one on the gwm flows sharon you mentioned tax season is a factor which i completely get but then you also mentioned increased client spending and i just wanted to drill into that just whether thats something that could continue whether it was seasonal or influenced by inflation just trying to understand that component of the impact on flows sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 yeah i think thats a really interesting question i did call it out weve seen increased spending by higher net worth and so higher income bands are certainly spending we see that in the data alongside actual spending we see that in purchases of homes we see that in various tailored investments so that cohort so to speak is using its cash in different ways and its various investment in different ways so i do think that thats an interesting dynamic thats playing out i know that others have mentioned it within their portfolios as well its only something were seeing in our data devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc okay got it thank you and then a followup just on the interplay between investment banking and trading and appreciate the commentary on kind of the improving capital markets backdrop which is great to hear and kind of the expectation from our end that theres going to be a lot more primary issuance in equities maybe in debt as well as ma picks up so just trying to think about what that means for the trading businesses equities and fixed income and whether you guys feel like we could maybe sustain around these really high levels or even maybe even the wallet could move higher just as you get a stronger primary issuance market edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley well i know that the competitive set will naturally speak to areas where integration can be an asset here we have we believe something really special inside of our institutional securities business our socalled integrated investment bank which has been ongoing for now were getting on seven or eight years now under dan simkowitzs direction and this is a sort of critical facet of business strategy at our place because you have now the appropriate and important relationships that have been built across fixed income equities and banking through our capital markets new issue business you have those now having been compounded and advanced by the mobilization of some folks from one division to another so theres real familiarity now with the work product a lot of the work product as you know is not traditional vanilla ipos yes there are some on the horizon that are quite substantial and wed expect that to be an important part of the calendar but theres also a more bespoke product whether it be convertibles or products in the private area or products that effectively necessitate high quality structuring and advice and that can only be brought to the boardroom if you have worldclass investment bankers who can lean on the expertise of their colleagues not just in the new issue business but as appropriate in institutional equities and in fixed income and if you look at our fixed income business for example and fixed income underwriting youll see that the share gains have been quite extraordinary and that the yearoveryear revenue number i believe is up that speaks to the fine work thats been done by folks not just in the debt capital markets business which is housed inside of our new issue business linked to banking but also working closely with fixed income professionals whether they are in the securitized products group and our commodities area broader credit or in our macro space ie interest rate and foreign exchange so when you get into the knitting of isg our integrated investment bank you see that part of the reason that we are bullish not just to mikes earlier question on the denominator but also on our ability to increase the numerator is not so much because we think there is a need to deploy a lot more capital we will do so as appropriate when the markets demand it but that we are able to get the kind of bespoke advice for clients that morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 comes from the familiarity of our people the quality of the advice that is differentiated and importantly that its global so that we can bring it to the client base so that is part of i think the secret sauce that weve been working hard on to generate above cost of capital returns inside the investment bank on a standalone basis and that obviously doesnt include even the synergies that wed see across the firm into wealth and investment management but your question is on the investment bank specifically and i feel really good about the way its structured the leadership that we have within it the experience set and then our ability now to tap into this next cycle which will be different than the last one rates will be well higher than that of financial repression well be toggling between some bouts of inflation and potential recession well be dealing with the unpredictability going to not only our own cycle us election cycle but the world around us but also the coming of age and the institutionalization of the financial sponsor community where we have very strong relationships with that leadership group from top to bottom across the investment bank wealth and investment management operator for our next question well move to steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning steve sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so maybe just starting off with a question just on operating leverage within isg yeartodate the incremental margins are quite strong just north of you spoke constructively on ib and trading inflecting positively just want to better understand what you believe is a sustainable incremental margin as activity steadily builds especially given some of the growth at least from here may skew a bit more heavily towards investment banking which tends to be more compensable sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so when you look at it i would really focus steve on the efficiency ratio targets that weve put for the whole firm right we think that the firm can run at or below the over time through a durable cycle the issue with your specific question is you yourself highlighted is it depends on where those different revenues are coming from so if there might be periods of time where its higher bce related there might be periods of time where you have different jurisdictions associated with it but broadly speaking the enterprise weve given margins as it relates to wealth and the sort of wealth and investment management space and then you have the isg space morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 so by definition if youre running at efficiency ratio more broadly you look for an entire enterprise to run at somewhere of a margin edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley yeah the only thing i would add to that is of course as you know theres real seasonality in the business fixed income tends to have its strongest quarter streetwide in the first quarter investment banking typically in the fourth quarter thats not every year but thats typically how it shakes out third quarter tends to be weaker in the summer months and then its sort of all about september and obviously this september will be one that will be driven in part time by sentiment around the upcoming elections so thats kind of the seasonality piece the other is just the scale within the businesses id be remiss again not to sort of underscore the importance of having reached billion in the equities business this has been a leading business where we have been number one or number two for the last dozen years and we see the clients are much in demand of our services across cash derivatives and prime brokerage and then connecting to investment banking i think that business has too hit an inflection point again where they can continue to prosecute highmargin business through the cycle all of this of course is dependent on the economy holding up and general asset price levels but given where we are right now were feeling good about that too steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thanks for that perspective and just a followup on the deposit discussion both you and your wirehouse peers announced similar actions on deposits which you noted sharon you mentioned it was informed by competitive dynamics but i wanted to better understand if theres any feedback you or your peers had received from regulators that prompted the decision because from our vantage point the timing of these pricing actions at this stage of the rate cycle is simply difficult to reconcile sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley im sorry steve we dont comment as you know on regulatory matters steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay fair enough i had to try thanks for taking my questions operator well move to our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning ted good morning sharon edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning gerard how are you morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you you gave us good insights into your thinking about what the capital markets could bring especially in investment banking and i think you touched on it in your comments ted or maybe you sharon that the transactional numbers could benefit from a stronger ecm business can you then take the next second derivative and share with us from your experience with solarium sic solium should we see that business pick up the workplace channel if more of these maybe private equity sponsor companies go public should the workplace channel see stronger revenues potentially in a stronger investment banking market over the next or months sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley i think thats a great question i know gerard a few years ago you also asked me about different values of those assets associated with what the underlying is i completely agree with you as you have workplace assets rise the value of those client assets rise new corporations issue their employees more stock they also grow their employee base it should absolutely add participants it should add new corporates it will add new net flows and now that we have all of that when you just had solium now you also have etrade and workplace and the platforms are integrated so as those flows flow into an etrade account people can transact on that and then as ted said we can also offer financial wellness so absolutely it helps that ecosystem begin to work gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and just as a followup ted if i take a step back obviously you guys have done a very good job in the last years of growing organically but then complementing that growth with acquisitions once we get the basel iii endgame final proposal maybe some gsib relief can you share with us as you look out over the next two or three years is there any parts of the picture today that youd like to enhance possibly with acquisitions or are you good where you are today edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley ill take the opportunity to sort of give a brief view on capital if i could gerard and link that to potential external opportunities we anticipated or we believe it was possible that we could have a tougher annual ccar test and indeed it was and what weve prioritized in potential uses of capital above all things has been dividend policy and as you know we are increasing dividend again to which at spot offers a dividend yield so that is the continued highest priority on use of capital if you include of course use of capital to inorganic opportunity second our clients we have continued to lean in for clients across the business segments as appropriate and you see the operating leverage across the businesses particularly across the investment bank but weve also thought about the buyback opportunistically and have been buying stock back and returning capital this past quarter more than billion between dividend and the buyback in a way that has been reflective of offering us that optionality morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 as we sit here today we are basis points above the buffer and importantly we continue to be in the g sib buffer which in one context wouldnt normally get much attention but does get attention in the context of your question which is sort of forwardlooking strategic opportunity its worth noting if we can manage to stay at assuming the framework holds through whatever basel brings that will be our buffer in so were basis points over and we accreted billion this quarter external ie inorganic therefore is something we can think about its just not something were going to think about in the short term the reality is weve got our forced hierarchy the forced hierarchy is dividend first investing in clients as appropriate achieving operating returns against that second and then third to buy back opportunistically down the road two three four years out if opportunities come across the horizon importantly after we have some definition around basel and continued potential refinement of what we understand to be inside ccar formulation so just general regulatory uncertainty sure we might look at stuff but i would tell you in the short term were very happy with the acquisitions that weve made over the last years and we are determined to generate operating leverage in each of the two major segments wealth and investment management and the integrated investment bank and then to obviously hit our efficiency ratios of and the margins and returns that weve talked about operator well move to our next question from saul martinez with hsbc please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good morning thank you for taking my questions edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning saul saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc good morning so i wanted to follow up on the earlier question on the outlook for your sales and trading businesses youve kind of consistently done about billion to billion of annual revenue in the post pandemic period in ficc and equities and right now we have a backdrop where were going to see rate cuts markets are strong issuance activity may pick up at the same time you have perhaps more competition from foreign banks who have lost share so how do you see do you have a view on how you see the wallet evolving for these businesses your ability to maintain or gain share in this backdrop and i guess ultimately do you think you can grow revenues here from a base that is materially higher than what it was prepandemic edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley i think the answer to that is that we would like to grow share that is durable we want to grow share in businesses that are connected to the core client base whether it be the global asset managers the leading alternative asset managers private equity and private credit players that have come into the floor and then our lead corporate and sovereign clients morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 there are products that can be offered there are very few firms that can do that globally we continue to have a worldclass markets business for example in asia where i believe we have the largest equities business weve been growing the business quite assiduously on the continent in the uk where our senior management has been putting in a lot of time and attention and as you know we have a differentiated joint venture with our friends and partners at mufg in tokyo so if you consider the global footprint of the firm in a world that continues to be equities based it continues to be an equities world you see it in the asset price momentum in the us you see now the potential for that to broaden to more names and more sectors and that obviously gives opportunity for folks in the stock picking business for example where weve been very strong traditionally in equities to do the indiscernible prime brokerage suite that we offer you could see continued uncertainty based on how the next administration handles the significant macro challenges facing the us whether youll see a steeper yield curve where youll see activity on the front and to the belly of the curve that of course offers all kinds of opportunities for the rates business and connected to corporate catalyst activity where on an ma acquisition the acquirer may wish to inoculate themselves from rate or foreign exchange risk and thats the service that we offer again i like the idea of growing durably inside the integrated investment bank i like the idea that we are working in sandboxes with the appropriate capital controls around that but that were allowing enough breathing space so that when our lead clients are looking to engage in a once in every few years catalyst event that we can fully offer the entirety of the advice and financing spectrum to them on demand so the answer would be to grow and grow responsibly id like to think we can inch up the numerator along with the denominator and then you would see that almost imperceptibly over the course of quarters and years saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc thats helpful thank you just i guess a quick followup related followup the roe in isg in the first half of the year early on as you highlighted in in investment banking cycle do have a view on where the institutional securities roe can get to as the investment banking cycle kind of plays out is there a view on sort of what a normalized roe would be here edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley were still early were still early in the cycle were watching it of course to the earlier question on when the green shoots come through on the highmargin ma product the reality of seasonality the uncertainty of rate path geopolitics us elections its hard to put a pin on what the returns will be in a given forward quarter until we kind of see some normalization in those uncertainties not to mention some of the regulatory stuff that were dealing with as we speak basel namely but yes youre right to point out that we are seeing some real operating leverage in the investment bank and over the course of a number of years as we think about not just the integrated firm but the returns generated inside of wealth and investment management and then we look at the returns inside the investment bank we are measuring that and were looking to have that contribute to the overall sustainable efficiency of the firm morgan stanley ms
