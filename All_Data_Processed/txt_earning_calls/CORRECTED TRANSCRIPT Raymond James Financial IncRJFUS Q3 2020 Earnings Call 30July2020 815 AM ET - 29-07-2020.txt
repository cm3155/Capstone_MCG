and good morning everyone and thanks so much for joining us this is our second call during the covid crisis and with the first one we were a little more geographically scattered so technology and internets willing and able were hopeful to have a good call here im really proud of how the firm has performed during this period with the covid crisis the social justice issues our associates and advisors have been amazing the advisors have focused on their clients growing their business with great net new asset numbers our associates have really worked hard to support them and all of raymond james has come together to discuss and make commitments on the social justice issue in august is raymond james cares month to see how were helping those needy and smaller groups ph virtually is really inspiring in getting into the numbers despite lower shortterm interest rates and economic uncertainty associated with covid19 im really pleased with the results for the third quarter fixed income generated record revenues and pretax income pcg assets in feebased accounts increased sequentially and we continue to recruit numerous highquality financial advisors reaching a new record of up over june of we recruited financial advisors domestically during this quarter alone which represents million of trailing production at their prior firms all of this during the pandemic and with our offices closed for much of that period we are also entering the fourth quarter of a healthy investment banking pipeline even with these market changes and uncertainty we are continuing to focus on servicing our advisors and clients and growing all of our businesses we generated quarterly net revenue of billion which was down as compared to prior years fiscal third quarter and compared to the preceding quarter the yearoveryear decline in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by the impact of shortterm interest rates as we all know both on net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks sequentially quarterly net revenues declined due to both shortterm interest rates and lower asset management and related administrative fees which were primarily based in the private client group entering the quarter with feebased accounts so lower we generated quarterly net income of million or per diluted share which was down compared to net income in the prior years fiscal third quarter largely due to the bank loan loss provision of million during the quarter compared to a million benefit in the prior years fiscal third quarter raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 despite a sequential decline in quarterly pretax income net income increased sequentially as significant non taxable gains in the corporateowned life insurance portfolio reduced the effective tax rate to for the quarter from in the preceding quarter on an annualized basis our return on equity for the quarter was and return on tangible common equity or rotce was moving to slide as equity markets rebounded from the march lows client assets under administration grew sequentially to billion and pcg assets in feebased accounts grew to sequentially to a near record billion which will provide significant tailwinds for asset management fees in the fiscal fourth quarter following the surge in march client cash balances remained relatively stable ending the quarter at billion and despite the continued disruption caused by travel restrictions and office closures we reached a record number of pcg financial advisors of over june of and over march of this is a good result compared to many firms which experienced a net decline we accomplished this despite many of these offices being closed during the quarter and weve had many advisors commit push their commitment dates back waiting for the offices to reopen net bank loans of billion grew over the prior years fiscal third quarter but declined compared to the preceding quarter the sequential decline includes proactive sales of corporate loans totaling million which well discuss in more detail in the call the bank continued to experience healthy growth in residential mortgages and securitybased lending to our private client group clients moving to segment results starting on the slide the private client group generated quarterly net revenues of billion quarterly net revenues declined compared to prior years fiscal third quarter and primarily due to lower rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks a decline in net interest income and lower brokerage revenues the sequential decline in quarterly net revenues was attributable to the aforementioned items as well as lower asset management fees and related administrative fees which were primarily based on private client group assets and feebased accounts being lower at the beginning in the quarter quarterly pretax income for the segment was down million down on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially pcg assets increased along with the equity markets and while recruited production increased sequentially the net addition of financial advisors was negatively impacted by the covid19 crisis which disrupted a lot of the transitions particularly in the employee channel due to office closures and slowed the net addition of trainees as testing centers were closed during the quarter but are now open its also important to note that in the net number a number of advisors leaving for retirements leaving the industry or moving to a ria channel affect the total net advisor count but weve retained almost all of those assets during those transitions the net advisory growth in the independent channel remains strong and is tracking closely with our fiscal results as home office visits for perspective advisors have transitioned to to virtual advisor recruiting activity has continue to recover and the pipeline remains solid across all of our affiliation options over the past four quarters financial advisors representing approximately million of trailing productions and nearly billion of assets with our prior firms have affiliated with raymond james domestically which is a very strong result moving to slide the capital markets segment generated record revenues driven by higher fixed income brokerage revenues debt underwriting revenues which more than offset lower ma revenues the year overyear increase in fixed income brokerage revenues and the record results for our fixed income really reflect raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 our leading position in the small to midsized depository client segment which has experienced an increase in activity meanwhile ma revenues declined due to economic uncertainty and decreased activity across certain industries however clients remain engaged and the fourth quarter pipeline looks good on the next slide the asset management segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million during the quarter financial assets under management grew to billion increases of on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially primarily attributable to the higher equity markets as the sp index appreciated during the quarter which was partially offset by net outflows for carillon tower advisers on slide raymond james bank generated net revenues of million or decline from the preceding quarter largely attributable to the 73basispoint decline in the banks net interest margin during the quarter reflecting the rapid and significant decline of libor pretax income of million declined to the prior fiscal third quarter and was flat sequentially the yearoveryear decline in the pretax income was primarily due to the million bank loan loss provision during the quarter on slide we can look at the history of raymond james banks key credit metrics during the financial crisis you can see that raymond james bank consistent with the entire banking industry enjoyed several years of positive credit trends since the financial crisis while nonperforming assets declined during the quarter net chargeoffs were million including million related to proactive sales of corporate loans during the quarter the other million of chargeoffs were attributable to one corporate loan the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased to from in the preceding quarter and for the corporate portfolios the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of ci loans ended the quarter at and for cre loans if economic conditions continue to deteriorate we would expect adding to these reserves but certainly the outlook is uncertain looking at the fiscal yeartodate results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion during the first nine months of the fiscal up over the same period private client group capital markets and asset management segments generated record net revenues and capital markets and asset management segments generated record pretax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year again these results highlight the advantage of our diverse complementary businesses earnings per diluted share of declined compared to the first nine months of fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates and higher bank loan loss provisions and now for more detailed review of the financials im going to turn it over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks paul starting with revenues on slide as paul stated we generated quarterly net revenues of billion which are down on a yearoveryear and sequentially ill touch on a few of the revenue line items asset management fees were down on a yearoveryear and sequentially commensurate with the sequential decrease in feebased assets in the technical difficulty to the fiscal third quarter which will be reflected in the fourth quarter as these assets are built at the beginning of each quarter based on balances at the end of the preceding quarter but remember the asset management line is also driven by financial assets under management which increased sequentially raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 account and service fees of million declined yearoveryear and sequentially primarily reflecting the decrease in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks due to lower shortterm interest rates which ill detail shortly and jumping down to other revenues they were up substantially from the preceding quarter as the second quarter included valuation losses of million associated with our private equity investments largely due to the equity market decline last quarter moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for interest earning assets and the balances with thirdparty banks that generate rjbdp fees ended the quarter at billion representing of domestic pcg client assets as client assets increased substantially while cash balances remained relatively stable throughout the quarter following the surge in march and as weve mentioned on the prior quarters call weve shifted about billion of cash balances from raymond james bank to thirdparty banks in april but as we look forward we will likely redeploy a portion of these balances back to the bank over time as we plan on continuing purchases of agencybacked securities which ended the quarter at billion and we will also resume corporate loan growth when there is less market uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic on slide the top chart displays our firm wide net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks on a combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by changes in shortterm interest rates as you can see the rate cuts totaling basis points since august of have put significant pressure on these revenue streams which on a combined basis are down million compared to the prior years fiscal third quarter despite loan growth at raymond james bank and a significant yearoveryear increase in client cash balances given that these revenues are not directly compensable the significant decline has created headwinds for a compensation ratio and pretax margins as we will discuss on the next few slides on the bottom of slide it shows our banks nim decreasing to this quarter this sequential decline was predominantly caused by the rapid decline in libor which is about lower now than it was during the last earnings call based on libor at the current level we would expect the banks nim to decline to to over the next quarter or two which will also be impacted by how quickly we grow the securities portfolio at raymond james bank on the bottom right portion of the slide you can see that the average yields on rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks fell to an average of basis points during the quarter as we expected we would expect average yields to remain close to basis points over the nearterm so when we think about bank nim going forward as we shift more cash from thirdparty banks to raymond james bank to technical difficulty even though we would earn more on a consolidated basis for example today we earn around basis points with thirdparty banks as i just described and we are earning around on new securities purchases at the bank so somewhere around a 65basispoint pickup for the firm net of fdic insurance expense but of course we are taking some duration risk and tying up some capital in return for that benefit moving on to expenses on slide first compensation expense which is by far our largest expense the compensation ratio increased sequentially from to during the quarter the compensation ratio was negatively impacted by a higher proportion of compensable revenues as lower interest rates negatively impacted the noncompensable revenue streams we discussed on the last slide partially offsetting that negative impact was a lower compensation ratio in the capital markets segment thanks to very strong fixed income brokerage revenues raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 on to noncompensation expenses noncompensation expenses during the quarter of million decreased sequentially due to a lower loan loss provision and lower business development expenses as travel and conferences were halted by covid19 taking a step back for a moment when we entered the year we were wellpositioned for market and economic disruptions and continued to effectively serve advisors and clients throughout the pandemic and resulting economic disruption our success weathering this difficult period has been enabled by the significant investments in our infrastructure over the past several years however the unexpected swing in interest rates and the uncertainty that comes with a global recession require us to evaluate ways to reduce costs and find efficiencies to remain wellpositioned for future growth and success to that end we are currently engaged in a firmwide process of evaluating both compensation and non compensation expenses to improve efficiency while maintaining our high service standards importantly we plan to continue making growth investments during this period for example by recruiting financial advisors and other revenue generating producers we also continue investing in our support platform robotic automation and integrated and paperless processes to continue enhancing the advisorclient experience based on lessons learned during this crisis we also anticipate our real estate needs will evolve as we consider more flexible strategies over the longterm so while we are far along in this process we are not prepared to provide any efficiency targets guidance or timelines on the call today but the goal is for these initiatives to yield significant efficiencies for the firm which is critical so that we can continue investing in growth slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters pretax margin was in the fiscal third quarter of negatively impacted by lower shortterm interest rates and the large bank loan loss provisions on slide at the end of the fiscal third quarter total assets were approximately billion declining sequentially this decrease was primarily attributable to shifting client cash balances from the bank to thirdparty banks following the surge in march as i discussed earlier our liquidity remains very strong cash at the parent was more than billion and we also have an undrawn million unsecured committed revolver which doesnt mature until so right now we have about billion of excess cash at the parent over our conservative targets but we are intentionally maintaining even more cash than we typically hold given in the high degree of market uncertainty so with cash at the parent of more than billion a total capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of we have substantial amounts of capital liquidity with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters where we returned approximately million back to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the boards authorization share buybacks have been suspended since midmarch and million remains available under the boards previously disclosed repurchase authorization with our strong capital and liquidity position we plan on maintaining our current dividend and we also likely will resume share repurchases of up to million per quarter just to offset the sharebased compensation dilution but we will still wait for more market clarity before we do a larger amount of opportunistic repurchases on the next two slides we provide additional detail on the banks loan portfolio slide provides some detail on raymond james banks asset composition in the pie chart you can see we have a really welldiversified portfolio raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 with a focus over the past few years to really grow residential mortgages and securitiesbased loans to private client group clients as well as significantly increase the size of the securities portfolio we have not yet set a new target but we do plan on continuing purchases of these securities which are mostly agencybacked so we have a much more diversified portfolio now than we did before the last financial crisis and within each category we have a significant amount of diversification as well as you can see on this slide as we talk about on the next slide our concentration in some of these covid exposed industries have decreased sequentially as we proactively sold certain loans this slide includes some other facts and statistics on other loan categories but in summary we feel good about the banks loan portfolio with that being said it is important to remember that we are still in the middle of a global pandemic so as confident as we are about the composition of the loan portfolio and our loan underwriting and monitoring processes we have to acknowledge that we could experience significant credit deterioration if economic conditions continue to deteriorate moving on to slide during the quarter we opportunistically sold million of corporate loans associated with industries that we believe are most vulnerable to the covid19 crisis having a secondary market to proactively reduce credit exposures is a real advantage of our ci lending strategy the average selling price of these loans was round of par value which resulted in chargeoffs of million during the quarter but we believe proactively taking that hit to reduce our credit exposure and downside in the most vulnerable sectors over the longterm is prudent given the high degree of economic uncertainty we plan to continue selectively selling corporate loans in the secondary market to further reduce our exposure to certain sectors thus far in july we have sold approximately million of corporate loans in these sectors at an average price of of par value as prices in the secondary market have continued to improve significantly before i turn it over to paul for his closing comments i want to remind everyone that after much consideration we postponed the analyst investor day again given the continued economic and market uncertainty around the covid19 it makes it difficult for us to provide much be meaningful forwardlooking commentary so we do not want to waste your time however we know analysts and investors have been asking us to disclose net new assets and since we ph intend on providing that at our analyst investor day ill go ahead and cover that now as you can imagine technology priorities have shifted significantly since the covid pandemic but we have been able to make some good progress on this metric thanks to the fantastic team working on it but itll still take us some more work before we would consider providing this metric on a regular basis we define net new assets as total domestic again domestic pcg client inflows which includes financial advisor recruiting less total domestic pcg client outflows inflows also include dividend reinvestments and interest while outflows include commissions and feebased payments fiscal yeartodate we have generated net new assets of billion an annualized growth rate of we believe this impressive result even during the covid pandemic reinforces that raymond james is one of the industrys leaders in growing organically with that ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 great thanks paul and i know theres a lot to cover on this call so ill get through a little outlook and well open for questions so as for the outlook we will continue to face headwinds from lower shortterm interest rates and the uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic in the private client group our financial advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options and the segments going to benefit by starting the fiscal fourth quarter with a sequential increase of assets and feebased accounts and just to note in that recruiting that weve had a lot of people who have committed much earlier in the march april may timeframe who have deferred their openings and moving before they joined because of the pandemic so hopefully those will show up this coming quarter also in the capital markets segment despite muted ma activity in the fiscal third quarter clients remain engaged and we have a pretty healthy investment banking pipeline so we wouldnt be surprised to see an improvement in the ma revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter if the market remains relatively stable and fixed income and brokerage revenues have remained strong thus far in july so its always difficult to repeat the record like last quarter but we view them to be very very another strong quarter for that segment again given the market trends in asset management results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management as long as the equity market continues to remain resilient and at raymond james bank we expect nim to decline as paul said from the fiscal third quarter is somewhere around between and over the next two quarters reflecting current libor rates and a higher mix of agencybacked securities now remember when we move cash from our thirdparty banks to the bank and agencybacked securities the bank nim will go down but well generate overall for the firm higher interest income and therefore we think it represents an attractive risk adjusted return for the firm we are continuing to sell certain corporate loans as paul mentioned and weve been very selective in making new corporate loans given the high degree of uncertainty but were continuing to do some new corporate loans but continuing to originate residential and securitiesbased loans to our private client group clients we have significant capacity and appetite to resume corporate loan growth when we have more economic certainty with our substantial amount of capital and liquidity we are confident in our ability to withstand a severe downturn while being opportunistic and frontfooted as things stabilize our growth opportunities remain unchanged always retaining and recruiting organically financial advisors in our private client group and as youve heard from paul a few minutes ago our organic private client group domestic annualized net new asset growth of has been strong despite the covid challenges additionally we are committing and continue to add senior talent in other businesses such as investment banking we also continue to pursue acquisitions actively economic softness typically surfaces attractive acquisitions as it was during morgan keegan in a little more complicated by covid and traveling and those kind of issues i also want to address social unrest following the tragic death of george floyd during the quarter at raymond james weve always been a firm focused on social justice and being a good home for all associates and advisors regardless of their race gender or sexual orientation but the recent social unrest really emphasized the need for us to be even more vocal in public with our advocacy we just didnt want to write a check but rather wanted to use financial commitments to activate our associates to really make a difference so that and in addition to our financial commitment we released a pledge to the black community which was signed not just by me but all members of our executive committee our operating committee and our board of directors as well as many other associates across the firm raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 one major component of that pledge is to increase black diversity throughout the firm which will require significant effort that we know will not be achieved overnight but we are absolutely committed to delivering on this pledge and i just want to thank our leadership team our black financial advisors network and our mosaic inclusion network group for all their contributions and those to the so many associates whove raised their hand and say i want to help to make a difference before we open the lines for questions i just want to add i believe we are wellpositioned with our diversified business mix longterm focus and conservative principles to really emerge from this pandemic with our strong capital and liquidity positions we are proactively pursuing strategic acquisitions with a consistent and disciplined approach lastly i want to thank all of our associates and our advisors again for their invaluable contributions during these trying times and their focus on serving clients with that operator you can open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from devin ryan of jmp securities please proceed with your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning everyone paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc first question here just on the net interest income outlook if we can maybe the next couple of years if we were to hold libor steady i appreciate the nim is going to see pressure just on the remixing of the bank thats going to be i think partially a function of how fast the securities book rose and so im just trying to think about parameters around how much you would move from thirdparty banks and how quickly how much as we look beyond maybe even the upcoming quarter the corporate book could shrink further and then are there other loan areas that could grow reasonably that could maybe provide a little bit of an offset on the nim like residential mortgages or something else paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 yeah well its going to be hard to provide guidance over the next one or two years devin but at least for the next one or two quarters we think the guidance of nim of to is our best guess right now based on where libor is we havent set a new target yet for how much were willing to grow the securities portfolio theres a lot of variables there and frankly making a total shift in asset strategy in the middle of a global pandemic is probably not the right time to do it with all of the moving parts cash has been resilient client cash balances are actually still billion now roughly even after income tax payments and the fee billing in early july or midjuly but that could change tomorrow so certainly not willing to go out one to two years but as far as the corporate loan growth goes it was down i think million net during the quarter we sold million worth but there was also a lot of net pay downs and we remain very selective in making new corporate loans but as we get more market clarity we certainly have an appetite and the expertise to grow that portfolio and we can do it pretty rapidly if the market conditions get better so again a lot of moving parts cant go out one to two years but at least over the next one or two quarters we think to nim is as good as it gets as we have right now devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc got it paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc let me just add the one thing i know you understand this stuff but as we do move more from bdp to the bank the nim may have a little compression but our overall net interest income will be up will pick up plus basis points on that move net of insurance so the nim may be down but overall net interest income will be up given todays environment so thats the reason we would do it we think its a good risk adjusted return devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc right and just a clarification because i know historically theres been parameters around the amount of cash youre comfortable having essentially liquid and with thirdparty banks with a short duration versus in the bank which historically was more of a loancentric bank and so as youre building more of a securities portfolio and growing that are you more comfortable just given the more liquid nature of the securities to kind of i guess go beyond historical parameters around the mix of cash held outside the firm paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean i think paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah and i think you can see that sorry go ahead paul paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 yeah i mean i think so we grew the securities portfolio net over billion this quarter last time we were in zero rate environment we had almost no securities at all so our appetite for some duration has increased but were still going to be more exposed to the shorter end of the curve which is appropriate given our deposits are floating rate deposits for the most part and so well continue moving deposits from thirdparty banks to the banks balance sheet but we want to do it in a way that technical difficulty devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah okay great got it okay thanks paul a quick followup here just on the expense process that you guys announced here you went through some of the areas that youre going to kind of continue to invest in and areas that you want to kind of hold expenses it sounds like in do you have any high level thoughts right now just around some of the areas where some of those efficiencies could exist within comp or noncomp and then just any thoughts on timing around the conclusion and execution of it paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc like i said were not prepared to provide any timelines on todays call were far along in the process and really were looking at almost every single expense line item both compensation and noncompensation expenses devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia of morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i was wondering so if we look at your pretax margins for this quarter and exclude the elevated provision number indiscernible roughly a number for this quarter and then maybe there is another or so of headwind from additional nim pressure that you see is that a good way of thinking about your longterm pretax margins as a starting point in this rate environment and then maybe as were modeling it ph take in some benefit from the expense initiatives that youre looking at paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think in fairness we also had subdued business development expenses this quarter i think they were down something like million yearoveryear this is typically the quarter where we hit our high watermark just given the timing of our recognition events and conferences so theres some offsets and also capital markets generated i think a pretax margin which is a very high margin thanks to the record fixed income results so there are some puts and takes again were not ready to provide given the uncertainty in these moving parts a longterm margin target but we are focused on those expense efficiencies as well as you said raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and i guess on the provision side can you give us an update on how youre thinking about provisions of the bank and i know you mentioned that you could have a little bit more of a build if the environment deteriorates but if it doesnt are you comfortable with where the reserve levels are at the bank right now and i know youre not accounting on cecl yet but maybe if you can give any initial guidance on what do you think the cecl trueup will look like at the end of next quarter paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc we try to be as proactive as we can as we always do with reserving the loans for the loans at the bank so we feel good about our allowances now at especially in the corporate portfolio ci is allowance and the cre portfolio is a allowance so with that being said if economic conditions continue to deteriorate then some of the stimulus measures which are temporary in nature dont get extended and who knows whats going to happen so theres certainly potential for more allowances across the entire industry but at this juncture we just dont know right now so cecl goes into effect october 1st frankly i dont even know what our provision is going to be in the september quarter under our existing methodology so we really arent in a position to provide much guidance under cecl yet paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say i would add one thing is that you have to recognize too most financial institutions havent been selling loans so if you were to take the sales of those loans instead of selling them just put a reserve against them our reserves wouldve been much higher so weve been proactively derisking areas that we think in the transportation and hospitality and gaming in areas we think are have more exposure weve been actively reducing risk but again had we just followed what most of the industry did our reserves would have even been higher so we think for where we are weve done a good job of trying to stay up in the front but again it just depends on the outlook in a steady state we wouldnt be adding if the economy gets worse we will add so were just going to have to watch and its just too unpredictable right now manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven chubak of wolfe research please proceed with your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 hi steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with just a question paul on the strategy regarding loan portfolio sales and as we look ahead how large is the remaining pool of loans that you are looking to evaluate for a potential sale if you could just speak to the time line also for when youd look to execute those and whether the increase in criticized loans that we saw in the quarter is that whats driving at least a decision to execute on some of those or whats the i guess the prevailing factors that are driving the strategy there paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so probably not a shock for most people that raymond james has taken a whole different approach as we just look at the industries that we think are very coviddependent and set on a risk reward basis there are loans that we are in certain industries were just not comfortable that we think theres more downside than upside so one way to do it is just increase your reserves and increase your criticized loans on your balance sheet and just ride through it but that also limits your flexibility both regulatorily and the drag longterm and on those highly risk areas are the ones we decided just to lighten our exposure and so thats been our strategy if those loans perform better and some of these industries dont go through prolonged bankruptcy restructurings we will have made a bad long term bet if the case is that theyre very long restructurings its going to be a tough indiscernible we made a good bet and we are willing to do that in what we viewed were the most atrisk industries so were looking we have a list of about another million of loans again the markets been good thats why we lightened indiscernible whether we would do those or go more i dont know were evaluating that as we go and looking at the pricing risk longterm versus reserves kind of tradeoffs and once again had we just added them to the reserves wed be more flexible but we think its the right thing to do from a risk structure basis so we started out of the box quickly weve slowed down a little bit but were still looking steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc indiscernible paul and just a followup from me regarding the securities portfolio i was hoping you could give us some sense as to how we should think about the potential pace of additional purchases i know youve been reluctant to commit to that but also just given your historical reluctance i would say to take on additional duration risk why the willingness to take this on now during this covid environment when the incremental spread between taking on that additional duration risk on an agency security versus what youre earning offbalance sheet at basis points is actually relatively low relative to prior historical periods paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah well we have a significant amount of cash with thirdparty banks now billion so we have more capacity now than weve had historically and frankly the demand at thirdparty banks is continuing to evolve there was a significant demand in march when there was a lot of revolver fundings and that dynamic has changed as you know and so that demand is not as strong as it was in march raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 and so were willing to take some duration not as much duration as many of our peers but were willing to take some incremental duration for that yield pickup but we havent again set a glide path just yet but were comfortable with that taking on some more duration and we certainly we hope were wrong but we certainly dont think that shortterm rates are going to increase anytime soon especially after hearing powell again yesterday so again hopefully were wrong because were still going to be much more exposed to the short end of the curve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just one quick followup if i may just on the noncomps you delivered a positive surprise there given the lower indiscernible and other expense we have been seeing similar trends at peers so putting aside the future expense initiatives i know youre not ready to speak to how should we think about the appropriate jumping off point for that noncomp exprovision base recognizing that te conference spend is going to be on pause for a sustained period of time paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah well excluding the kind of elevated provisions we were guiding to about million per quarter for this fiscal year and obviously weve been well below that excluding the provisions largely due to as you mentioned lower business development expenses we want that we expect that to go up over time not next quarter but as soon as people are more comfortable traveling we expect business development expenses to increase but one of the things that were looking at as part of our overall expense initiatives is weve learned that a lot of our advisors are perfectly comfortable and happy doing some of these regional workshops and other product focused sessions virtually versus physically in person at various locations across the country so the private client group leadership team is also looking at this as a longterm opportunity to certainly transition to more virtual events as well which could help business development expenses so again were looking closely at the longterm opportunities coming out of this crisis paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah but itd be a mistake to think theyre all going away the conferences or get togethers there the educational trips for the top advisors are all part of our culture and our ability to have feedback with our advisors so going forward i think that well find theres a lot of trips why would i take this two day trip lets do it virtually but some of those conferences we do anticipate coming back when its safe to do so steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc its great thanks so much for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris harris of wells fargo please proceed with your question christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 thanks guys paul you mentioned a reinvestment rate around basis points for agency mbs today is it fair to assume thats ultimately where the yield on the entire securities book will go assuming static rates and if so when will you expect that to occur over what timeframe paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean we have an average duration of the securities we buy is roughly three years and so the existing books has an average yield of about and id say the average life on the existing book remaining life is probably two to three years because again the vintage is relatively new of the portfolio as weve grown it so it will take some time for that reinvestment yield to sort of reset as we add securities christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it okay and just one quick question on the asset management segment those revenues were down sequentially and i know it is a volatile quarter in terms of aum moving around but that decline seems to be more than potentially average aum decline so is there something else thats going on in that segment that dropped the revenues a bit paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc that aum chris includes both institutional assets under management as well as retail assets under management so i would say roughly of those assets are built based on the beginning of the period assets so you cant just look at it on an average basis so thats whats driving the variance that youre describing christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jim mitchell of seaport global please proceed with your question james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning guys just maybe a quick question on capital management i understand the uncertainty is holding you back but how do you think what are the markers youre looking for is it just do we have to wait for a vaccine for you to feel comfortable putting capital to work what are the markers i guess or is there macro markers that youre looking at and i guess as a ancillary does that also mean that youre as much as you want to do acquisitions youre holding back to put capital to work there until you have clarity as well paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so i think in order of we would have no qualms whatsoever doing an acquisition if we had the right one so we think we have plenty of capital and ability to do an acquisition for the right one and integrate it so we dont see thats not an issue in terms of stock buybacks we agreed that our goal is to go ahead and minimize dilution and restart that program but i think both given the uncertainty and honestly even you have political and regulatory pressure right now in stock buybacks we dont think its just really prudent to start that yet raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 but more importantly driven by the economics if we do enter into a second round of covid issues like were seeing in the south if we do have a really really tough winter we may need those so if were buying or producing asset were very comfortable doing that but were just going to be a little more conservative on outside of dilution doing proactive stock buybacks in this pandemic time so whether thats the vaccine or ceiling trailing off or people getting comfortable with the operating environment i cant say its one of those things i think well know when we feel it but i cant give you an objective this is the answer james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats helpful and then just maybe on the compensation in pcg when i look at sort of fa compensation to compensable revenues the percentage did seem to drop quite a bit in the quarters which was a little surprising am i just not thinking about that right is there something unusual there just trying to get a sense of that sustainable in terms of the lower payout paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc no the im not sure we could speak offline on how that james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc how youre doing the math but the payout is still right around so its been pretty stable sequentially james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay well talk offline thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of alex blostein of goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking the question just a couple of followups i guess if you look at the loan book can you guys talk about the size of loans that you are ultimately evaluating for sales i know you sold million and you sold another million so far this quarter but whats the total amount of risk to your loans that you are looking to potentially sell what are the yields on those loans and maybe you can talk a little bit about how these loans ultimately made their way on to your balance sheet whether these were originated or purchased paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 yeah so again i said we had about another million that we were looking at selling and again these are risk reward these were loans that are syndicated loans and in january we had a indiscernible the lenders dont think so we get them to show go through the loan portfolio the most leveraged the least performing and we really once a year do an evening on each section of the portfolio and indiscernible through what i call its almost like a flight simulator we try to crash the pilot to see what they do we really go through and push really hard how are these loans how are they underwritten and ill tell you i felt as good as i have in years about the underwriting i think they were underwritten well they were strong what we didnt underwrite them for was a pandemic and places having zero revenue in january we didnt say the airlines werent going to fly or nobody was going to fly and no one was going to travel and hotels were going to shut down and restaurants were going to shut down so its those areas those loans i think the underwriting is strong its just we had a circumstance weve never seen in recent years probably almost in the country so thats how they got on to the balance sheet so i dont blame our team i think they were very conservative were just in a very very unusual time as paul said one of the advantages of the loans we did have is they were marked we were able to sell them at of par the last million and then some of those loans have reserves on top so the loss of selling is even less than that it might be or basis points so we just viewed the tradeoff in the risk so that next million we sold is more worth its much more worth to take the loss now than to hold on to the risk and hope that they would turn around in what most people think is going to be a longer haul in the pandemic so the yield is i think is comparable to the rest of the loan portfolio they werent the highest yielding loans they were when underwritten some of them were lower yielding loans they were at high credits in industries that just got hit really hard in the pandemic paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think just the range of the yield is somewhere around libor plus to libor plus the loans that we sold in that kind of range alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc right that makes sense i guess my question ultimately is is the million that you mentioned is that a cleanup and its kind of down or are you guys will be looking to sell down one paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah were opened to selling down i think what weve done is weve looked at the loans that we were most concerned of and they were really more concerned about the industry in some places the credits we were aggressive on very quickly i think the loans now are almost opportunistic as loan pricing recovered we said we could get these credits off of our balance sheet with almost no loss and we decided to go ahead and do that so theyre more opportunistic and again we have million that were looking at weve done million and it doesnt say we will do the million it doesnt say we wont do more well do an evaluation and again weve made a handful of new loans too because wed like the industrys spreads and the risks so we just havent raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 opened up widely but we are still opened on originating in the corporate portfolio too but were just a lot more critical to make sure we think those are good loans given in the environment alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay makes sense perfect and just a quick followup thanks for the net new asset disclosure very good to see you guys get that out there i guess when you talk about the pipeline and the strong momentum you continue to have in recruiting can you talk a little about the mix and how the mix might have changed between the employee channel given the kind of the work from home dynamics and the independent channel so as youre looking out the next months and the assets that are going to come in into raymond james how does that mix compare to historical employee versus independent levels paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah during the quarter it was much stronger in the independent channel and the reason is most of them have their own branches and offices so there is no reason to put off a move they can change honestly sometimes its actually easier right now because clients are at home you can find them to do the transition so that has been more robust in the core than the employee channel having said that the recruiting in the employee channel and the commits have been good but a lot of them have delayed because we shut our offices and were now in the limited reopening limiting the number of people in the branches and so we now have on a voluntary basis so we now have the offices open where people join indiscernible like we announced this week and another one the week before so we do have people joining but we have an awful lot of people that have decided to put off their joins and a lot of them till september now and some of these have been signed up since april may june they said theyre coming but they just dont want to transition till they feel that theyre in a comfortable spot to the pandemic so thats the so i think the employer side will do a little catching up once people feel comfortable about going into an office alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks guys thanks for taking all the questions operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chris allen of compass point please proceed with your question chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc morning guys most of my questions have been answered just a quick one on the fixed ph strength you noted continuing into july on the brokerage side i mean most of the areas we look at seems like things are slowing down a little bit so maybe if you can just give us some color there how your business is holding up from a market share perspective as well would be helpful thanks paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 so i think that there was a rush in fixed income both in repositioning and frankly for credit underwriting debt underwriting and so i think youve seen that slow down a little bit but a lot we have a very leading position with small and midsized banks so as loan activity has kind of slowed down they have been investing more in securities and redoing their securities so although i think were not if you ask me to guess itd be hard to repeat last quarters record its always hard to repeat a record but i think its going to be very strong fixed income for us and all signs so far show its very strong so we expect another good quarter and we anticipate just on closings that capital markets that the ma transactions will be up but you never know for closings for an ma deal we can guess all you want even with a good pipeline its when they close and what gets in the way so we feel pretty good about that segment for this quarter and then in the private client group segment and asset management since the assets are pegged i mean that should be a pretty good quarter too in terms of revenue increases for those chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc thanks guys thats it for me operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler of credit suisse please proceed with your question craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc good morning everyone and hope youre all well and staying healthy i wanted to start off with recruiting do you have the number of gross or net number of financial advisors added in each of the months in the june quarter and if you dont could you provide any commentary on how recruiting trended in the quarter as you adapted to the virtual recruiting backdrop paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah were not going to provide monthly or we of course track that internally but havent provided that externally yet what i would tell you is what paul said is that the recruiting momentum really rebounded throughout the quarter as weve adjusted to our virtual home office visits and we are all doing pauls doing them and im doing them the home office visits virtually and theyre going pretty well so we feel really good about the activity levels again across all our affiliation options but yeah arent going to provide monthtomonth statistics on those craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks paul and just one followup on reserving can you provide us some color or at least what to expect from the cecl loan loss reserve bill thats coming in the october quarter i think seasonally this one may be different than the others and im just interested in the underlying process relative to the reserve that was just build in both the march and the june quarter paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 yeah and again we still have another quarter under the incurred loss process for provisions and we dont even know what thats going to be yet so well have to wait and see i know that even for the big banks the macro assumptions are changing rapidly so to technical difficulty the macro assumptions and projections are going to look like even in october it seems like its right around the corner but every week things change dramatically so well wait and see kind of how things progress between now and then craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thank you paul paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think that the problem with the problem with cecl is that the macros change all the time i mean if you took a point in time today where you wouldnt see a huge change but you dont know right so that could change tomorrow but right now instantaneous if we did it today we dont think thered be a huge change craig siegenthaler q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you operator and our final question for today comes from the line of william katz of citi please proceed with your question q hi everyone this is actually ph zoe speaking on behalf of william katz so thank you for taking the question so would just appreciate some more color on july like any kind of initial color on client engagement metrics and flows paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah thanks for the question its a pretty broad one in terms of the client engagement across our businesses as paul said in his outlook comments in the private client group business the feebased assets should provide us a tailwind for asset management revenues and recruiting activity remains healthy in capital markets segment the ma pipeline entering into the fourth quarter looks good we expect ma revenues to be up assuming that the market environment remains relatively resilient here through the rest of the quarter and the fixed income activity hard to repeat a record as paul said the depository client segment in particular remains very engaged so we feel good about the client activity levels but well provide more details as we go along here q okay thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30jul2020 paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay then i would just like to thank you all for participating i know that your jobs are hard given so many extraneous market factors and the pandemic and everything else and working remotely so i know its harder for all of us but we really appreciate you taking the time well try to provide as much color as we can and hopefully get an analyst day scheduled as soon as we can as we get a little more color for this next month or so so thank you very much for joining us paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc
