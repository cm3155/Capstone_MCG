quarter before i turn the call over to brian and paul let me just remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements and refer to nongaap financial measures during the call regarding various elements of the financial results our forwardlooking statements are based on managements current expectations and assumptions that are subject to bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1

the sec filings that are on our website information about the nongaap financial measures including reconciliations to us gaap can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website so with that i will turn it over to you brian take it away brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and thank all of you for joining us its been a year since we first reported our results which would include the health crisis impact but what we see different now is we see an accelerating recovery versus the economic uncertainty that we would have faced the last year at this time the most recent economic indicators reflect that an economic recovery that is gaining momentum and continues to be supported by fiscal monetary policies from our companys perspective we have emerged as an even stronger company and competitor than what we were when we entered the health care crisis compared to last year bank of americas balance sheet has higher capital ratios higher reserves but lower chargeoffs and record liquidity our diverse business model with leadership positions across all our businesses has helped us earn our way through the crisis our global markets and global wealth management businesses which would typically benefit from this healthy capital markets environment continued to perform well this quarter our consumer and global banking businesses also performed well but this is after being more negatively impacted for several quarters by the interest rate environment and credit cards these businesses now are in full recovery mode and are out generating new assets and new relationship with our clients all this work by my team in which were very proud of here has led to eps in the first quarter of per share and a return on tangible common equity of paul is going to take you through the details in a moment but simply put we believe our decade plus long dedication to responsible growth has put us in a position to both earn more money and deliver more back to you our shareholders our announcement this morning regarding share repurchases highlights our intention to increase those repurchases over the coming quarters as the current restrictions are lifted by the federal reserve but first lets discuss the recovering economy on slides and we shared slides like this with you the last few quarters they are updated with the most quarterly data they highlight the key economic signposts i wont go through all the details on them but they are there for your reference but a few highlights obviously gdp consensus projections continue to improve and you can see our tremendous bestinclass bank of america research teams projections in the upper left hand corner of slide you will note also the increases in the consumer spending from our bank of america customers at the bottom of the slide which is not only much higher than the prior year when payments began declining but notably is much higher this yeartodate than yeartodate a more appropriate comparison this is a key element of the economic optimism youre seeing reflected in the market looking back to after tax reform and other matters we saw a step change in money movement by our customers moving from previously a yearover year type of growth rate to up to in versus then the pandemic hit and growth of over was only but so far yeartodate were growing faster on a larger base than the 9plus growth trend at plus bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 the first quarter was a record dollar amount of money moved by bank of america consumers the trend is fully on track even though the economy has not yet fully reopened march was a record month of spending by bank of america consumers and led to the highest ever quarter of consumer spend as you look also on the slides note on slide the lower level of card delinquencies has a spike from the expired deferrals and the indiscernible has worked its way through the chargeoffs in addition earlystage delinquencies are at or near historic lows suggesting low levels of card chargeoffs again next year or next quarter excuse me as the economy has improved customers have continued to increase their business across our platform when you think about it from the customers perspective which is what we do as a business and comparing across the pandemic period of last months we have simply added more customers across every line of business and those customers are more digitally engaged in every business as well youre going to see later on slide that we added nearly million active digital customers this quarter pushing us past million active users led by increased use by boomers and seniors we have more deposit and cash management customers and balances in every business from consumer to small business to merrill lynch to private bank the business bank and the commercial bank across all franchises new investment relationships in our consumer businesss merrill lynch platform now total more than million accounts and net new households continue to grow in both merrill lynch and the private bank we saw aggregated client flows across our investment platforms of billion in the quarter bringing those total investment assets to over trillion with the range of those capabilities from our digitalonly capabilities in our consumer business all the way through the great service and capabilities provided by our wealth advisors we added new lending customers whether through ppp and small business and business banking along with broader traditional banking relationships in our middle market corporate clients and we have helped existing and new clients obtain funding to access market through our sales and trading investment banking platforms combined sales and trading investment banking revenue of billion is the highest in a decade and is up yearoveryear jimmy demare and matthew koder and the teams led by tom montag have done a great job there our customer satisfaction levels across all these groups of clients rose during the pandemic and the brand loyalty of our company is at the highest its been we also note that our employee engagement is the highest its been and we have driven our success to our teammates this quarter and youll note in our expenses with another broadbased bonus plan which is the fourth time weve done this and with support provided to the communities we serve our employees sense of pride in our company and what it does has reached new levels of satisfaction so with that being said we do have some work to do in certain areas as we have for the last decade id highlight those three areas with a couple of comments on each those areas are loan growth net interest income and expense on loan growth there continues to be a lot of liquidity in the system and customer payments remain high which impacts the loan balances and this is across the whole consumers and companies pipeline origination improving but remained below prepandemic levels weve reinstated all our credit standards back to where they were before the pandemic and we remained highly focused on capturing loan growth as the economy expands and continues to recover the projected economic growth should cause the need for companies to borrow build inventory increase hiring and invest and do what they do in their businesses bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 as you can see from slide global banking loans after falling in january appeared to have stabilized again in march well have to see how this plays out but thats the first the month of march was a good sign pipelines continue to build but line usage remains low card applications and mortgage originations continued to increase in each of the last three quarters this along with mortgage rates moving higher and driving lower prepayments and runoff of current mortgage loans sets up consumer loan growth that strong customer liquidity obviously negatively impacts loan growth but is has benefited credit cost we saw quarter one net chargeoffs remaining below prepandemic levels in dollars and percentage further supporting reduction in our credit reserve this quarter now net interest income we told you six months ago that we believed the third quarter would be the trough and has proven to be so despite the drawdown of loans and two less days of interest in this current quarter nii was flat to fourth quarter of last year as we move through we believe the benefits from a steepened interest rate curve should begin to work its way into our revenue driven by continued investment of our liquidity as well as picking up those lost days of interest thinking about the expected nii trajectory this year within the year ahead i would set the stage as follows if the forward interest rate curve materializes and we see modest loan growth in the later quarters of the year we ought to see nii as we exit the fourth quarter of this quarter billion a quarter higher than the most recent level of billion in this quarter the last area i would highlight is expense we had a large expense this quarter driven by several factors some were seasonal impacts some were good news and that they were volume and revenuedriven impacts and others were not typical of our normal operating expense due to the charges taken we expect a significant decline as you look forward to the second quarter of in expense weve seen the head count in our company start to work its way back down due to attrition especially as the specialized programs begin to run their course id also remind you that the first quarter is typically elevated for payroll tax expense and this year was about million next i would say roughly million of our increase is driven by the improved activity and higher revenue which of course is a positive its what were in the business to do the items i classify as differing from our typical costs were as follows first given the progress made in our digital engagement with our customers and other customer traffic behavior we will continue to rationalize real estate for our teammates and our customers and recorded impairment charge due to that of million in the quarter second a portion of the equity awarded for last years work for our global banking markets teammates had a different retirement rule and as previously reported we changed that retirement rule which caused that to accelerate in full this quarter instead of being amortized over the next four years other costs worth noting include severance costs and special incentive award recognizing a broad base of teammates for their outstanding efforts during this pandemic that award for the fourth time is built on shared success awards the three times prior that was given in three previous years additionally covid expense remains elevated as we continue to help our clients through the various assistance programs established by the government ppp unemployment claims stimulus payment disbursement and ppp forgiveness but broadly speaking we have done a great job in helping customers with these programs weve now originated almost ppp loans and have obtained forgiveness for our clients for of those we processed billion unemployment claims and billion in eip stimulus payments paul is going to share a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 bit of the details in the quarters expenses but even after absorbing these expenses our ppnr rose from fourth quarter as we ended last year we talked about a target for this years expenses meaning the fiscal year expenses to be similar to the billion level in given the charges this quarter we would increase that target by about billion however i just want you to keep some perspective here we reported billion in expense for the year six years ago even with all the investments we have made in technology and the buildout of branches and new markets new sales resources and just having more customers more activities the inflation in healthcare and real estate and other costs moving our teammates our starting wages from to an hour during that time period we are targeting expense at roughly to where it was in six years later and a lot bigger company later that discipline and operational excellence is what we do and you should expect us to continue that so in summary this quarter we again drove responsible growth we supported our employees by keeping them safe and rewarding their efforts in the pandemic we supported our customers by providing strong balance sheet and resilient systems to transact we supported our communities by supplying critical funding and driving improvement toward racial and social equality with our increase in our billion commitment to billion weve already delivered over million of that commitment at the same time we delivered to you our shareholders billion in earnings generating return on tangible common equity of and returned billion in capital to the shareholders in the first quarter this shows you we can both deliver for you our shareholders and deliver for our customers our employees and our other stakeholders and society with that let me hand off to paul to cover the quarter in a little more detail paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian good morning and hello everyone im starting on slide and together as ive done in the past few quarters now the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this health crisis rather than yearoveryear in q1 we earned net income of billion or per share which compares to billion or per share in q4 the earnings improvement included strong revenue growth which more than offset higher expense additionally earnings also included a billion reserve release which resulted in a billion provision benefit revenue growth was driven by strong sales and trading results record investment banking fees and record asset management fees in our wealth management business while consumer fees faced the seasonal challenge against elevated q4 holiday spending with respect to returns return on tangible common equity was and roa was basis points moving to the balance sheet on slide the balance sheet expanded billion versus q4 to trillion in total assets deposit growth continued to drive the balance sheet higher deposits grew billion in the quarter and are up billion from q1 note that as deposits continued to grow loans declined billion from q4 we deployed some of this excess liquidity into debt securities which increased billion while cash balances declined billion and reverse repo also fell bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 it is also worth noting that our liquidity portfolio is now more than onethird of our total balance sheet and has surpassed trillion on a periodend basis our global markets balance sheet increased by billion coming off yearend seasonal lows and as customers increased their activity with us note that on an average basis it is only up marginally from the prior year and versus q4 up only billion shareholders equity increased billion earnings were mostly offset by billion in net capital distributions and a decrease in oci of billion driven by increase in long bond rates with respect to regulatory ratios consistent with the fourth quarter standardized remains our binding approach for us and at our cet1 ratio is our binding metric while the cet1 ratio declined basis points from q4 it is basis points above our minimum requirement of which translates into a billion capital cushion the benefits to the ratio from an increased level of capital were more than offset by higher rwa from the liquidity deployed into mortgagebacked securities and growth in our global markets balance sheet our supplemental ratio at quarterend was and on a pro forma basis excluding the relief for deposits at the fed and investments in treasuries versus the minimum requirement leaves us plenty of room for growth in the balance sheet our tlac ratio remained comfortably above our requirements let me spend a minute on loans and deposits before moving away from the balance sheet i will focus on averages as that is what drives nii with respect to loans on slide you can see the downward trend across the year as customer liquidity and accommodating capital markets drove paydowns well above historic levels i would draw your attention to the linked quarter change global banking commercial loans declined billion but as brian noted earlier we are seeing pipelines build and balances have stabilized for more than a month so we are hopeful for a turnaround loan payments by consumers continued to outpace originations with loans declining billion in consumer banking led by mortgages plus we saw a normal seasonality in our card products as customers paid down holiday balances with stimulus contributing to the high payment rates but what is also noteworthy is the linked quarter improvement in gwim and global markets gwim continued to benefit from securitybased lending as well as custom lending in global markets we relaxed some hold limits as the economy continued to strengthen with respect to deposits on slide we continued to see tremendous growth across the client base not only because of growth in the money supply but also because we are adding new accounts and attracting liquidity from existing customers turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in q1 was billion billion on an fte basis net interest income declined billion from q1 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances but was relatively flat to q4 compared to q4 we see this as a good outcome considering the headwinds of two fewer days of interest lower loan levels and modestly higher premium amortization expense these headwinds were mostly offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities and a benefit of approximately million from a legacy litigation settlement involving some securities the net interest yield was relatively stable declining basis points from q4 and it was flat if you exclude global markets reducing cash and repo we deployed some of our excess liquidity into securities in q1 split across treasuries and mortgagebacked securities securities increased billion from yearend on a weighted average basis relative to what we were earning on the cash we improved our yield on that roughly billion by approximately bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 basis points now the improvement in yield could have been higher however but similar to q4 purchases we hedged a portion of the treasuries purchased with swaps effectively keeping those securities floating as you will note given all the deposit growth and low rates our asset sensitivity is rising our asset sensitivity to rising rates remained significant highlighting the value of our deposit and customer relationships sensitivity is lower from the yearend levels as higher rates and deployment of liquidity into securities increased our baseline so the sensitivity no longer assumes that liquidity is available to invest at higher rates a few thoughts on nii for the remainder of the year but first please note that these forwardlooking comments on nii assume that the forward interest rate curve materializes that the economy continues to recover and that we have some fairly modest loan growth in the back half of the year given those assumptions we expect some improvement in premium amortization across the next few quarters if mortgage rates follow the forward curve at billion in q1 writeoff for premium continued to be a headwind as mortgage prepayments remained quite high so forwardlooking comments include a lot of material moving parts from rates loan levels and premium amortization but as brian said we believe nii could rise by as much as billion from this quarters level okay turning to slide and expenses q1 expenses were billion billion higher than q4 i will add to some of the remarks brian mentioned earlier first q1 included the normal seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense of about million second as a result of the current periods solid revenue performance and a better outlook for revenue for the remainder of the year we accrued for higher incentives and experienced increased processing costs this added roughly million to the quarter third we incurred some expense that differs from our typical operating expense we reversed a decision made on some incentive comp awards making certain portions of those awards retirement eligible this accelerated approximately million of expense into q1 that would have been expensed over four years we also recorded an impairment charge of million for real estate realization and we incurred million of severance charge as we move back towards business as usual with respect to our head count this is based on an expectation that as roles get eliminated through process improvement some associates might choose severance over opportunities to work in a different role in the company lastly our covid costs remained largely unchanged as modest declines in some employeerelated costs were offset by costs associated with restarting ppp originations and forgiveness and additional unemployment claim processing covid costs are proving a little slower a little slower to safely reduce than we had hoped turning to asset quality on slide government stimulus and support has helped customers get through this pandemic that support coupled with our customer assistance programs and years of underwriting discipline under responsible growth has resulted in low net chargeoffs net chargeoffs this quarter were million or basis points of average loans and were lower than q4 and they were lower than the fourth quarter of which was the last quarter before the pandemic despite an expected increase in card losses of million in q1 with the exception of a small uptick in small business and the card losses losses in every other category declined from q4 provision was a billion benefit in the quarter as an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan balances resulted in a billion release of credit reserves total consumer reserve releases were billion driven primarily by card while the commercial release was billion our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at which still remained well above the where weve begun following our day one adoption of cecl bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 with respect to reserve setting assumptions we continue to include a multitude of scenarios based upon our q1 weighting of those scenarios gdp is forecasted to return to its level by the end of the weighted scenario also assumes that the unemployment rate at the end of will be just north of which is in line with march unemployment rate for the weighted average scenario assumed unemployment just under as we exit the year to the extent the economic outlook and the remaining uncertainties continue to improve we expect our reserve levels will move lower on slide we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios overall consumer net chargeoffs rose million from q4 and absent the million increase noted in card other losses declined with respect to card losses given the reduction in latestage delinquencies in the 180day pipeline we expect card losses to be lower in q2 npls remained low despite a small uptick due to consumer real estate deferrals which have limited expected loss content given healthy ltv ratios moving to commercial net chargeoffs declined million from the fourth quarter as the portfolio stabilized with reservable criticized exposure and npls declining in the quarter overall given the environment the asset quality of our commercial book remained solid and of the exposures are either investment grade or collateralized turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide consumer banking produced another strong quarter in terms of customer deposits and investment flows reflecting the strength of our brand the innovation around digital and deployment of specialists in our centers all of which has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity the segment earned billion in q1 versus billion in q4 as the provision benefit more than offset lower mostly seasonal revenue and higher expense revenue declined reflecting lower card income from q4s elevated holiday spending expenses moved higher as a result of real estate impairment costs as well as seasonally higher payroll tax expense this also caused an increase in our cost of deposits this quarter to basis points absent the impairment charge the cost of deposits would have been basis points as expected net chargeoffs rose in q4 due to the flow through of the bulge in card delinquencies as noted earlier a billion reserve release resulted in a million provision benefit in the quarter on slide you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments average deposits of billion are up compared to q1 with nearly twothirds of that growth in checking rate paid is down to basis points as of the deposits are low interest checking lastly note the growth throughout the quarter as average deposits were up billion from q4 we covered loans earlier so i would just note investment balances of billion are up yearoveryear as customers continued to recognize the value of our online offering as brian noted and as you can see on slide we continued to see improvement in digital enrollment this quarter of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform this year we continued to see digital payments in zelle taking hold across all our businesses zelle consumer dollar volume is up year overyear small business is up yearoveryear and of our businesstoconsumer payments in global banking are now made via zelle as you can see our digital assistant erica continues to add users capabilities and usage plus we are applying our success with erica to other businesses as well okay turning to wealth management we continued to deliver solid organic growth serve the comprehensive banking and investment needs of clients and manage risk responsibly we experienced strong new household bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 acquisition in a virtual environment and a very competitive market this resulted in a record quarter with respect to total client flows including near record aum flows and record aum fees net income of million improved from q4 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded an increase in expense with respect to revenue the record aum fees were complemented by higher nii on the back of solid loan and deposit increases expenses increased driven by revenuerelated costs and seasonally elevated payroll tax merrill lynch and the private bank both continued to grow clients as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients client balances rose to a record trillion up billion yearoveryear driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows during q1 our advisors added over net new households in merrill lynch and nearly net new relationships in the private bank lets skip to slide which is a new page that highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients in merrill and the private bank our clients and advisors have both embraced the value of a digitally enabled relationship in which digital tools are critical mechanisms for fast safe and secure interactions our wealth clients are some of the most highly engaged clients in the franchise with of merrill households digitally active in q1 we saw a record number of logins clients are logging in to trade check balances and originate loans with ease all of which can be done through a simplified signin we continue to enhance and modernize the capabilities for both the client and advisor and these capabilities are becoming key differentiators as well as being recognized by thirdparties moving to global banking on slide the business earned nearly billion in q1 improving million from q4 driven by a provision benefit and solid revenue while loan growth has been challenging deposit growth has been strong and investment banking revenue exceeded previous records the team produced billion in firm wide investment banking fees growing yearoveryear by and over q4 looking at revenue and comparing to q4 despite the higher ib fees total revenue declined driven by weatherrelated impairments on some tax advantaged investments provision expense reflected a reserve release of billion in q1 and quarterly net chargeoffs of million fell by million from q4 noninterest expense rose from q4 reflecting the incentive award changes noted earlier additionally the strong ib performance and improved outlook and seasonally elevated payroll tax increased personnel costs in q1 looking at the balance sheet on slide average deposits moved up relative to q4 as customers remained highly liquid yearoveryear deposits are up an impressive while rate paid is at an historic low as noted earlier loans declined early in the quarter but stabilized late in the quarter wholesale digital engagement continued to accelerate and usage continued to grow driven by the same ease safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities that our consumer customers enjoy we present some wholesale digital highlights on slide switching to global markets on slide results reflected the highest revenue quarter in over a decade with solid yearoveryear improvement and an even more significant increase relative to q4 as i usually do i will talk about the segments results excluding dva this quarter net dva was negligible but the yearago quarter had a million gain global markets produced billion of earnings in q1 more than double the level of q4 and up from q1 focusing on yearoveryear revenue was up on higher sales and trading and equity underwriting fees the yearoveryear expense increase was driven by volumerelated expenses in both card and trading and an acceleration in expense from changes in the incentive awards bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 sales and trading contributed billion to revenue increasing yearoveryear driven by a improvement in ficc and a increase in equities ficc results reflected gains in commodities and strong results in credit mortgage and municipal products versus relative weakness in the yearago period this was partially offset by reduced activity and trading opportunities in other macro products the strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in cash the business produced strong return delivering a return on capital in q1 finally on slide we show all other which reported profits of million compared to q1 the improvement in net income was driven by a larger tax benefit given an expected increase in esg activities this year the yearago quarter also included a modest reserve build our effective tax rate this quarter was and excluding the tax credit driven by our portfolio of esg investments our tax rate would have been for the full year absent any changes in the current tax laws or other unusual items we expect an effective tax rate to be in the range of to okay with that lets go to qa question and answer section operator operator instructions today well go first to glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much i wonder if we could just you gave us a lot of detail on the expense side i just wanted to try to get a jumping off point on the second quarter i think with all your comments it gets you to the low to mid billion range want to see if thats right and then if you could give us the right perspective meaning if you look you all were able to keep total expenses flat for many years while you grew the franchise now the economy is growing capital markets are very strong and the expense dollars have crept up but i dont believe bofa has an expense creep problem but i wonder if you could address that and give us the right perspective to look at thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure so in terms of the second quarter i think youre about right we expect expenses just north of billion depending on the revenue environment and the amount of progress we make in taking down the covid costs in terms of your comment about our ability to manage expenses we agree with you i think as brian noted in his opening comments weve managed not to increase expenses for years now and weve absorbed merit increases investments minimum wage improvement in benefits all the dramatic increase in processing volumes digital increases so where we have sort of as talked about on other calls we have been using operational excellence and other initiatives to basically fund the investments in our future i think our goal here is to clearly create operating leverage over an extended period of time weve talked about maybe expenses rising maybe at a level per year and i think thats probably the best guidance we could give you absent again some of the ins and outs we had a lot of variability this quarter and obviously were sitting here in the middle of a pandemic with a lot of covid expenses that have been a little bit more sticky than we had bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 all hoped but theyre going to come out theres no question about that and so well get back to kind of a normal level of expenses and a very reasonable growth level over the long term relative to revenue glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thank you thats exactly what i was looking for maybe just one other one weve seen a lot of growth in the private credit markets and it started out strong in middle market lending its transitioning and doing some now large corporate lending theres specialized lending in aircraft and transportation now so im curious given the breadth of your franchise all those things i mentioned are kind of in your backyard thats just a lending relationship they dont have the same franchise you have but curious if you see the growth in private credit as a significant competitor in your traditional backyard brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp id say glenn depending on the type of loan people have been in these markets for years think mortgage think other types of consumer credit and then the commercial side so sure that has an impact but our job is to compete through it but the reality whats having an impact now frankly is the draw rates and lines of credit and stuff are low and companies that are operating well theres companies that still need to get through the pandemic impact just arent using the lines and thats bumping along the bottom and weve shown you those longterm charts so we feel good about our middle market and our business banking businesses small businesses we feel good about theyre getting set up as the economy continues to improve and the growth will come back and the services and rate we can provide are competitive and so i dont think thatll ever change and i think it reaches further sometimes it reaches a step we wont do as a company obviously in terms of leverage extra amounts of leverage and things like that but we feel were very strong and competitive and before the pandemic hit we in middle market were growing midsingle digits and wed expect to return back to that level glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thats great thanks brian operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning brian brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good can you guys share with us i think you touched on the capital cushion being about billion and you announced a billion share repurchase program today obviously with the new stress capital buffer construct bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 that goes into effect in the third quarter you and your peers will be free to buy back your stock in the fashion in which you see it fits best for you guys can you give us some color on how youre thinking about that billion buyback on how it will proceed after you get the okay im assuming youre going to pass ccar of course in june that gives you the green light to do the buyback brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah well so lets start with a couple of things one is the number goes up this quarter because the average of the four quarters is you move forward a quarter and thats the higher average so well be able to do more this quarter and then assuming the new rules come into effect in july we have substantial cushion and well look to bring that cushion down were not going to were going to maintain a cushion over the ph borrower requirements well maintain a cushion over that youd expect us to move fairly apace to start to bring us closer to the cushion that was honestly held up by the suspension last year this time of our ability to repurchase stock at all for the first for the second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter of last year which if you go back and think about our original ccar filings we were going to buy back a substantial amount so well get back in the saddle and drive it forward and also because the earnings power of the company work on continue to work the dividend and so expect us to get right after as soon as we can gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and paul you talked about the loan loss reserve levels and when you compare them to your day one cecl number from january of obviously youre considerably higher than that number can you share with us the outlook for potential loan loss reserve releases and could you see an environment where you could approach that day one reserve level considering the economy when you look at your own forecast that you gave us today is much stronger than what it was on the day one in january can you give us some further color on that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure just on reserves absent a deterioration in environment which we dont expect we believe the reserves will continue to come down in the coming quarters as we remain as the remaining uncertainties continue to diminish in terms of the reserve versus sort of day one cecl every quarter we are reserving based upon the size and mix of our portfolio at that moment and our view of the future based upon independent sources so as you think about that youve got to recognize that our portfolio has changed for example card which as you know has some of the highest reserve rates is down from day one so you really need to think about how the mix has changed you just cant go back to our reserve level on day one which i think was basis points if im not mistaken and just apply that to todays numbers i think youve got to do a little bit of a product mix there to get back weve done that work and it shows we have still a significant ill call it cushion to day one gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator our next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i have two opposing views and hoping you can help me reconcile them as it relates to efficiency on the one hand its like your slides are very positive global bank digital connections wealth of households consumer digital still growing and the unit cost per dollar of deposit what basis points its like bestinclass so all that technology progress is noted on the other hand i look at slide and i see the efficiency ratio and i see the expenses and i hear the higher guidance for expenses for this year so i guess if you could help me reconcile these positive underlying trends with this number on the page of efficiency ratio and i do recognize that youre calling out a lot of expenses the billion increase quarteroverquarter should we consider that kind of just onetime and where should this efficiency ratio go over time thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so mike you pointed out the operating posture of the businesses continues to improve but as you go across page youve got to remember and you well know this that in the stuff on the left hand side of the page you had a rate environment that finally after years had come up to some level of fed funds rate and libor rates and stuff and that helped our efficiency ratio move under but even if you look at this quarter its and you back out the type of expenses that you drop in the low and then nii improvement will because that frankly as you well know comes with very little expense attached to it and ie that we dont need more branches and more infrastructure or even more commercial bankers as the loan usage goes up and the spread off of our floors due to our massive deposit base so i think you should expect it even on a pro forma basis you could see the low and you expect it to move back in the levels you see here as we move through the year pick up the nii and then if rates start to move up youd even pick up more mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and you dont always disclose how much you are investing but how is your investing spend i mean did you lighten up during the pandemic are you taking that now brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp not on the technology side mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc overall indiscernible basis brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp mike on the technology side we did well i mean technology initiatives last year were 3andchange and this year will go up frankly a bit in those numbers we gave you because we continue to take advantage of that and so i think branches opened up in new cities this quarter and were seeing the success from that markets that we werent in two three four five years ago were now moving in the top all organic and driving off of that and then salespeople now thats what weve probably lightened up last year just because the opportunities werent there but youre going to see us continue to reposition people from the efficiencies in the opex program bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 to the front and so head count rose really to support the exigencies of the circumstances when you couldnt have your teammates indiscernible each other you had to have a few more of them move and the issues that were there for social distancing and working from home and overstaffing because of highrisk employees so we ran up a little higher and now youre starting to see us drift down so that core number of head count would drive our expenses but the reality is we invested at the same rate last year in everything except for incremental commercial bankers probably than we did in past years and were going to do it again this year because the payback is huge mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last followup just on the covidrelated expenses seems like a little bit of a longer tail than maybe you had expected when do you think some of those come off i mean youve treated your employees well with the special payments and all the other efforts that youve made is that like another quarter or two are we toward the end of that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well were blending it its blending down because the situation change obviously as schools reopen and things like that we can normalize the we started last year this time and said teammates when you work from home well give you a day to hire somebody to come into your home take care of your kids so you can do a great job for our clients thats why our client scores continued to rise during the pandemic obviously as schools have reopened weve tailored that program and will normalize it at the end of the second quarter thats one thing obviously ppp mike it got extended again but as were seeing the volumes be more modest this time it could start to shape those teammates out the forgiveness program will take us longer just because its a tail obviously but were through done and so youll see that happen and the extra cleaning and meals for the teammates and the testing and all the things weve done that all will come down as we sort of normalize operations over the next six months but it took longer because things like ppp came out two more times since two or three times i guess running four would be the right number but so its good but were doing what we need to do to support our customers half a billion or half a million excuse me loans originated under four different programs so the constantly changing rules at the peak we had people working on it now weve got about there and in forgiveness and we can work it back down so think over the next six months youll see it start to blend down piece after piece after piece mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thanks sorry on the expenses again just on the covid expenses that you were discussing brian with paul remind us whats the kind of size ballpark of that im trying to think about the billion total expenses and if we took off the million kind of special stuff you announced this quarter and then the covid costs which bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 might be billion a year like is the might you rebase at some point at billion before business growth and things like that im just trying to kind of put some numbers on it is that reasonable paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i would think of covid expenses in the first quarter to be approximately million of net covid expenses that was roughly flat by the way to last quarter as brian said we ramped up for the new ppp and unemployment processes claims but we did offset some of that rampup with lower expenses associated with childcare and supplemental pay and things like that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so john just to be simpleminded about it the reason why we had we told you the full year is going to be higher is because we think its billion billion higher in the first quarter here that wasnt sort of in our mind because of timing differences on some of the compensation matters and other things so as you well know well get it were pushing it back down as fast as possible john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah yeah okay and then paul just wanted to follow up when youre talking about the interest rate disclosures you mentioned that the model doesnt assume deployment automatic deployment of liquidity anymore could you just explain that like what changed because of rate moves or deployment thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp the model doesnt assume automatic deployment of liquidity i think were talking about the up and down in the disclosures john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah yeah exactly yeah thats indiscernible paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean we got a little bit less asset sensitive because we deployed some liquidity in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter and so now thats in the baseline and when rates shock up you obviously youre not deploying that liquidity at a higher rate any more so it kind of moved from the sensitivity into the baseline you see what im saying john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got you got you okay got it and the next thing was just the nii ramp that could happen to get you billion higher by the fourth quarter how do you see that distributed is that kind of evenly or is it kind of based on the second half loan growth coming back bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah look weve been fairly careful about our guidance theres a lot of moving pieces here youve got amortization of premium that can move around youve got loan growth which is hard to predict so we want to be careful about being too specific about how we get from here to there i think we feel very good about getting to there again the guidance that we gave you that nii in the fourth quarter could be billion higher than what it was in the first quarter thats based upon the forward curve materializing and some modest loan growth in the back half of the year weve got some flexibility because we do have liquidity can go faster or slower on in terms of investing wed like to put that in loan growth and not necessarily into securities but we will invest it over time weve got to see the amortization expense start to come down it hasnt come down yet even though mortgage rates have gone up and like i said weve got to see some loan growth and well pick up at least two days here so thats the best perspective i can give you john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay fair enough thank you operator and our next question comes from matthew oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i just wanted to follow up on the deployment of liquidity that youve done you did a lot this quarter last quarter if we look back since the end of most of your deposits have been deployed into securities and most of those securities i think are longer term mortgagebacked that arent hedged i know you said some of the treasuries were hedged but thats a small portion of what you added so i guess just conceptually like is this signaling that you think rates have kind of gone up kind of the big moves already happened for the next few years are you kind of thinking loan growth is not going to come back that much or whats the thought of locking in so many assets at these rates this quarter and the last couple quarters paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well let me back up because i want to make sure that everybody is clear about kind of what we have done you went all the back to if you go all the way back to yearend deposits were up billion and loans were down billion so we created billion of liquidity to deploy somewhere plus were going to see some more deposit growth so the billion of liquidity had to be deployed somewhere through the end of q1 securities are up billion and cash and equivalents are up billion to billion but as i said in the remarks we bought treasuries but on about billion of those treasuries we have interest rate swaps so you can really think of the billion of cash as being billion in terms of our ability to fund loan growth or invest for term or other uses so weve been balancing liquidity capital and earnings throughout this whole process we dont tend to make bets on interest rates one way or another we just want to make sure that we can deliver for our customers no matter what happens and i think weve been trying to do that as weve gone through this pandemic again its all about balancing liquidity capital and earnings bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned about increasing hold limits a little bit i think youre referring to the trading businesses but if you could just circle back on that concept and give a little more detail on kind of where you were and where you are now in terms of the hold limits paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure i mean look we in terms of if you think about prepandemic underwriting criteria we are on the consumer side i think back to prepandemic now in terms of the commercial side there are still the affected industries that were watching carefully but everywhere else i think were back to prepandemic and in light of the size of our company in light of the need for loan growth i think were relaxed a little bit on some hold levels particularly in global markets where they have more of a moving and storage mentality around loans and what they do for customers so yeah were just taking a few maybe bigger positions than we might have otherwise taken prepandemic but its no real change in the underwriting standards the company is bigger we have more liquidity we have more capital so we think all of this is appropriate matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and thats with respect to large corporate loans not the trading book just to clarify paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp thats right thats right brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thats right matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes okay brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp but just across loan growth just to think about it whats going to drive the companys pl also on the consumer side especially if you look at it by business so the wealth management business actually has grown a little bit you got the commercial business down and consumer is down consumer is largely down because of mortgage churn but the big thing that happened is cards came down and whats been interesting to watch now and so because we pulled back this time last years unemployment went to everybody pulled back their underwriting criteria on that weve now reinstated as paul said so whats happened we did million units of new cards a quarter going into the last years first quarter it fell as low as ph its back up to 600andchange already and moving north on that and if you look by month its stacking back up and if you look at where thats coming from obviously the branch system which basically was run at around of the branches for the last six eight months nine months is only bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 catching back up as it opens up and sales come in so that bodes well obviously on the consumer side on the cards which are most important mortgages production will continue to get back up and prepayments slow down in a slightly higher rate environment youll see that bodes well there gwim has some of the mortgage aspects but on the type of lending that gwim does to affluent wealthy people theyve done a good job and theyve actually seen that grow and then you go to the business banking middle market and thats all line usage and so that should come through in order for the economy to expand this year is what our bank of america team has of that at some point companies have to access capital to meet that final demand and you should see that usage come up so even in things like the car business because there just arent the cars to sell youre seeing line usages down at lower levels so as you think across things that hold levels and things that paul is talking about enable us to push a little harder just because of the sheer size of our company but if you think about the flywheel that we have in the company as a production engine having had necessarily to be slowed down in the crisis with unemployment peaks and the final demand being crushed in the second quarter of the last year then turning that crank back up and just watch that flywheel start to take off thats what we have good confidence in in terms of getting right back on the loan growth but if you add it all together and we grew it would be billion of loans so to pauls point you still have tremendous excess capacity because the deposit growth is so strong on core transactional deposits with the commercial and consumer matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood thats helpful thank you operator our next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc question brian on just capital capital allocation and you were one of the only gcibs to really kind of trim down so that your gcib number didnt go up recently and im wondering if youre thinking about the opportunities there to lean into a higher gcib maybe do more in capital markets i know traditionally youve been looking to keep your rwas in markets very tight and im wondering if theres any thought to maybe leaning in at this stage given all the excess capital and liquidity that you have is that potentially an option thats on the table in addition to the buybacks that you discussed earlier brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 yeah so betsy and the two are not mutually exclusive at all except way at the margin way away from where we are now but with stock price increases and all the things that go into that calculation as you well know and theyre not all related to straight risk in terms of sheer size and just things that go in it is harder to maintain where we were at the end of last year and you might expect that we may move up a bucket and take advantage of that by actually expanding the business in the markets business with the opportunities there based on the capabilities that jimmy and the team and tom and the team have put together so why would you do that the reason why we do that is our clients have been growing and weve kept about a third of the size and even if you took away some of the growth just due to the deposit things it has come down around the size of the company and the idea is to keep it in synergy and synchronize it with the companys overall size but the company has grown around it another step and so we told tom tom and the team are working on ideas to continue to do that were a little bigger now than we were at yearend obviously first quarter activity but you shouldnt expect us to come down now those ratios arent effective for a bit of time here so well see how it plays out but if the opportunities are there well take them the team has done a great job and managed the risk well look at the trading results for the quarter look at it for last quarter look at it throughout the pandemic theyve done a great job in managing risk and were balancing and were proud of them on the work theyve done and were going to support them with some more capital betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats great thanks and then separately one of the most tedious discussions that i have with people is on comping your skill set in digital consumer apps and everything youre doing there not only for consumer but also for corporate and smbs with fintech players and i say its tedious because you have huge market presence okay but i dont feel like youre getting your message out there beyond this call so have you given any thought to trying to get the message of what youve done for consumers in the digital and the fintech that you actually are bringing to your clients beyond the four walls of your clients brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well lets always start with the first thing the reason why we do this is to serve our clients and do a great job and it flows through the numbers as mike said earlier the idea that we run this huge consumer business at a cost advantage which is significant due to the digitalization of all the consumer activity due to the way customers interact with us the way we can help them the way we can give guideposts and frankly the way we can take the fee structure out and thats weve dropped overdraft fees dramatically over the years and made up for it in terms of efficiency and other types of things and so we get the word out we tell everybody were winning all kinds of awards and the lists go on and on in terms of the different ranking agencies and youve seen it in the merrill edge growth thats over billion now and so our job is to do a great job for our customers and i think ill leave it to you and your colleagues to debate the relative merits of a fintech versus ours but i will tell you for a company making billion and having million new digital customers that are fully active on the consumer side million on the digital on the corporate side the impact on our ability to have expenses be flat from even with extra money of billion or so in the first quarter from six years ago shows the impact of the ability to digitize this company and we learned more about this in the last year in areas that we didnt do it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 so well keep pushing it out there you can help us tell the story but the reality is that the number one person we want to understand is our customers and that means attrition attrition of the customers is way down the penetration of the wallets way up just look on the wealth management statistics we threw in and see how that theyve adapted to it these are major changes the size of which dont exist much out there so well keep pounding away you keep telling the story well keep telling the story but the key is its producing its producing the kind of earnings were producing and the kind of efficiencies were producing which continues to be down to our benefit going forward the neatest thing about this stuff is where we go next with it where weve been going with it so erica theres just nothing close to it out there and driving with volumes and things zelle if you look at the charts and the pages and show it so its the usage and the personalization and the ability to help people manage their payments and their things for the mass market and their investments so we feel good about it well tell the story as often as we can but the reality is that wed like to see us keep growing the number of customers and driving it and driving it on an integrated basis were putting major investments in a couple areas we had to improve merchant services payments on the commercial side at the merchant level and were putting major investments in the 401k technology to push that were number seven in that business its the lowest market position of any business we have number six or seven whatever we are so these are major investments were making hundreds of millions of dollars a year that go into that expense base that are paid for by the efficiency of the core businesses betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator and our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to ask a followup on the nii outlook and really specific to premium amortization just given the sheer amount of growth weve seen in the mbs portfolio the deployment of all the excess liquidity paul i was hoping you could help size what the premium and benefit would be if we did see prepayment speed revert to more normal levels and how much of that benefit is contemplated in the billion increase in the exit rate for paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure so let me just give you a couple of perspectives one the premium amortization in the first quarter was about billion and as you point out the securities portfolio has grown so as you try to size what it could come down to you just cant go back to last year and look at what it was because the portfolio has gotten a lot bigger thats sort of one two as i think about that billion i would say the most important driver would be the modest loan growth and the second most important driver would be the reduction in premium amortization so maybe thats enough guidance right there again were not going to go down to where it was in q1 really think because weve grown so much but its going to be meaningful in terms more than a few hundred million dollars in terms of that guidance we gave you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay understood and for my followup just wanted to ask on capital if i look at your slr ratio excluding the relief and your cet1 ratios if i assume maybe like a target on cet1 on slr the cet1 is still your binding constraint today but just looking at the sheer amount of balance sheet growth you guys saw this past quarter i think it was about billion or so our analysis suggests that you maybe have another billion to billion of balance sheet growth headroom before the slr becomes binding and as we consider expectations just for additional qe fed balance sheet growth how are you preparing for that potential what sort of mitigating actions might you take if the slr does in fact become binding brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp its just way out there steven i dont think your numbers are right indiscernible take you through some calculations but i think the number is a lot bigger than you think paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah weve done that work and weve come up with a bigger number in terms of balance sheet capacity brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah on the slr its basis points times a much bigger base or basis points in your example to maintain so its multiples of that its bigger than what weve grown so far indiscernible steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah i guess i can i think what the difference is there is the lens of like what constraint becomes more binding and its the slr i recognize you have excess under both but if the ratio is going to shake out sub6 pro forma that relief i guess at a ratio thats billion of capacity to grow but in terms of like where you have the most excess it looks like slr becomes binding in relatively short order which is maybe a couple more quarters of billion plus growth in the balance sheet so i guess thats what i was trying to get at is would you look to mitigate it given it becomes a little bit more binding than your cet1 constraints brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp weve managed all the capital ratios to maintain the minimum requirement thats not the issue but i think its hundreds of billions of dollars away so paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah were at pro forma right so april and thats billionish of capacity down to the regulatory minimum as you said wed want to have a buffer but thats the rough math steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 okay fair enough i can take it offline with lee later on anyway but thats very helpful in how you framed it so thanks very much for taking the question operator and the next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global securities please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe first on just maybe the cadence for card chargeoffs obviously we had a little bit of an increase this quarter but 30plus day delinquencies are now back down to almost near lows should we expect i think we hit chargeoffs that were in the in the fourth quarter are we heading back towards that or how do we think you have lower balances how do we think about the trajectory of card chargeoffs given your view of the delinquencies brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp if you go to page jim you can see it you kind of summarized it but we went from up to so itll turn back down just because look at the charts you can see that what produces next quarters chargeoffs is obviously on the right hand side of this page and its coming down and so you have balances lower but also you just have sheer delinquency and as you think further out its going to come from the left hand side of the page and migrate to the right from actual chargeoffs leave aside the projected and provisioning under the cecl but just so youve got it right it comes down and you would hope frankly that if we get the growth it might change this dynamic in six months or something like that just because it takes a while to get any delinquency out of anything maybe even much longer than that but this bodes well for the next couple of quarters james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right so i mean the reason i ask is that if you look at chargeoff ratios late last year they were lower than pre covid levels so you still think we can sort of keep that very low level at least for now until balances maybe start to grow more significantly is that the takeaway brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well theyll probably yeah theyll go down as balances grow because there will be no delinquency then a year later when the delinquency from those balances whatever minor amount it is comes through it might add to it and so the denominator effect will push even down further on percentages as the balances go up near term james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay and maybe my followup on the technology side you guys did an acquisition a small one obviously of axia in your merchant processing business can you just sort of give your thoughts on the opportunity set as you build out that platform are there more acquisitions do you think involved whats your excitement level i guess of building that platform out brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 look its a great little company that we can put across the platform has a wonderful market position where it plays and were very proud of the deal but the key is that we youve got to go back to the whole history of merchant services we sold half of it in a joint venture years ago now or whatever it was raised some capital come forward we bought it back remember thats one of the reasons why the expense run rate moved up by million million a year that people forget about is because we brought that in last year for half a year and it wasnt in two years ago but the reason why we brought it back is really to invest around the platform so whats exciting about it is things like the acquisition to take us in the medical area whats exciting about it is the ability to actually sell it through this sales force without having to have a nonowned sales force selling it in our small business and our business banking colleagues that thousands of people out there can help deliver the product and then whats really exciting is the integration of payment scheme that weve been working on for commercial payments so its the integration of the p2p zelle to small business and all these payment gateways which is outside the traditional merchant business but you have to be completely flexible along all payment schemes to actually root it much more favorable to the merchant with very low cost to them and realtime contemporaneous value exchange so what were doing with realtime payments and zelle in combination into the business platforms through the payment gateways these are all exciting things then you go larger end its the different elements and blockchain payments and everything else so thats the core of the business on the commercial side but it goes all the way from small business all the way up to large companies and so that investment was part of that the new investments part of that and youll expect us to keep driving at the implementation the good news is were getting the network effect of zelle and things like that when you look at those pages that zelles half the credit card charge volume used by our consumers to make payments now so you noodle on that for a minute think million credit card people out there charging the zelle is reaching half if it checks down over the last couple of years in terms of checks written volume by our consumers so you get the network effect of that and then you get the merchants to use it with real time so this was all part of a thing that thong nguyen and mark monaco and the team are leading indiscernible on the commercial side that you should expect to see a lot a lot of investment has been made including a major replacement of system thats coming through the pl this year and the change in bringing the people fully on balance sheet and a lot of investment will be made including acquisitions like we just made james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats great color thanks brian operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks just one question on just card and stimulus and how do you guys get the sense of how much of the stimulus and incremental deposit growth is sticking around versus now kind of starting to be spent and whats the tradeoff with regards to the staging around that releveraging or that balance growth that might start to come over time in the card business specifically thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 yeah i think just on it depends literally when you look in customers earnings power and things like that but largely i think paul last i saw was 30odd percent of the stimulus money has been spent to make it to be simpleminded about it and so the other is sitting in peoples accounts its a little bit different by stratification of earnings power of the household and so thats to be spent that bodes well for economic reopening and stuff and has that had an effect on balances on card and stuff yes because consumers have used it to pay down their debt and part of what has been spent has been spent to pay down card balances and then with limited travel youre just not getting as much use but the good news is youve watched january to february to march with the virus and vaccine pathways come into the fore youre starting to see the purchase numbers go up and the payments rate went way up as you observed last year through last year in this quarter but youd expect that that might be more constant than the usage rate would go up and start to drive some balance growth which is good news so the good news is that consumers are healthy from every aspect we have no deferrals left except in the mortgage business so all the debate we had about those last year this time through the system delinquencies down consumers sitting with money in their accounts and the economy opened up which bodes well and thats what you saw on the retail sales numbers today and you expect those numbers to even be higher in the month of april because march was a partly reopened month and the weather wasnt too pleasant in the northeast if you want to eat outside in the northern parts of the central country ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and thats the offset the offset is in jims question about that better credit could stick as an offset as well if theres still sitting around so well take that tradeoff brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and remember where we play yeah where we lend money in the consumer space we never came close to what the projected losses were we decided that the model was projected that you knew by watching the consumer delinquency and unemployment levels of our consumers they are much lower than society and as that became clearer thats what youre seeing coming through the reserve releases right now ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right thanks brian brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 operator it would appear we have no further questions ill return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks brian t
