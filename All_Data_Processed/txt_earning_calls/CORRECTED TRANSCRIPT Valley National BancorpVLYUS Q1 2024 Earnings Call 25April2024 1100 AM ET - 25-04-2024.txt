please go ahead travis lan senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp good morning and welcome to valleys first quarter earnings conference call presenting on behalf of valley today are ceo ira robbins president tom iadanza and chief financial officer mike hagedorn before we begin i would like to make everyone aware that our quarterly earnings release and supporting documents can be found on our company website at valleycom when discussing our results we refer to non gaap measures which exclude certain items from reported results please refer to todays earnings release for reconciliations of these nongaap measures additionally i would like to highlight slide of our earnings presentation and remind you that comments made during this call may contain forwardlooking statements relating to valley national bancorp and the banking industry valley encourages all participants to refer to our sec filings including those found on forms 8k 10q and 10k for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those statements with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis during the first quarter of valley reported net income of million and earnings per share of exclusive of noncore items adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were million and respectively the quarters results were impacted by an outsized provision for loan losses which i will discuss shortly on a pretax preprovision basis we saw a positive inflection this quarter the sequential downward trend in net interest income slowed meaningfully despite the lower day count during the quarter this reflects the benefit of asset pricing and our efforts to better control funding costs fee income results were strong supported by certain unique businesses including tax credit advisory finally noninterest expenses were extremely well controlled despite the seasonal headwind associated with higher payroll taxes despite the continuation of the inverted yield curve and other environmental challenges i am pleased with the stronger pretax preprovision earnings results this quarter im also pleased with the quarters balance sheet strength and credit quality performance on slide we outlined certain efforts made to curtail loan growth enhanced reserve coverage where needed in the portfolio and incrementally optimize our funding base total loans declined nearly million during the valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 quarter as a result of our proactive efforts to participate out a portion of certain commercial real estate and construction loans and the sale of our commercial premium finance business these sale transactions each occurred at or above par and incrementally benefit our commercial real estate concentration capital ratios and reserve levels our allowance for credit losses for loans as a percentage of total loans increased basis points to during the quarter meanwhile our past due and nonaccrual loans both declined as compared to december the higher provision and associated reserve coverage reflects internal risk rating migrations resulting from our continuous monitoring and rigor stress testing of the commercial loan portfolio during the quarter an additional of loans transitioned into either our criticized or classified loan buckets while we remain comfortable with the sponsorship collateral support and potential loss content of these loans criticized loans require elevated reserve coverage under cecl we are comfortable with the current reserve coverage levels but anticipate that the allowance could trend slightly higher over the next few quarters our focus on and expertise in commercial real estate lending has generated strong and stable riskadjusted financial results throughout our history the strength of our commercial real estate underwriting and the consistently industryleading loss content of our portfolio has contributed to significant shareholder value creation through above average tangible book value growth our strong network of borrowers have banked with valley for decades and have performed very well in other periods of rising interest rates we remain very confident with our capital allocation and in future credit performance of our commercial real estate portfolio that said i acknowledge that our perceived concentration in commercial real estate has recently amplified the volatility in our companys valuation this volatility is based purely on perception and is not reflective of our financial results nor the strength of our credit quality and balance sheet still we exist to serve our key stakeholders and while im proud of our ability to exceed the expectations of our clients communities and employees i acknowledge that the volatility experienced by our shareholders is not sustainable commercial real estate is a wonderful asset class and one in which our differentiated approach continues to create incredible value we will remain active in this space but well manage our concentration more efficiently going forward our diversifying ci initiatives will continue to accelerate and we will further enhance our financial flexibility these efforts are consistent with our established strategic plan and i believe that accelerating them will help to reduce the volatility in our valuation with this in mind you can see our near and intermediateterm expectations for certain balance sheet metrics on slide we expect to have approximately tier common equity commercial real estate or riskbased capital an allowance coverage ratio above and a loantodeposit ratio around by yearend these metrics are consistent with the strategy which we have discussed previously and our ongoing efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility the following slide updates our previously provided guidance the downward revision to our net interest income forecast reflects slower loan growth and a modest funding mix shift related to lower noninterest bearing deposit balances during the first quarter we anticipate that the downward revision in net interest income for the year will valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 be largely offset by lower noninterest expenses relative to our prior guidance all else equal this will lead pretax preprovision income relatively in line with current consensus expectations on slide we provide additional commentary on our base case net interest income scenario as well as some considerations related to our exposure to changing interest rates as we have described before our balance sheet is generally neutral to changes in shortterm interest rates we are more sensitive to movement in longer end rates which impacted repricing of roughly of our loans before turning the call to tom i wanted to highlight the underlying franchise value that we continue to create despite the volatility in our valuation since the end of we have grown reported tangible book value by versus just for our regional banking peers including the impact of distributed dividends this increases to versus just respectively this positive variance reflects our ability to enhance our franchise without meaningfully diluting tangible book value and overpriced acquisitions or through other efforts to maximize near term results customer account growth is another key metric that gauges our ability to build and optimize our franchise since yearend we have more than doubled our number of commercial deposit accounts which is in direct alignment with our strategic objectives the ongoing addition of new deposit clients is critical as it supports our future earnings potential and financial consistency this growth has been broadbased across geographies and business lines and we continue to work hard at sustaining this momentum we also believe there is significant value in the geographic diversity that we have developed on both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet at the end of nearly of our commercial loans were concentrated in new york and new jersey that figure has declined to nearly today as a result of our focus in florida and other dynamic commercial markets we continue to develop exceptional serviceoriented banking teams across the country which are focused on generating and enhancing the valuable commercial relationships that we have targeted this progress has benefited the funding side of our bank as well in of our deposits were in northeast branches as of the end of the first quarter that number has declined to we have diverse niche funding businesses and a robust branch network across florida and alabama this diversity helps to insulate our funding base and provides unique and differentiated opportunities to further reduce our reliance on wholesale funding over time on last quarters call i laid out three strategic imperatives for the coming year our early results indicate solid traction relative to enhancing our cost effective core deposit funding the deemphasis of commercial real estate and more revenue diversity as mentioned we will continue to accelerate the diversification of our loan portfolio and i have all the confidence well continue to produce solid results with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results after mike concludes his remarks tom mike myself and mark saeger our chief credit officer will be available for your questions thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide illustrates the quarters deposit trends total deposits declined slightly due to the intentional runoff of higher cost time deposits which had matured from a customer deposit perspective this runoff is primarily offset by growth in interestbearing nonmaturity deposits within our specialty deposit niches valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 our ability to tactically reduce deposit pricing in certain product types and categories helped to meaningfully slow the pace of deposit cost increases during the quarter despite a rotation of approximately million of non interest deposits into interestbearing deposits our total cost of deposits increased a modest basis points the next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business line traditional branch deposits declined slightly as a result of the runoff of certain higher cost time deposits that said we saw stable deposit trends in our southeast franchise our specialty niches increased slightly during the quarter as our online deposits and technology business continue to expand slide illustrates the management actions which reduced loans during the quarter total loans declined nearly million driven primarily by commercial real estate and construction participations out of the bank importantly these participations were executed with no negative impact to equity we continue to monitor opportunities to further participate out certain loans and to enable certain maturing loans to refinance away from valley the sequential reduction in ci loans was due entirely to the sale of our commercial premium finance business and subsequent maturities in that remaining portfolio we continue to focus our origination efforts on traditional ci owneroccupied real estate and healthcare on slide i would highlight that our loan to values are based on the most recent appraisal received on the property the average life of these appraisals is approximately years our debt service coverage ratios are calculated based on the most recent borrower financial formation that we have which is typically received at least annually the following two slides provide additional detail on our multifamily and office portfolios we continue to have modest exposure to new york multifamily loans and highlight that a near million or roughly of that sub portfolio has more than rent controlled units our office portfolio remains diverse by geography and supported by generally diverse cash flows with nearly of our loans to multitenant properties with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom staying on the cre topic for a moment slide illustrates the contractual maturities of our commercial real estate portfolio we also included the ltv dscr and rate by maturity bucket for your benefit this maturity schedule illustrates the minimal repricing risk of our loans maturing over the next few quarters slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends the modest sequential declines in both net interest income and net interest margin were primarily the result of one fewer day in the quarter we strategically lowered deposit costs by approximately basis points on nearly billion of deposits which helped to stabilize net interest income as the quarter progressed this helped to offset the headwind associated with lower average noninterest bearing deposits during the quarter after shortening our liability duration during the first quarter we locked in a small amount of longterm funding at relatively attractive costs which will further benefit net interest income during the second quarter all else equal turning to the next slide you can see that noninterest income on an adjusted basis improved meaningfully from the fourth quarter of a portion of this improvement was related to rebounding deposit service charges as some fees were waived around our conversion in the fourth quarter of valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 beyond this we offset headwinds in swap revenue on commercial loan transactions with improved wealth revenues and a very strong quarter from our tax credit advisory business on that front dudley ventures had certain tax credit transactions closed during the quarter which had been delayed from the end of while demand for our tax credit advisory services continues to grow we would anticipate that dudleys revenues will decline somewhat from this quarters elevated levels on the following slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter adjusting for our million fdic special assessment and certain other noncore charges noninterest expenses were approximately million on an adjusted basis this represents a decline from the adjusted fourth quarter of and a near increase on a yearoveryear basis the quarters increase in compensation costs was primarily the result of seasonal payroll tax impacts as head count remains generally well controlled we saw notable reductions in our technology and consulting expenses as the costs associated with our core conversion in the fourth quarter of continued to run off while revenue pressures have weighed on our efficiency ratio in recent quarters our expense base continues to be stable relative to our balance sheet and well below peer levels for the same comparison the key pillars on slide not only support our conservative underwriting and strong credit performance but also our ability to mitigate losses in periods of stress i will discuss this more in a moment slide offers a general comparison of our lending approach as a relationshipbased regional bank with more transactional oriented institutions we have deep market knowledge and bank wellknown and active investors who are strongly aligned with the need to protect and enhance their property values over time our borrowers tend to be more disciplined and value oriented with respect to project selection from an underwriting perspective we generally focus on inplace not projected cash flows which provides an added buffer should noi growth not materialize we hope these pages provide some further context for the credit results illustrated on slides and on you can see the continued stability in our nonaccrual and past due loan buckets the bottom charts illustrate our allowance for credit loss coverage relative to loans and past due loans as ira mentioned the quarters increase in allowance was primarily related to quantitative reserves associated with the migration of loans into criticized and classified categories we remain confident with the performance and potential loss content of these loans we are comfortable with the current position of the allowance but acknowledge that further real estate stress and elevated interest rates could move our allowance coverage somewhat beyond during the remainder of turning to slide net chargeoffs ticked up during the quarter as a result of a million chargeoff related to taxi medallion loans commercial real estate chargeoffs were de minimis we present two important analysis at the bottom of this slide on the bottom left we compare loss given default ratios on our commercial real estate and construction loans to peers over a variety of timeframes loss given default is a calculation of chargeoffs relative to nonaccrual loans this analysis suggests that over time our non accrual loans were significantly less likely to be charged off than our peers given our loss mitigation techniques the most important loss mitigation tool that we have in times of stress is typically the deep resources and liquidity of our wealthy borrower base valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 on the bottom right we illustrate our reserve relative to implied years of coverage based on certain loss rates while our allowance coverage is below peers on an absolute basis we believe that relative to potential loss content we remain consistently better reserved for example our current reserve would cover six years of implied loan losses based on the average net chargeoff rate between and this is double the relative reserve coverage of our peers we remain confident that we are wellpositioned for a potential deterioration of credit quality across the industry our below peer loss rates relative to total loans and cre loans specifically are illustrated on slide as we have said historically our loss rates tend to be roughly of peer levels through the cycle the next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios tangible book value increased slightly from the fourth quarter of despite a modest headwind from the oci impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio regulatory capital ratios have continued to expand and as ira mentioned earlier we anticipate further expansion for the rest of and beyond with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will conduct a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so ira first on the cre concentration moving down to lower could you give us a sense of your billion of cre loans in the quarter including construction where should we expect those to trend for the rest of the year and do you think you could continue to do what you did this quarter exit at par ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think when we look at that cre concentration its really a function of not including the owneroccupied loans into that so i think on one of our slides when we give the breakout of the balance sheet probably gives a bit better of what that starting number looks like i think we had a really successful quarter in working with indiscernible and some of the other partners that we work with over the years and looking at increased participations valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 as you can see on the loan yield maturities that we have coming due there really is not a significant variance versus where our current portfolio sits versus where market indications or rates are today so there really isnt a rate issue as our which would hinder some of our ability to really offset some of the loans that we have from a participation perspective and as youve seen over the years the credit quality has been really really stellar here and as people have gone through and looked at the loans they tend to agree with that assessment as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful im curious ira so the stocks off i think its a little over this year and you mentioned perception i believe in terms of on the real estate portfolio when you compare yourselves i mean this is what happened in the aftermath of new york community would you compare your preportfolio to peer banks what do you think the markets missing ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i mean i think to acknowledge that there is not an issue in commercial real estate on a macro perspective i think would be putting my head in the sand i think that said if you really dive into the areas that are really under stress today i think office is an obvious right and thats just not a function of where interest rates are thats behaviors have actually changed the rent regulated in new york city is another area of stress and then i think from a third perspective is its the repricing risk that exists so if you just really isolate those three specific areas and then dive into the underlying details of where valley is on those three specifics on the office portfolio its about billion but when you look at the specific underlying metrics of those loans theyre very small in size in addition to that what we tried to do is give you an update even on what those updated debt service coverage ratios are so were sitting at times of debt service coverage ratio on the office portfolio which i think is very differentiated i would say the larger differentiation on the office is actually the size our office is only million on average i mean there really is not much stress within those types of offices that were lending against so i think thats something thats probably a little bit differentiated and then on the rent regulated is obviously a little bit differentiated as well as tom mentioned in his prepared comments were only sitting with about million of rent regulated thats north of of what that composition looks like so once again i think its a very small portfolio and very manageable as we think about what the risk of that portfolio looks like everythings current today ph with things in that portfolio and then i think the third one that i alluded to was really the rate reset risk and we tried to give a little bit more granularity in the earnings call as well as in the presentation the rate reset risk is not what its like as many of our peers here that said look i acknowledge the cre concentration is pretty significant and on a macro level we look at the concentration and people just have a perspective of what that is at valley so im aware of that i acknowledge it i think as an organization we need to begin to reduce what that macro cre concentration is but at valley cre concentration doesnt mean that youre going to have an absolute loss we migrated some loans into classified and criticized loans this specific quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 as we mentioned before the loss history is very very different here at valley as well because the loan gets classified as a criticized loan here does not mean youre going to have a loss associated with that weve proven that yearoveryear i think in the third quarter we had a significant increase in what our classified loans were as well and if you look at the results this quarter theres not an uptick in nonaccrual theres not an uptick in delinquency yet we had an uptick in classified a few quarters ago so i think its just getting familiar with the granularity of what our portfolio is which takes time for some people and takes effort as well that said we have patients here and were very comfortable that over the long term were going to end up in a really good spot steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful if i could just ask one other one and change direction on the expense the updated expense guide just as below low end of the range what actions you guys think youve done a lot right over the past few years and what is the new range in terms of what youre thinking for expense growth this year ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think its hopefully lower than where it is today i think we announced on last call not last call excuse me last year right when we started to really see some additional pressure associated with the inverted yield curve that were going to put forth a head count reduction in june of last year when you look at the actual numbers we went from employees in june of were sitting at employees today so weve decreased by on the employee head count overall we think theres more opportunity to continue that overall focus and i think the bigger piece is steve that people underestimate the amount of resources from an internal and external perspective associated with the core conversion that we did at the end of a significant amount of expense was associated with that and we continue to really begin to recognize some of the benefits of being on one platform and we think that will continue throughout as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it ira thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from matthew breese from stephens inc please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc as we think about commercial real estate growth in light of the updated guidance and actions this quarter should we expect active runoff in that book and if so to what extent or should we expect that loan segment to essentially remain flattish while all the other segments ci especially grow around it thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah hey matt its tom as you see we revised our guidance for our total loans to be between and from the to annualized we are intentionally managing our real estate portfolio by focusing on our top relationshipdriven clients we originated about million in real estate loans in the first quarter which is down significantly from what we have done in the past few years we will still be active and involved in real estate but we will still continue to sell loans the loans that are not relationshipdriven well let them mature and leave in the first quarter there were about million of loans that matured and exited to other banks and ill point out all at full value to the bank were not changing our ci expectations weve grown that portfolio on an annual basis outside of the premium finance sale where we have been slightly up in the first quarter first quarter is traditionally a slow quarter we tend to get ph loan utilization paydowns our owneroccupied portfolio in the first quarter grew annualized so thats a positive event our pipelines and ci are very stable and we originated billion of ci loans in the first quarter which is in line with what we have done in the past matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then with cecl it feels like we were all ph taught to think about historical losses and forwardlooking economic factors and the reserve was supposed to be catered to each institution based on these assumptions but in the wake of newer community and now the category for bank classification it feels like theres a third leg to the stool which is your peer group and what theyre doing is it fair to assume with that in mind that longer term beyond what youve outlined for the intermediate term that a lot of your ratios commercial real estate reserve capital needs to migrate to your category for peer like levels despite whatever cecl says in terms of your quartertoquarter change in reserving mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp hey matthew this is mark saeger just as it relates to our model one of the positives is we use a transition matrix model which is very sensitive to migration in the portfolio we hold an elevated level of reserves against criticized and classified credits so we get an immediate bump through the migration in our reserve which shows the appropriateness of that migration not just loss and about twothirds of the increase in our reserve for the quarter was related to migration within the portfolio ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think on a macro basis though matt i mean with to your specific question do we have to be at where peer levels are right i think at our size organization were only billion its a long runway for us to get to valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 billion so to look at where those reserve ratios are and automatically imply that we need to be at those levels based on sort of this third perspective of what cecl looks like i think would be an incorrect assumption i think the accounts are pretty clear what drives the cecl model and as mark mentioned its going to uptick a little bit because of what were seeing with the transition and a bit of an increase in some of those classified loans and criticized loans but i dont think theres a guidance as we need to be at whatever the 100billionplus banks are matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i guess im more concerned about the cre concentration because that those peers operate at a median of concentration the highest is mt theyre around billion billion and were a long way off from that so by the time you get to billion you have to have made some significant changes along the way and im curious if thats part of the plan here ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think obviously going to billion and saying were going to have cre concentration is something that that doesnt make any sense that said obviously we have a very long runway matt i mean if you even took a growth rate on our balance sheet today its over six years before we even get to billion and theres a lot thats going to happen at valley over the next 6ish years and i think getting the cre concentration down is something we talked about for years now of what the strategic focus has really been here weve instituted ci business lines from the tech business to a commodities business to all different types of ci businesses many many years ago with a focus on beginning to diversify what that portfolio looks like as tom mentioned were growing ci annualized so its not like we woke up one day and said hey the cre concentration is too high we need to begin to establish some of these foundational ci businesses weve been doing it for years and weve actually seen a lot of positive outcomes associated with that ci business as well so obviously the cre cannot be the same level at valley that its been historically and we put a lot of good strategic initiatives in place to really begin to drive ci business here that weve seen the fruits of for many years now and we anticipate continuing to accelerate that matthew breese q analyst stephens inc last one for me and then ill hop back in the queue tom you had mentioned undergoing it sounds like fairly extensive stress test for your commercial real estate book and it shows that over time youve had better loss content versus peers curious what types of assumptions were overlaid in that in those stress tests and at the end of the day what was the kind of loss content what was the chargeoffs that stress has resulted in thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp so we dont publish needless to say our specific stress test assumptions but we do stress occupancy rent per square foot vacancies overall rate and market conditions as part of that stress testing and then test that against our overall capital to ensure that were remaining a wellcapitalized organization valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp matt and i think one thing i would just add to that is the size of the scope of what we do when it comes to the credit review process we laid out on slide really valleyspecific credit framework and thats really led to a lot of the lower loss given defaults that mike mentioned earlier we manually credit officers looked at over of the commercial real estate portfolio just this last quarter so stress testing for us isnt just what assumptions youre applying to those stress testing but the scale of what that stress testing is its not just hey lets look at a couple loans that are coming due in the next 12ish months its really deep dives on each of these individual portfolios so what youre seeing in the migration this quarter isnt just reflective of loans that are coming due in the next ish months its of the entire cre book that we have matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i appreciate all the color there thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co hi guys good morning just to follow up on the last line of question a little bit just on the i just want to make sure i understand on slide the reserve mike you talked about being relatively comfortable with where reserves are and given loss rates you have actually better reserved than peers in many ways but so just trying to understand when we get to the roughly ph reserve over the next to months so whats the driver there is it as the commercial real estate book matures and reprices or is that just kind of more as you grow getting in line with peers over time ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think from a macro perspective its probably two things right obviously the cre reviews that we do and the migration associated with that has really benefited us from what the loss given defaults are so potentially theres going to be a bit more migration to what that cre looks like as we go through the rest of the portfolio and i think one of the other drivers is really on the ci side as we continue to originate more ci loans theyre going to come at a higher reserve ratio than what the rest of the historical cre does so thats automatically going to end up driving up what that coverage ratio looks like frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay and then just wondering about the potential to accelerate some of this reduction in concentration you obviously moved some stuff out of cre at par this quarter and obviously it seems like theres been some valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 opportunity on the commercial side weve certainly seen commercial teams moving around id say given to a greater degree given some of the dislocation in the marketplace lets say so im just curious as you think about that if thats something that you guys are seeing potential there to maybe accelerate this to greater mix shift in the near term ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think maybe ill start if you dont mind and then ill turn it over to tom but i think one of the constraints that weve always operated in here is what that tangible book value number is right and its really been a focus within the organization to not dilute shareholders through tangible book value transactions as we mentioned earlier whether it be through silly ma transactions that have very long buybacks or through balance sheet restructures i mean we see that today and whats happening with some securities books we see whats happening with also sales so i think thats a constraint that we look at to make sure what our alternatives are that we have to make sure that that tangible book value and capital really continue to grow within the organization that said we were able to execute a lot at par today and thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp frank in your referencing question regarding depositdriven commercial teams we have opportunistically added teams in certain markets including the southeast and the north frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right i guess the big it just seems like theres a lot of movement i dont know if maybe some of these things end up being too expensive on the front end of things obviously you guys reduced your expense guide a bit yeah so i was just curious if maybe there was a significant pickup opportunity here just in the near term weve obviously seen some other press releases from other places and so i was just curious about anything in the near term of size ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah maybe then i misunderstood your question at first and i apologize i thought you were going a little bit more on the loan side and i should just defer to tom right after that look i think as we mentioned on the call were seeing a lot of growth in that southeast market so some of the dislocation that youre seeing up here in the northeast with people coming with teams they obviously come at a significant expense weve looked at some of them and the marginal cost to bring on some of those deposits when you combine it with the expense of those teams were finding much much cheaper alternatives elsewhere and thats where we intend to allocate a lot of our resources to frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay no that makes sense appreciate it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator great thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from ph emily lee from kbw please go ahead ph emily q hello hello a hey ph chris we can hear you q okay yeah its ph chris in terms of ira the capital the million by the end of the year and million plus over the next to how do you get to those numbers im just interested to kind of i understand the mechanics of how you would get there but how did you get i guess more importantly to the million plus some of your peers are kind of mid even million ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think look in overall ph chris weve talked a lot about relative to our peers that our allowance and capital ratios we justified them being slightly below where peers are understanding that they still need to be higher than where we are today so i dont know if your question is on kind of the immediate term or kind of where we view ourselves in the long term but if you look at that nearterm expectation column all these metrics reflect kind of organic efforts or things on the margin like what we did this quarter in terms of selling off certain commercial real estate loans at par so theres no significant rash actions that are embedded in the nearterm expectation column and then its a continuation of those efforts over time that gets you over to the righthand column so not sure if thats the answer but q yes that helps ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp okay valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 q just a followup on that would there be any situation where you would do like a credit linked note or some sort of rwa mitigation to accelerate that youve seen some peers do that with success ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i would say that all rwa optimization opportunities are on the table and there are certain portfolios that lend themselves more to that than others but we have a very diverse balance sheet and we have portfolios like auto and residential that could be good opportunities for transactions like that q okay great and then maybe just two housekeeping do you have maybe i missed it the cre concentration metric in the first quarter and then also the quarteronquarter change in the criticized classified special mention i know you mentioned a little bit high level but any specifics there ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah the cre ratio is going to be about so it should be down about from december and mark indiscernible mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp yeah on the migration as we mentioned approximately migrated into criticized for the quarter a little granularity on that disproportionately in office which should not be a surprise with whats going on in the market today q all right perfect thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks chris operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a followup on the yeah followup on the last answer to ph chris question are you guys telling us just to expect higher criticized and classified loans each quarter it sounds like youre doing a deep dive maybe every quarter but how do you want us to think about whats ahead just to prepare us for that mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp this is mark jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp just pointing to what ira spoke to before we did a special review on the sensitive asset classes and overall portfolio touching a little over of the portfolio in the first quarter with a focus on rent stabilized and office so while i anticipate because of the high rate environment that we will continue to have some migration throughout the year we do believe that the first quarter migration was elevated because of the focus of the reviews and the percent of the portfolio that was reviewed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful thank you for that mike can you go over your margin expectations again i think i heard you say that you feel like the margins troughed and were going to get a lift in the second quarter but i just want to make sure i heard that correctly michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah first thanks for asking the question i was feeling left out this morning so thats good jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i dont believe i said the word troughed but valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp let me go back to the first quarter and then ill give you the guidance so generally the first quarter results were in line with our expectations on a day count basis and the modest headwinds as it relates to net interest income were really the noninterest bearing deposits and slower loan growth but those were also offset by some deposit cost reductions that weve spoken about as well and we continue to look at that the guidance being revised slightly down is again a function of a starting point with lower noninterest bearing deposits and again this lower loan growth that we talked about especially when you consider the participations that weve visited about being in the latter part of the first quarter so that impact is in the numbers in the first quarter as much as it will be in the second quarter and then while we did assume fewer fed cuts i would assume most people are doing that remember that long end rates are forecasted to be higher relative to where they were as the start off point in so that on a net basis the shifting yield curve whether its on the higher or the short end is a modest benefit to us because were more exposed on the long end jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right that makes sense to me and ira if i heard you correctly you said with these guidance changes you would still expect relatively consistent ppnr to what you said before these adjustments is that right ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp absolutely jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so its just for us its a question of trying to figure out what the provision is thats and thats and youre just saying some modest growth in the reserve ppnr stays the same just the geography on the income statement is different is that right ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think weve tried to give you some guidance as to where those numbers could shake out but obviously look its market dependent as mark said weve gone through and looked at a lot of the portfolio already that said were going to continue to monitor the portfolio and do the credit reviews we believe that thats really been a strong point for us and the ability to have the significant reviews that we do as its driven down to lower loss given default valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 so its been part of a hallmark of who we are in actively managing the portfolio and not just waiting for something to happen so we are all over every single loan that we have and we continue to really be and as market conditions change well adjust them accordingly jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right fair enough thank you guys appreciate it ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning with all the puts and takes on the loan side that you just discussed and given the fixed rate loan repricing and the of loans being floating rate how should we think about the loan yield expansion from this quarters levels under a three rate cut scenario travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp look i think youve seen the pace of loan yield growth has slowed as rates have stabilized generally on the front end so that immediate benefit has kind of played itself out probably but you do obviously have some tailwinds and when we show you i think in the deck we show that maturing cre slide that may be a good kind of guide to help you in terms of whats coming off and then where youre putting things back on we originated loans loan yields this quarter are still in the high so i think on a cre perspective our cre origination yield was so theres still some opportunity to enhance loan yields there manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right i appreciate that and then you noted that you purchased some ginnies this quarter is there more room to do that and how should we think about the level of onbalance sheet liquidity that you want to manage to over the next few quarters michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so the ginnie mae purchases obviously theyre zero riskweighted they average about three to four years and the yields on that portfolio on recent purchases i should say have been in the slightly more than range the runoff on the portfolio theres really no prepayment so its going to be just the stated maturity payoffs run around million to million a quarter and we would continue to add we believe in zero risk weighted ginnies at probably to yields manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 got it so in terms of the onbalance sheet liquidity you need to maintain from here is there a room for that to move up or do you think youre at the right level and i ask in context of you also mentioned that the ldr should trend below in so i just want to get a sense of what the right level of liquidity is michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i want to make sure im answering youre referring specifically to say fhlb or federal reserve availability ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think overall youre probably going to see a little bit more onbalance sheet liquidity not to a significant degree but part of getting the loantodeposit ratio down to will definitely be a little bit of the core deposits coming on and being reinvested in securities as opposed to going into loans but i dont think you really need to look at a significant shift within what that securities book looks like manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it yeah thats what i was getting to thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from jared shaw from barclays please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah looking at the cre sales that you did this quarter being able to do those at par is great i guess thats a little surprising though just given where rates are that there wasnt even like a rate mark on there could you give any detail on the term and yield of the type of loans that were sold and if there was any retained credit participation on that thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah its tom here these were participations for the most part those participation rates range probably from i think and up fixed side was to they were all participated at par we retained a portion as lead valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 bank on those on the floating side they were mostly primeplus construction loans and again we retained a position in those travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp i think that last point is pretty important too because were preserving the customer relationships and as you heard ira say in the prepared remarks i mean cres a very valuable asset class well remain in it we have a deep pool of highquality commercial real estate borrowers but there are ways that we can balance the need to manage the balance sheet with preserving and building those customer relationships jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then following up whats the expectation for deposit growth from here and then as we look at some of the promotional products that are rolling off where are you seeing those coming on at where is the new product coming in terms of term and price thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp while weve continued to have the noninterest bearing rotation one of the really bright spots has been the growth in the savings now which has more than offset what weve lost in noninterest bearing or rotated into noninterest or out of noninterest bearing into other products and the growth in our niche businesses has been very strong as well and maybe a harbinger of or an indicator of the future growth and the strength there is just in the first quarter alone on a net basis we added over net new deposit accounts so we feel pretty good what im telling you is i think the growth is going to come out of the niche businesses and the continued efforts in our retail branches to grow households and to the extent that we could see a flattening of rotation of noninterest bearing thats only going to help us ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp maybe jared ill add just two different pieces to that last call we talked about at least me specifically some of the disappointment i had and where the funding costs have gone within the organization so we were very proactive in going out and looking at billion of different deposit products across the organization and lowering those from a basis points and that did not happen in the first period assuming that the first month the quarter but it happened throughout the quarter so we think theres going to be some tailwind associated with that as we continue to think about deposit cost that said the new originations came on very very strong in deposits for the quarter the cost was only and theres well over billion of net new originations that came in and obviously some of that offset some of the higher cost time deposits that tom meant or something that mike mentioned that ran off so i think weve done a really good job bringing in newer deposits into the organization at a much lower cost than what marginal cost of some of the current deposits that we have here and weve also been able to be very successful in bringing down some of the cost of deposits thats sitting on the book right now so we believe that theres a lot of tailwind associated with that valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from steve moss from raymond james please go ahead steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp morning steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc just following up on deposits here just curious when did you guys reduce deposit rates by basis points in the quarter thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp there were tranches of deposit classes that we reduced beginning february and then continuing through parts of march steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and so just i guess basically the idea is to see how they hold and if we stay in the current rate environment will you continue to press for additional deposit rate cuts thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yes we manage it weekly we look at the levels and we have not seen any significant change in those levels from the groups where we reduced steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay appreciate that and then in terms of on credit here with the deep dive you guys took on the specific portfolios you guys mentioned that you examined the office portfolio had migration there just curious what is the specific reserve for office and then also along those lines just curious are you looking primarily at the valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 specific properties or are you looking at the borrowers global cash flows im just kind of curious as to how those global cash flows are holding up these days mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp no absolutely let me address the end of the question yeah as part of our standard credit process we look at not only the property that we finance but the overall global cash flow of any of the developers that we do business with to get that overall view to see if not stressed in our property are there stressed and is global or vice versa strength in the global cash flow and weakness in property all of those factors go into the risk rating and the migration in portfolio we dont publish a separate office reserve but as i mentioned earlier we have substantially higher level of reserves for criticized assets and there is an elevated level of criticized assets in our office portfolio thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp and the only thing i just want to add to that is many of our customers are in multiple classes of assets not just in a single class steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc right and maybe just in terms of the office portfolio i think it was times or times i forget the debt service coverage ratio right now but like are a lot of those borrowers in the current environment headed towards times just kind of curious as to how much capital a borrower might have to put up to kind of right size those loans these days mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp yeah and i think you see the granularity in the portfolio with a million average loan size in that we do look in the individual cases with migrated clearly there was stress in debt service coverage on those assets necessitating the downgrade but historically our leverage on office assets and our goingin coverage was exceptionally strong to longterm customers that we have relationships with which we also believe assist in the overall performance of that portfolio in the long run travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp steve we showed the average loan size i mean i dont like to indicate the granularity and diversity of the portfolio but in reality to your last question and it doesnt apply just to office its i think across the portfolio given our average loan size when a borrower does need to bring additional cash reserves or equity into a deal these are low average loan sizes that require less in terms of absolute dollars to right size things and i think thats a benefit and a component of the loss mitigation and credit management steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and maybe just one more related to commercial real estate office are you where youre seeing the migration is it in your larger loans these days or is it across the board valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp so i would say from its really more geographically focused so our largest percentage of office is in the florida alabama market and weve seen much lower level of migration in that portfolio with the majority of migration in the northeast in the new jersey and new york marketplace but noting that our manhattan exposure is quite granular and quite small in this steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay appreciate that and then just stepping back from things here ira i was just curious here with the plan to reduce commercial real estate concentrations it might not be easy to do a deal today but just curious as to how the shift is changing your thinking on the ma front ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp look i think this is the strategic initiatives and plan that weve outlined for a couple years now so i think were just looking at accelerating some of the things that were doing if theres an ma opportunity that helps accelerate some of the strategic initiatives well definitely its something we would look at that said the guardrails around tangible book value are real to me so obviously the valuation in todays market limits the ability to do some of that but ma that really accelerates strategic initiatives is something thats definitely that we are as an organization are open to steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great i appreciate all the color thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question goes to david chiaverini from wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i wanted to follow up on expenses it looks like we could see a decent reduction here could you talk about what areas youre pulling back on and any initiatives that are getting pushed to the back burner ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think from a macro perspective obviously theres going to be less activity in volume in certain loan classes so theres probably going to be some continued reduction in those specific areas but i think a large piece of it goes back to what we talked about last quarter the core conversion that we had here took significant resources from an internal perspective and from an external perspective and as we continue to get the benefits of migrating onto one core platform we do believe that theres going to be some sales from that definitely not to the degree i think valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 that we saw the contraction from last year to now but that said we do think that theres opportunity on the expense side of the book michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and maybe to give you an example to hopefully make this real prior to conversion core conversion we ran on three separate gl systems and we had two different core systems we closed the books this quarter the fastest weve done in the time that ive been at valley so thats a good example of showing the efficiency in the core conversion and how it has ancillary benefits that kind of spill through the whole organization david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that and i also want to follow up on the question on liquidity i guess to put a finer point on it cash and securities as a percent of assets was should we expect that to kind of trend higher here over time ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think slowly over time directionally that makes sense but i dont think theres any bulk action thats going to occur at any point i mean thats just in general direction weve trended higher if you look back over the last couple of years and well continue to do so we have a very stable deposit base its very granular and so we think were well positioned to this today but just directionally too as we grow we will continue to have more cash and securities david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question goes to ben gerlinger from citi please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good afternoon everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hi benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc slide and the debt service coverage ratios were really helpful a modest migration is one to be expect is it fair to say that all of those now include annuals are we still waiting on a little bit im just trying to look for the most uptodate type ratio there valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 mark saeger a executive vice president and chief credit officer valley national bank valley national bancorp on a large portion of our portfolio we do have updated current rent roll information i dont believe of them though clearly include numbers and we think that in all asset classes other than office weve seen strength in noi growth benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and then i noticed some multifamily down here in the southeast is that florida alabama came down a decent amount quarteroverquarter any commentary on that ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp ben well go back and take a look at the number you mean the debt service coverage came down benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah it went from basically ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah it also happens to be the same number no ill go back and take a look at it because it happens to be the same number as the row above and so ill take a look at it and get back to everyone benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah okay and then lastly i know its been a long call and i apologize if youre going to repeat yourself but did you guys give a monthly or aggregated spot rate on deposit cost michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp we did not give a spot rate you can see in the ip that the total deposit costs went from to so theyre up basis points benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp a lot of the deposit cost michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from matthew breese from stephens inc please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey i had two quick followups the first one was just on the taxi medallion charge off what happened there was that part of the credit review it just seems like a fairly big charge given how far away we are from kind of the height of the tax medallion days whats the remaining balance on that portfolio michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp the remaining balance we have million left in portfolio thats fully reserved down to current market prices for the chargeoff that we experienced this quarter that was also fully reserved for it was one relationship of a customer who had been paying we were in a longterm negotiation and kind of hit a standstill subsequent to the chargeoff we have entered into a forbearance agreement and that loan has continued to pay matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay and then just in light of a slower loan growth outlook could you just stack order for us capital deployment priorities and im really curious if share repurchases become part of the plan here even if a little bit the other thing is understanding ira your comments on ma would fdicassisted deals be something you look at should they arise thats all i had thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp look i think from a capital deployment perspective allocating capital to growing the cre book is probably not going to happen here theres ample opportunity internally just to serve our current cre clients so i think thats probably where more of the focus would end up being but once again we are seeing strong ci growth than we have for a couple years now so allocating capital to those specific segments seems to be a much better return to us today from an ma perspective i think once again if its something thats strategic and makes sense we would look at it but once again the guardrails around in tangible book value is some of thats significant to me matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it thats all i had thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator i am showing no further questions at this time i will now turn it over to ira robbins for closing remarks ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks i just want to thank everyone for taking the time to listen to us today and i look forward
