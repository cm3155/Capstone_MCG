blackley chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff capital one recorded a net loss for the second quarter of million or per diluted common share primarily driven by a billion allowance build reflecting the economic downturn related to the covid19 pandemic adjusting items impacted operating expenses during the quarter and totaled276 million or a share including the provision for legal matters as well as costs related to our cyber incident net of these adjusting items our eps was a loss of per share turning to slide ill cover the allowance in more detail the second quarter allowance build of billion consists of billion in card million in auto and million in commercial our allowance is based primarily on an economic forecast derived from the consensus of thirdparty economists that forecast includes capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 unemployment in the second quarter of falling to at the end of and gradually improving over the course of to end at of course our strong credit performance so far shows that the normal relationship between unemployment and consumer credit has been significantly altered by lending hardship programs and especially by government stimulus including direct consumer support through the cares act looking ahead in our allowance weve assumed no such benefit from further stimulus beyond the residual benefits of the existing legislation which starts running out after july on slide you can see the impact of our coverage ratios for various businesses our total allowance coverage now stands at of loans compared to at the end of the year for our domestic card coverage ratio is now and our branded card ratio is 135recall that the primary difference between these ratios is driven by losssharing agreements in our partnership portfolio our auto coverage now stands at and our commercial reserve coverage is moving to slide id like to discuss our liquidity position as weve talked about for years we have always focused on conservatively managing capital and liquidity and thats serving us well as we navigate the covid19 pandemic you can see that our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was up from at the end of the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement our liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity increased to billion at the end of the second quarter including about billion in cash driven by strong inflows of consumer deposits turning to slide i will cover capital our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the second quarter up basis points from the first quarter notwithstanding our large allowance build in the quarter recall that beginning in our cet1 calculation excludes the marktomarket impact from our availableforsale security portfolio at quarterend that portfolio had an unrecognized after tax gain of billion which represents approximately basis points of potential regulatory capital during the quarter the federal reserve released the results of their stress tests our capital requirement under the stress capital buffer framework as calculated by the federal reserve was or approximately basis points below our current capital levels in conjunction with the release of the stress test results the federal reserve also announced an additional fall stress test and a limitation on third quarter dividends based on the average quarterly net income for the prior four quarters while our recent ccar capital plan included a planned quarterly dividend based on the feds new cumulative earnings rule we expect to reduce our third quarter common stock dividend to per share subject to board approval turning to slide you can see that our net interest margin was in the quarter which is approximately basis points lower than the first quarter and the prior year linked quarter the quarteroverquarter decline was largely driven by a shift in our asset mix as average cash increased to billion and average card balances shrunk by in addition to this mix shift the low rate environment further pressured net interest margin with the low interest rate environment and the continued economic uncertainty we expect to maintain elevated levels of cash in the near term during the quarter we deployed approximately billion of cash to increase the size of our investment portfolio prepay federal home loan bank advances and to buy back a portion of our senior unsecured debt in our first ever debt tender offer even with these actions our cash at the end of the quarter was at an alltime high of billion up billion from the end of the first quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 the low rate environment is also a headwind to nim improvement to give you a sense of magnitude our disclosed yearend interest rate sensitivities would suggest an approximately million reduction in annual interest income based on the over basis point decline in the yield curve that weve seen yeartodate looking forward our nim trends will depend on how the impacts of the downturn play out across our balance sheet including asset mix deposit balances and deposit pricing and our cash position and with that ill turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks scott ill begin on slide which summarizes second quarter results for our credit card business the impacts of the covid19 pandemic drove second quarter results across all of our business segments in our credit card business loan balances purchase volume and revenue declined yearoveryear and as scott just discussed we posted a significant allowance build credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide domestic card ending loan balances shrank by billion or yearoveryear while average loans declined excluding the impact of the walmart portfolio acquisition ending loans shrank by around yearoveryear while average loans were down about purchase volume for the quarter declined compared to the prior year quarter looking at weekly trends the yearoveryear decline in purchase volume was down in the second week of april and has since rebounded over the last three weeks ended july the yearoveryear decline has averaged just total company net interchange revenue for the second quarter was down about year overyear the declines in loan balances and purchase volumes are a result of several factors the broader effects of the pandemic consumers behaving rationally in response to the covid economic shutdown and our choices to pull back in marketing and tighten underwriting as theyve done in prior downturns consumers are pulling in their spending and paying down balances this cautious behavior is an important driver of both declining volumes and our strong credit performance revenue decreased yearoveryear revenue declined more than average loans as revenue margin decreased basis points compared to the second quarter of the majority of the revenue margin decrease was driven by the expected impact of the revenuesharing agreement on the acquired walmart portfolio and the revenue benefit in the second quarter of last year from our choice to exit several small partnerships lower net interchange revenue also contributed to the revenue margin decline noninterest expense was down million from the second quarter of last year largely driven by our choice to pull back on marketing provision for credit losses was up by billion yearoveryear as a result of the large coviddriven allowance build second quarter credit results were strikingly strong especially in the context of the pandemic the chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was a basis point improvement from the prior year several factors likely drove the striking improvement credit performance is benefiting from resilience choices we made before the downturn began consumers are behaving cautiously and paying down debt government stimulus is dramatically altering the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 normal relationship between the unemployment rate and consumer credit at least in the short term and widespread forbearance across the banking industry is helping consumers manage through financial stress we are helping domestic card customers who have been impacted by the covid downturn weve provided more detailed information on domestic card forbearance on slide we currently offer a 30day skip pay with an option to renew at the end of the second quarter total enrollments were running at about per week down from more than per week at the end of the first quarter in recent weeks approximately twothirds of weekly enrollments were renewals at quarterend firsttime enrollments were down from the peak in early april as of june about of active accounts have enrolled at any time since the pandemic began however most of these customers have since exited the program at the end of the quarter about basis points of the customer base were enrolled and eligible to skip their next payment and another basis points were enrolled in the program last month and skipped their payment as permitted a portion of these customers may reenroll of all customers who have participated in the program at any point approximately were current when they first enrolled over the life of the program weve seen largely positive customer outcomes for customers ending their first 30day skip pay period more than half have made their required payment in the subsequent month and approximately have reenrolled for another month customers with multiple enrollments have made payments at a lower but still healthy rate slide summarizes second quarter results for our consumer banking business ending loans increased yearoveryear while average loans for the second quarter grew driven by our auto business when the covid downturn began we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient assets two factors drove second quarter growth while the auto market declined sharply at the end of the first quarter it is rebounding the rebound thus far has been stronger for larger franchise dealers the part of the market where were focused and our digital products and services are driving growth in directtoconsumer originations and growth with dealers who want to provide a touchless car buying experience in response to social distancing our dealer relationship strategy and the digital infrastructure and capabilities weve built from the bottom up put us in a strong position to grow highquality auto loans even with tighter underwriting ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear deposit growth was fueled by the stimulusdriven increase in personal savings average deposit interest rate for the quarter decreased basis points compared to the prioryear quarter most of our moves to reduce deposit rates occurred late in the quarter in response to the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics consumer banking revenue decreased from the second quarter of last year underlying revenue growth from higher auto loans and retail deposits was more than offset by differences in the timing of federal reserve rate cuts preceding our deposit pricing moves noninterest expense in consumer banking was up volumedriven growth in expenses was partially offset by our efforts to tightly manage costs second quarter provision for credit losses increased million yearover year again driven by the allowance build that scott discussed our auto business posted strong credit results in the second quarter the chargeoff rate was up just basis points compared to the prioryear quarter to the delinquency rate improved basis points yearover capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 year to this strong performance is a result of forbearance government stimulus cautious consumer behavior resilience choices we made before the downturn began and betterthanexpected auction values we currently offer a 30day skip pay with an option to renew to our auto customers who have been impacted by the downturn as you can see on page enrollments are trending down at the end of the second quarter total enrollments were running at about per week down from over per week at the end of the first quarter in recent weeks approximately of weekly enrollments were renewals firsttime enrollments were down from the peak in early april compared to domestic card a higher percentage of auto customers have enrolled in forbearance as of june about of active accounts have enrolled at any time since the pandemic began however most of those customers have since

as permitted a portion of these customers may reenroll approximately of customers were current at the time they first enrolled over the life of the program weve seen largely positive customer outcome for auto customers ending their first 30day skip pay period more than half have made a payment in the subsequent month and a little more than a third have reenrolled for another month customers with multiple enrollments have also made payments at a healthy rate moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business second quarter ending loan balances were up yearoveryear driven by customers drawing down lines late in the first quarter after peaking in march line draws have subsided second quarter average loans were up compared to the second quarter a year ago average deposits also increased about second quarter revenue was down from the prioryear quarter while noninterest expense was essentially flat provision for credit losses increased million compared to the second quarter of the largest impact was an allowance build driven by the factors scott discussed and by downgrades to credits in industries that are most impacted by covid energy had a modest release this quarter as specific reserves set in the first quarter were converted to chargeoffs in the second quarter weve provided a breakout of our oil and gas portfolio composition and reserves on slide the commercial banking chargeoff rate for the quarter was the criticized performing loan rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked quarters to and the criticized nonperforming loan rate rose modestly to ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results in the quarter and our positioning for the future capital ones second quarter results were driven by the nearterm impacts of the covid19 pandemic a significant allowance build and declining revenue drove negative earnings per share consumer credit trends were very strong we further fortified liquidity and our cet1 ratio increased to based on the new cumulative earnings rule that the federal reserve announced in the quarter we expect to reduce our third quarter common stock dividend to per share subject to our boards approval pulling way up were more than halfway through a year none of us will ever forget capital one started the year with significant momentum then covid19 hit an inflection point in march driving a sudden shutdown of economic activity a sharp increase in unemployment and along with it the biggest and fastest government response since the great depression capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 we are wellpositioned by the choices we made before this downturn started since our founding days we have hardwired resilience into the choices weve made on credit capital and liquidity through good times and bad as a result we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends a fortified balance sheet and deep experience in successfully navigating through prior periods of stress including the great recession our investments to transform our technology and how we work and our efforts to drive the company to digital are powering our response to the pandemic our technology transformation enables us to develop and scale up compelling digital customer experiences as social distancing increases demand for digital engagement automation facilitates rapid changes and enhancement in underwriting and analytics and our cloudbased modern technology infrastructure seamlessly supports a virtual work environment for of our total associate population when the pandemic took hold we took immediate actions to protect the wellbeing of our associates customers and communities and we took actions to manage credit risk and further strengthen resilience we tightened underwriting and pulled back marketing we fortified our liquidity and capital and we significantly built our allowance for credit losses we continue to lean in to resilience to weather this storm with strength and stay ready for opportunities that will emerge as the cycle plays out as we manage through the nearterm challenges we also continue to focus on the things that create longterm value one area of continuing focus is efficiency prior to the pandemic we were on a sustained trajectory of improvement we posted improvements in annual operating efficiency ratio in five of the last six years driven by revenue growth and digital productivity gains while the pandemic has interrupted our progress it has not changed our journey or the milestones along the way based on where we are in the downturn we dont have the visibility to commit to the specific timing but we remain committed to getting to annual operating efficiency ratio over time with further improvements from there covid19 has thrown us and other companies across the economy a big curveball but it hasnt changed where we think our business is headed or the longterm strategic opportunities that will be created as digital continues to bring sweeping changes to how we work how we interact with each other and how we experience the world every day in fact the pandemic appears to be accelerating digital change everywhere we look we believe that our shareholders customers and associates will be wellserved by our eightyear strategic commitment to digital transformation and our steadfast focus on resilience we remain wellpositioned to weather the downturn emerge with strength and deliver shareholder value over the long term and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as always as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any follow up questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call matt please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning or good afternoon actually it feels like morning is still bright over here richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp good afternoon betsy richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah sorry about that a couple of questions just first off i wanted to understand a little bit about the folks who had enrolled but are no longer enrolled you had those nice charts on the auto and the domestic card and i wanted to understand the folks that have rolled off what has their payment history been like and what are you anticipating over the next quarter from them richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so betsy the no longer enrolled population includes all customers who have either made a payment or completed a billing cycle following the forbearance period and have not reenrolled as such it is mostly customers who have resumed regular payment patterns but also includes a much smaller group of customers who have not resumed paying us and are advancing in or towards delinquency you get visibility to customers in that situation through our normal delinquency reporting betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and so my followup is the delinquencies look really good this quarter and we see it every month obviously when you give us the master trust data and the managed data so i guess im wondering why you think theres that disconnect and given the reserve ratio you already have set aside against card and the low level of delinquencies you have do you see much in the way of reserve build in versus richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp betsy why dont we work backwards and ill go to your question on the allowance with the allowance from here its really going to depend on some of the major drivers of our reserve build in the quarter i talked about those being our economic scenario and our approach to stimulus and i feel like those had both a conservative bias capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 when i look at them at this point so i would say that i feel very good about the allowance that weve got today given what weve seen since the end of the quarter but in the future i think its going to come down to if the economic outlook and forecasts get worse then that would lead to an allowance build and then on the other side of that all else being equal if we did see more stimulus that would be a positive to the allowance and we could see an offset to the potential effects of the economic scenario that weve built the allowance on this quarter so i dont have a specific guide for you as to whether we think its going to be going up or down but hopefully that gives you a sense of what may drive it in the future jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator next question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hi there ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe first on the dividend so it looks like the capacity to keep the dividend was higher for so i guess are you factoring in the income test staying in place beyond this quarter and do you expect to maintain the dividend beyond this quarter and then i guess second if we did maintain the it does seem like theres a pretty sizable bounce back in earnings for the back half of the year so can you maybe just clarify whats been baked in and just lastly how quickly do you think you could reinstate the dividend thanks and i have a follow up richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes thanks ryan that was about four questions build into one but let me give you a couple thoughts so on the dividend i think if you did the math which is based off of net income technically i think we could pay about a dividend this quarter we rounded down to and of course thats subject to our board approving that at some point in the future and in terms of looking forward with q4 look at this point i honestly dont know how the fed rules are going to play out into the fourth quarter we dont know how that income limitation test is going to work if theyre going to continue it on you know that theyve instituted a fall stress test for all of the banks in ccar so im not going to give a guide on where the dividends going to be next quarter were committed to continuing to have a dividend i appreciate how important that is to a number of our owners and then i would just say with respect to earnings we do have a net loss for the three cumulative quarters ended q2 i think that we would need to make over billion next quarter in order to pay a dividend whether or not thats going to happen i think is capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 going to be really largely driven on what happens with the allowance and i just talked about some of the drivers there so look i dont mean to not be specific as to whether or not were going to pay it but i would just leave you with we are committed to doing the best we can to make sure that we preserve a dividend ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and ill try to be brief in my second one so i guess rich if you think about it you have a birds eye view of the most impacted verticals consumers via card and auto commercial including oil and gas and some high impacted commercial real estate maybe rank order for us to just talk about your concerns in each of the asset classes where youre feeling better or worse relative to three months ago and then second you talked about forbearance helping in the near term can you just maybe help us understand how to think about that historical relationship between unemployment and losses because it seems like youre reserving for a lot of historical relationships coming to fruition but clearly we could see benefits from the forbearance helping customers make payments as youve showed in the slides richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay ryan so on a little comparison here let me start with how the various parts of our business the industries we are in entered the downturn our consumer business is the industries we felt that were particularly healthy the card business id put at the top of the list in terms of a rational industry conservative underwriting by the players there and the consumer was also given how long and acute the downturn was the consumer was still acting very rationally as well so all of those things are very different from the great recession and how we entered it the industry entered that one the auto business i give it pretty high marks going in for similar reasons a pretty strong consumer and a competitive environment that always kind of amplified and volatized if you will by dealer being an intermediary in the middle but pretty rational we were concerned much more about the commercial business because of practices credit practices and behaviors underwriting behaviors that we saw mostly outside of the banking industry in the institutional marketplace but which its hard to avoid having that impact the commercial banking part of the business as well so since then to me the thing that im most struck by is how strong the yet again the consumer steps up and the rationality of the consumer im so struck by the pulling back on purchases savings rates going way up payment rates which also are kind of a hidden factor in slowing down growth but on the flip side of good credit those behaviors have just been very apparent across our consumer lending businesses and ive always throughout my three decades of doing this building this company been very struck by how rational the consumer is and we see that there the huge sort of elephant in the room on the consumer side and its an elephant on the commercial side as well is what happens to government stimulus and id just think a lot of things have lined up that have softened the impact for consumers even really those who have been unemployed and so we are seeing this great paradox of extraordinary credit performance in the middle of the worst economy metrics in our lifetimes so i think thats a hard one to prognosticate where it goes from here but id give really high marks to the strength of the consumer and i see solid continuing underwriting behavior by competitors in that marketplace capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 commercial is really a blend of so many different marketplaces and so while we have a lot of theres a lot of healthy industries were in and where do we look with concern at the top of our list is energy which was already taking it on the chin before the downturn and is now struggling now even more so with whats happening to oil prices the places that other places the of course in commercial real estate hotel we have very small exposure there thats not a good area were pleased that we dialed back a lot on our retail cre exposure so we feel quite good there we have an eye out on the multifamily side just for what happens with the forbearance programs for example in new york were coming to the end of the 90day moratorium on evictions and the increased unemployment pay so i think there is uncertainty there so its a tale of a lot of different cities in commercial but if i pull way up on just every month as we go through the downturn with strong credit performance thats one more month of progress and it limits it lessens the extent of the downside in the rest of pandemic but weve got the big wildcard as we referred to you see it reflected in our allowance build and therefore were managing in a very dichotomous situation here that is quite extraordinary to experience jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question this afternoon im really struck by the difference between the utilization of the customer assistance programs on the auto side and the card side is that a reflection in the current environment of the utility of a credit card versus the utility of a car or is it a function of the amortizing nature of auto loans versus the minimum payment ability on a card richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp i think theres several things going on there is and you see this affected capital one and you can also see it across the industry theres just naturally a lot more ambient demand for forbearance programs in the auto business than there is in cards by the way you could also add mortgage into that comment that theres a lot of demand there so one fundamental reason is that auto payments are typically much higher than card minimum payments and so theyre just more likely to be beyond the reach of the given customer whose income is disrupted and within both businesses not just as we compare across the two businesses but within both businesses weve seen a strong correlation between demand for forbearance programs and the size of the payment due the second reason i think also in that auto the stakes are higher for the customer and theyre very motivated to make sure that they can keep the car so were not surprised by these differences one thing that i think is just a point an investor point here is that because a relatively small number of our card customers have in fact raised their hand to opt into programs and so many of them are already getting out of them i think youre able to have a really clear pretty darn clear window into the credit performance of capital one even inclusive of the forbearance programs capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 its a little harder to because the auto forbearance numbers are larger its not quite as clear in terms of where the credit numbers over time will go even though we are certainly very bullish about how well the program is performing but i think what im i sometimes feel investors are a little bit throwing their hands up and say in a period of with all this forbearance going on as individual companies how are we able to read the credit metrics i think there is a high level of clarity on the card side in particular at the moment richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and that actually segues perfectly into my followup which is that when we look then at the reserve or the allowance levels for each of the product the implied loss frequency on card is substantially higher is the way to think of that the longer this persists there is more embedded risk in the card portfolio richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well i think that the loss rates on card are higher because its unsecured product rick i also think that when it comes to the auto business we have fairly high levels of recovery on the collateral there and then in the reserving that weve done this particular quarter in auto a portion of that was actually driven by the growth that we saw there so i think theyre just different asset classes with different characteristics and certainly the average card book has higher losses than what we see in our auto book jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator the next question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you im glad you guys are doing all right i guess i have a twopart question so my two questions on pre provision earnings scott maybe you could just outline how you see the nim and revenue unfolding over the course of the year and maybe any other expense mitigation efforts you might have and then secondly as far as loan growth is concerned rich talked about the improving trends in purchase volume youve also had some of the auto finance other auto finance players talking about oem production increasing and that might lead to more dealer inventory to sell loan growth could you just talk about broadly sort of loan growth as it unfolds over the rest of the year thanks richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp so sanjay ill start off on some thoughts around nim and it certainly feels like nim is kind of at the low end of where i would expect it should be for our company and theres a few factors driving that which i talked about in my comments in talking points but if you think about where that might be going in the future id say a couple things so first of all were working really hard to continue to deploy more of our cash into higheryielding investments whether thats the investment portfolio where i think we can put some more work there offsetting wholesale capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 funding maturities those are some examples but candidly given the current rate environment where we are in this downturn i would anticipate that cash levels are going to remain high until we start to see some stabilization there so well try to make some progress but i dont think well be able to really change that dramatically on the asset mix effects certainly the decrease in card this quarter was a big headwind on our net interest margin i think depending on what happens with our opportunities in the market where we feel comfortable continuing to step in those will be major drivers of what happens to nim going forward and then on the deposit side i think the benchmark rates have fallen more than what weve seen in our pricing and as rich talked about in his talking point some of our pricing actions happened late in the quarter so well see the full benefit of those coming through next quarter which should be a tailwind for nim i also think that were starting to see betas accelerating across the industry and i think theres probably more opportunities for continuing to price down deposits at this point in the cycle so thats kind of where i see nim going from here sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc loan growth richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp on loan growth look i think that that is a bit of a question mark about how this pandemic plays out and where we see opportunities weve obviously found that theres some great opportunities in auto in ways that we feel comfortable with our origination strategy and what were seeing in there with respect to card theres certainly pockets where we think we can continue to acquire new accounts and well have to see how payment rates play out because thats a major driver in what happens with outstandings weve seen great credit part of that is high payment rates the flip side of that is that that has a tendency to drive down outstanding so on loan growth i think that were a little bit kind of looking at what is available in the market is going to drive our behavior and its the time now to be cautious but we also are always looking for opportunities to take advantage of spots where we see the market available to us jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi scott i know theres some concern around economic weakness in the south and southwest more recently have you seen anything that would suggest theres some pressure and also on the forbearance in cards looks like it may have ticked up a little bit i was just curious if thats continuing to hold steady richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so don we have not seen any big geographical effects we certainly are on the lookout for them i think the government stimulus and the forbearance thats generally going on in the industry has sort of moderated credit capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 issues broadly across all the geographies with respect to forbearance theres a reasonable amount of variation by state in a way thats intuitive given the differential impacts of the virus so far so for example in our card business florida new jersey new york certainly earlier on have been states with some of the highest enrollment rates so the forbearance thing matches intuition pretty closely richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp okay the other thing i would just say on don just one more comment on your question about regional differences a lot of the information that were looking at tends to be backward looking and so as this pandemic is evolving we havent seen anything specific with the south or the southwest just yet but that may be because were looking at backward facing data and there may be more coming donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess you had mentioned theres no additional stimulus built into your reserve build the extra average weekly unemployment is pretty material would you agree that that could have a material impact on your chargeoffs if that were not extended richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well thats a big part of why our allowance builds have been the size that they are is that we have certainly seen that there has been an effective income replacement with a lot of the unemployment benefits that you talked about as well as just other directtoconsumer stimulus and to the extent that that unemployment is an offset with other programs or even forbearance our allowance is built on a premise that that would translate into higher losses at some point in the future jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator next question will come from eric wasserstrom with ubs eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc thanks very much rich or scott my question is about the loss curve my own model is showing in a very usual and very unusual shape which is that that its pretty flat through the third quarter then stairsteps higher in the fourth as some of the deferral actions abate and then stepfunctions higher again in the second quarter of next year when the gse deferral abates on the assumption that some of those deferred cash flows are going to service other kinds of debt so can you just give me a sense of what your own view of the loss curve looks like and whether it looks unusual relative to jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp eric excuse me eric eric im so sorry were having a great deal of difficulty understanding you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay can you hear me better now jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp its still a little muddled im so sorry eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc is it any better now jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp thats much better eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay sorry about that my question was just about your expectations for the shape of the loss curve whether in fact it still looks like a curve or more like a stepfunction as different levels of forbearance abate whether its your own or whether its things like gse forbearance which may influence how other asset classes perform richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp eric one of the challenges that we faced in our allowances this is the exact point that youre bringing up weve got a delinquency inventory that has incredibly low delinquency embedded in it right now and an unemployment forecast thats suggesting that thats got to normalize at some point how thats going to work out i think is going to really depend on what happens with stimulus if we do see some of the stimulus just suddenly drop off i think we will see some cliff function around that starting to translate into delinquencies whether or not how forbearance impacts that im sure that therell be some tempering with forbearance that will continue on in those periods but i would anticipate that the lack of stimulus would be the major driver in terms of where loss curves would look like here in over time as those benefits weigh off eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you and then my followup is just on opex rich obviously good to hear about the reinstatement of the efficiency target but has there been any change or incremental actions or anything incremental to the prior target that youre looking at given the current circumstances richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so eric there are natural forces in a sharp downturn like this that pressure the revenue trajectory certainly with the purchase volume declines the demand for card loans drop and interest rates fall so the pressure is certainly coming on the revenue side so in terms of what were doing the actions that were taking we talked about were tightening our extension of new credit were pulling back on marketing and these things naturally put pressure on loan growth capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 so kind of to your point so first of all on the revenue side its not a binary thing to us that well theres a downturn so therefore one hunkers down we have a lot of experience over all these years living through downturns to us all of our choices are very very segment and microsegment specific so theres going to be a real gradient with respect to how we lean into growth opportunities in this environment but i dont want to leave the impression that were just solely in hunkerdown mode until the pandemic ends but what we have done is we kind of started the downturn with a pretty broad pullback as the world was kind of in vertical freefall and then we have really carefully assessed by segment what are we getting as the what kind of information we have that can help us predict how consumers are going to do in this particular pandemic what are we seeing with respect to adverse selection or in a few cases maybe even some paradoxical positive selection that you sometimes see in a downturn like this so our energy is particularly focused on the response the differential response were doing during the pandemic and leveraging the information we have including the ability to get a bunch of information in realtime because of our tech transformation in order to find some good revenue opportunities on the expense side we have really tightened up on hiring for example thats a very natural thing to do and we have done that we are meeting very frequently just working on overall how can we manage our expenses really tightly and this is all in the context where were still importantly making the necessary investments to managing the pandemic response we dont want to certainly cut back on that we still expect to benefit from the exit of the data centers later this year all of that is unaffected by the pandemic and of course in terms of the total efficiency ratio the reduction in marketing is a good guy for total efficiency ratio so when we look at what it was that drove us to target of annual operating efficiency ratio all of those same factors and the things happening with our business model and the success in technology and all of that all of that is still entirely intact with respect to the business model this is all about timing at this point and so weve pulled back on the timing of our commitment to that target but the energy and that what led us to achieve the kind of success we have on the efficiency side what led us to achieve the tech success and all the things that have gotten us where we are on the credit side all of that energy is that were all in on that eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator your next question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i guess scott or rich could you talk a little bit about when you think about the level of reserves going forward you talked a lot about scott talked a lot about stimulus a couple of times but assuming that thats going to be one item but when you think about changes is it going to be changes in unemployment or how much can the consumer behavior that youve seen thats a positive impact your kind of expectation for how much reserves are needed or is it just going to be based on that employment number capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well i think moshe thus far a lot of the consumer behavior is driving what were seeing in terms of credit performance so thats a huge part of it some of thats stimulus but i think some of it is just disciplined behavior by consumers and by a lot of our competitors in the industry as i think about going forward i do think that as i talked about earlier i think stimulus is going to be a major driver of what happens with the reserve but i do believe that the consumer has had that experience from the financial crisis a lot of wisdom that has been learned there and weve seen a lot of discipline in that regard so im not sure that as i think about where the allowance is going while unemployments going to be a major driver i think that some of the other factors that weve talked about and rich mentioned several of them in his talking points are going to be important offsets there in terms of what might happen in terms of the relationship between unemployment and credit losses as we go forward moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay and following up on the previous question about marketing i mean its kind of pretty stark when you think about it you probably have i dont know north of a decline in credit card marketing in the quarter and youve got volumes actually up doubledigits in auto can you talk a little bit about what youre seeing in the two markets that kind of make that the right way to go right now and what would make you want to start marketing again more actively in the card space richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so moshe let me just talk a little bit about auto and then move to credit card so we actually in both card and auto our first response was to tighten underwriting and we have had a tighter credit box in both of the businesses there are a number of things happening in the auto business that sort of are causing better high quality volume to come capital ones way even with the tighter credit box and so were scrutinizing very very carefully with everything about what we see in this volume and the early performance but i wouldnt underestimate the importance of the digital capabilities that we have that have been helpful during the pandemic but we will have to see what competition does overtime and were going to again really really carefully scrutinize what comes in there is also in the auto side particularly in certain segments of the business ability to have a lot more information in realtime which can allow one to have more clarity on the customers condition situation and with a better guess then on how they may perform so on the card side typically in underwriting there is less information available its an unsecured loan of course and were even at a time where the reliability of credit bureau information is likely less over this period of time just because of certain things about companies not reporting on forbearance during this period of time so that also make things a little bit more challenging now the flip side of that moshe for us where we have been we always talk about the origination lever and the credit line lever are two separate decisions and weve always said that for a lot of our business the real exposure comes on the credit line side not really the origination side so we have been more leaning in on the origination side and the conservatism has particularly come with respect to credit lines and as you know from having watched us manage that through time were trying to continue to build the potential energy as carried by the originating new accounts pulled back for the time being on the credit line and then trying to get as much information as we can on each customer and watching very carefully their situation over time really open up on capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 the credit lines but the loan growth will come more on the credit line side and that is a lever and a dial that we are going to be managing along the way during the downturn so the net effect of all of that is something that ends up with at this point higher volumes in card and then the final point i want to make is the relationship of course between marketing and all of this because dialbacks in marketing tend to therefore generate lower volumes so early on in the downturn like most of the other players we dialed back in marketing what we are doing is like everything is not a one size fits all but its going to be a sloped level of marketing by channel by segment by product but were hopeful that we can generate some good origination results over time by a very sloped differential customized effort on the marketing side jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc afternoon thanks very much for taking my question rich a pretty high level question and you touched on some of the components of the answer it is but i figure id still ask it anyways youve managed this business through a variety of different downturns and pullbacks and recognizing that this one is much different than any and they all are different i suppose at this point of the downturn how do you see yourself as prioritizing different objectives and what kind of opportunities might come out of that if you can compare and contrast this one to say the last few downturns richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp a few things about this downturn that are different again i think on the consumer side significantly more healthy consumer and marketplace going into this one than the last one so the last one had to work its way through so many kind of structural problems on the way to getting to the other side of the downturn it made the last great recession that was tough so its a cleaner situation on the consumer side of the business the really striking thing about this downturn is how immediate it was you look back at the great recession i mean lots of the indicators were there in but this was a rolling downturn that took a lot of months and even sort of measured in years to play out in this one im so struck by the fact that everybody sort of goes down the elevator at the same time were talking about consumers were talking about companies who serve them banks and the government so because of the vertical drop down the elevator where its not clear what floor its going to stop at you saw such a conservative response by consumers that the flip side so thats bad for volumes but really good for credit health and savings and all the aspects of that that is really striking in comparison to any downturn ive seen before because of the vertical drop youve also seen companies really mobilize in very rational ways and pullback much more quickly than they did in the downturn and that leads to a healthier situation as well and then i think the vertical drop allowed the political environment to coalesce around significant stimulus program that would be so difficult if this were a rolling months to really fully get into this thing so that to me is what is so unique about this capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 and so now its led to this really extraordinary kind of paradoxical situation where the actual performance of the customers and im especially talking about the consumer business the performance is so strong but the economic numbers are so bad how these things play out is really going to be driven by choices that happen on the government side or perhaps the collective forbearance choices that will be made by the banking industry and beyond but another thing that i think is important just as a mental thought here is with think about a metaphor of a downturn tends to have worsening is like a big mountain things go way up and then they come down with every month of solid performance by the consumer in a sense were burrowing a tunnel through the mountain and every month that passes as you get through the mountain in some sense all other things being equal it can serve to limit some of the downside that can come in even as theres a fairly rapid ascent if some of the stimulus for example is removed but in all of this i find this very energizing times from a business point of view to look for where are the risks where are the differential opportunities how can we capitalize on the ability to do realtime underwriting and leverage a lot of data in that as a payoff of our tech transformation and leverage three decades of experience but also really understand what is unique about this downturn and i think thats where were spending so much energy doing right now and i think across our businesses theres going to be a very sloped kind of amount of growth or shrinkage depending on the unique opportunity john hecht q analyst jefferies llc i appreciate the thoughts my other questions were asked and answered so i dont have a followup thank you richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you john jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator and our final question of the evening will come from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good evening strange times indeed ie most of the questions on credit but i guess rich i think just one thing i tend to agree with your comment that the longer this goes the less risk i think on the consumer side do you think that the stimulus and the consumer reaction has essentially covered some of the chargeoffs that would have occurred they will not occur because of the stimulus funds that were available and then it seems that some people think that companies such as yours dont make any adjustments to the underwriting side what percentage of your current borrowers in the credit card business are unemployed and when youre making underwriting new loans i would assume that new loans dont go to people who are unemployed you dont extend credit lines to those that are generally unemployed but do you also carry that further and look by industry and say well delta air lines is about to layoff half of their workforce we probably should be more conservative with airline employees so just some thoughts on whether you think those charge capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 offs are permanently removed because of stimulus potentially and then just some comments on the underwriting how many of your current borrowers are unemployed and how you have changed underwriting richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so i dont think we have a rigorous measure of how many of our current borrowers are unemployed but since we have a big chunk of america i think that our borrowing base is reflective of america and there are a lot of people that are in different degrees of unemployment right now and so even as theres such great credit performance right now what were obsessing about is is kind of looking beyond that to a number of the things that youve talked about about how to underwrite with as much information as we can and as wisely as we can past performance is not necessarily such a great predictor of future performance at a time like this but we call our whole strategy at capital one the informationbased strategy this is a time where data really matters and so were putting a lot of energy into that very thing along the lines of a lot of things that youre talking about so marshaling as much information as we can leveraging the capabilities capital one has built having data is one thing getting data and leveraging it in realtime is another thing and thats one of the things that weve been focused on with respect to our technology transformation and then finally how does one also in a world where you cant be certain on the underwriting side how do we put other mitigating protections in in the structure of how we build our products and the lowline strategy that capital one particularly is beneficial at a time like this originating with lower lines and saying well wait for a while on the line increase side of things but we will continue to originate the account subject to the tighter credit loss we talked about on the auto side we have invested very heavily in realtime informationbased underwriting and like i said earlier the amount of data available in the auto underwriting process in realtime compared with card is a whole level higher i mean its partly an industry point and partly some of the particular places that weve gone at capital one and so i think that with some of the clarity that were able to see particularly well there we can make some good choices but also were able to put in more structures more protection stronger pricing into the underwriting that is just thats a very important thing in addition to just the prediction of the underlying risk of the consumer themselves robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc great appreciate your answers and have a good evening richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp all right
