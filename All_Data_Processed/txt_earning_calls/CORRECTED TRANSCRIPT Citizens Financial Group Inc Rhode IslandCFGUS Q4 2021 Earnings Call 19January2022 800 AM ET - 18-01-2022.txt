few of the financial headlines and let john take you through the details for the quarter our underlying earnings per share was and our return on tangible common equity was sequential operating leverage was thats exacquisitions and sequential growth in ppnr was a strong leading our performance was an unbelievably strong quarter in our capital markets business led by ma and loan syndications we built a great business through hiring top talent in combination with several acquisitions and our approach to market is really clicking for the quarter we were number one in the league table for middlemarket sponsored transactions and number four for overall middlemarket we only had jmp results for six weeks of the quarter but were very excited about how theyll augment what weve already assembled our highlights for the quarter include strong sequential loan growth of on a spot basis exppp while average growth was and thats exppp commercial growth and a pickup in line utilization were bright spots and we entered with a good jumpoff point we did a nice job on expenses pulling across our top efficiency saves to help offset higher incentive comp tied to revenues and credit remains pristine as good as it gets our capital position remains strong with cet1 ratio of giving us a great deal of capital management flexibility in we have the capital and liquidity to fund the attractive loan growth we expect to see in while looking for selective acquisitions and ensuring strong returns of capital to shareholders with respect to our guidance for we assume solid economic growth of around several fed rate hikes and improvement in loan demand our top six and top seven programs should allow us to keep expense growth exacquisitions below and were targeting positive operating leverage including the bank yield scheduled to close soon an almost exppp impact credit is expected to continue to be highly favorable and id expect our return on tangible common equity to move over in the second half of the year potentially reaching in q4 so all in all a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by citizens in and we feel we are wellpositioned to do well in and continue our journey towards becoming a topperforming bank id like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in we know we can count on you again in the new year so with that ill turn it over to john citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone first ill start with the headlines for the quarter we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was which included the impact of a credit provision benefit revenue of billion was up linkedquarter given strong growth in fee income average loans are on a solid in the quarter before the impact of ppp forgiveness led by retail which is up by and growth in commercial overall spot loan growth of for the quarter excluding ppp provides good underlying momentum for loan growth this year linkedquarter fee growth was or before acquisition including outstanding results in capital markets driven by record ma fees and loan syndication as weve executed well and gained market share and excluding the impact of the two commercial feebased acquisitions ph that we closed in the second half we delivered underlying positive sequential operating leverage of approximately this quarter with wellcontrolled expenses we recorded a credit provision benefit of million which reflects strong credit performance and the improving economy our yearend acl ratio stands at above our day one cecl level of we continue to have a very strong capital position with cet1 at after returning million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter next ill provide some key takeaways for the fourth quarter while referring to the presentation slide net interest income on slide was down given lower net interest margin partially offset by strong loan growth the net interest margin was down basis points reflecting a reduced benefit from ppp forgiveness and lower earning asset yield given changes in loan mix and spread compression partially offset by the impact of the lower cash balances as we redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth we also made continued progress lowering our interestbearing deposit costs which are down basis point to basis points on the bottom left side of the page you can see we remain highly assetsensitive at the end of the quarter with an overall sensitivity of to a gradual 200basispoint rise in rates at the end of the year about of our sensitivity is geared towards the short end so we are wellpositioned to benefit when the fed begins to tighten referring to slide we delivered terrific fee results this quarter demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses with outstanding results in capital markets reflecting our longterm investments in the business and solid performance across other key categories we set a new record for quarterly capital markets with exceptional strength in ma advisory and loan syndication amid a backdrop of good market activity we continue to gain market share and have nice momentum as we enter we also delivered our best quarterly results of the year in fx and irp which are up linkedquarter given an increase in currency transactions driven by robust ma activity and an increase in client hedging given the outlook for rate raises mortgage fees declined in the quarter against a backdrop of strong competition and excess industry capacity we saw ongoing pressure on gainonsale margins particularly in thirdparty channels and seasonally lower production volume mortgage servicing income improved as our thirdparty servicing book grew linkedquarter to billion card fees were stable as debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed prepandemic level while fees citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 also remained strong service charges and fees were modestly lower reflecting the impact of citizens peace of mind our new customerfriendly deposit account feature we are seeing these changes drive clear benefits in customer experience as customer satisfaction is up and call center volume is down since we implemented the changes on slide expenses were wellcontrolled excluding the impact of the feebased acquisitions that closed in the second half of the year noninterest expense was stable and we drove linkedquarter operating leverage of about these results reflect higher incentive compensation tied to strong capital markets revenue and strategic investments which was balanced by strong expense discipline and the benefit of top efficiency initiatives periodend loans on slide were up linkedquarter or excluding ppp we were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth of more than excluding ppp retail loans are also growing up average loans were up and up more than excluding ppp retail strength was driven by mortgage and auto commercial originations were very strong exceeding prepandemic level led by corporate banking subscription line financing supporting dealrelated activity and assetbacked lending after line utilizations levels ticked up last quarter we saw a larger increase of about basis points to on a spot basis this quarter primarily driven by dealrelated financing activity we continue to expect a gradual recovery in utilization over the coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investment such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve in addition our periodend commitments are up a very strong which will benefit us as investment continues to pick up on slide deposit flows continue to be robust especially in lowcost categories and our liquidity ratios remain strong average deposits were up linkedquarter and yearoveryear with strong growth in demand deposits which now make up of total deposits up from last year interestbearing deposits were broadly stable as the continued runoff of higher cost of term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and lower cost categories we continue to make good progress on deposit repricing with interestbearing deposit costs down basis point to basis points during the quarter given the changing tone of the fed and the potential that they may begin to tighten early this year we thought it would be helpful to make a few points about how we see our deposit costs behaving in the next rate cycle first we have made significant improvements to our depositrelated capabilities since the ipo our enhanced data analytics capabilities allow us to optimize the deposit base by attracting more stable deposits with targeted offers and by employing more dynamic pricing we also have the added lever of citizens access which has proven to be a very efficient deposit channel and we have strengthened our commercial offerings and invested in enhanced tools to drive higher operating deposit secondly our mix of lower cost deposits is much better with demand deposits now of the books compared to at the beginning of the last rate cycle and consumer cds which were at of total deposits at the end of the last cycle are now down to which is below peer levels also note that the hsbc branch acquisition will add almost billion or to our core deposits when we close this quarter lastly we have vastly improved our overall liquidity profile with a lower ldr and much lower deposit costs than when we entered the last upcycle when you add that all up we are confident that our deposit base will be meaningfully lower than the prior cycle moving on to credit on slide we saw excellent credit results again this quarter net chargeoffs were broadly stable at basis points for the fourth quarter a good performance across the portfolio nonperforming loans citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 decreased linkedquarter with continued improvement in commercial other credit metrics continued to improve as criticized loans were lower and internal ratings upgrades exceeded downgrades moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio remained strong at at the end of the fourth quarter after returning million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and closing the jmp acquisition on the bottom right of the page we expect a 22basispoint impact to cet1 from the pending hsbc acquisition and the isbc transaction will be effectively neutral given the stock to be issued in the deal shifting gears towards business strategy a bit we thought it would be useful to have brendan and don discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway and how we are poised for strong and sustainable growth brendan over to you brendan coughlin head of consumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks john good morning everybody on slide you can see weve dramatically transformed the consumer bank since the ipo and have a strong foundation to propel us into the future let me share a few highlights were acquiring customers at a pace that far exceeds the pace of household formation in the us nearly doubling our customer base from approximately million at the time of our ipo to million today further our mobile engagement is up yearoveryear closing gaps to peers and allowing to thin our physical network by another this year about since our ipo this enables us to reinvest in growth strategies weve built one of the most diversified consumer lending businesses in the us giving us a number of additional levers for revenue growth and customer deepening that many of our peer banks lack weve transformed our deposit book repositioning our deposit mix quite significantly with strong dda growth which has really driven down our cost of funds by about compared with the time of our ipo finally while we have more work to do our wealth business has been repositioned for growth and our aum is more than three times the size at the time of the ipo so five years ago we were very much a traditional regional only bank we have strong momentum in the business have broadly caught up with peers and in a number of places have built bestinmarket capabilities that have led to differentiated growth rates moving on to slide and looking forward we prioritize several strategic initiatives that should help us deliver abovetrend revenue growth adding about billion by the year five first we expect to leverage our acquisitions in the new york metro market to grow share and deepen relationships we will pick up almost million new customers who have been underserved given that their current banks dont have the breadth of product capabilities that we have there is strong upside that we can replicate in new york what we have done in our core markets like philadelphia and boston the second area is wealth where we have a great opportunity as well we recently attracted a new and strong leadership team with a long track record of industry success our regional footprint at our bank customer base is highly attractive and provides significant opportunity for sustained growth citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 third our citizens pay offering is unique amongst all the industry players in the fastgrowing buynowpaylater space we were early movers in the space starting with the apple partnership in we built a very strong position now with partners weve added industry verticals and have remained focused on gaining marquee partners providing good momentum and with a strong pipeline for lastly our national push will be led by our digital capabilities and that includes our efforts to build on the citizens access launch in and the integration of our full range of products and services on a modern cloudbased platform well continue to add products to the platform in and well aim to drive improved customer deepening well also leverage the strategy to accelerate our technology transformation of our core bank as we ultimately aim to converge the operating platforms into one national digitalfirst structure now let me pass it over to don donald h mccree vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island okay good stuff brendan and let me shift to our commercial priorities which are on slide weve got some great talent to the commercial bank on both the coverage side as well as the product side and were able to do more for our customers over their life cycle than ever before weve been near the top of the middlemarket league tables helping corporate clients and private equity sponsors access capital through private and public debt and equity markets and weve integrated our cash management and global market solutions well with our coverage teams on the coverage side were expanding geographically and moving upmarket into the middle corporate space where it is critical to deliver deep industry expertise our jmp acquisition which closed late last year gives us a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology healthcare and financial services plus we gain an equities business that is very well run focused and highly regarded and were already seeing great crosssell dividends off of it as nonbank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continue to increase weve broadened our capabilities to better compete successfully in the new landscape we will increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base given these expanded capabilities its also worth noting that willamette the transaction we closed midlast year dramatically expands our valuation services business with a very prestigious outfit this capability is highly synergistic with our ma and broader capital markets effort and has annuitylike qualities so you can see the success weve had in building and scaling up our businesses to deliver more than just traditional banking products to our clients we are highly confident that this will continue to drive sustainable and growing revenue streams over to you john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks don on slide youll see some examples of the tremendous progress weve made against the key strategic initiatives that brendan and don mentioned and other work were doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make citizens a great place to work we are very excited to see how our digitalfirst approach citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction moving to slide ill touch on our top program even as we tended to offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions it is important to remember that a key to citizens success since our ipo has been our continuous effort to realize efficiencies and reinvest these savings back into our businesses so we can serve customers better weve effectively wrapped up our top program after achieving our targeted pretax runrate benefit of approximately million at the end of now we have launched top with a goal of an exit runrate of about million in pretax benefits by the end of we are really doubling back to mine areas where we have already been successful for example continuing our multiyear journey of digital transformation across consumer and commercial looking at further organizational streamlining accelerating and building on our nextgen tech initiative and doing more in the cloud were going to focus on ensuring our agile operating model and take another look at our vendor spend as well based on the work weve done so far we feel confident that we can deliver on this new program moving to slide we did a lot of progress on the esg front last year and we will continue to make meaningful progress in a few highlights for the launch of a new green deposits program to allow corporates clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to create a positive environmental impact we adopted targets to meaningfully reduce our scope and scope greenhouse gas emissions we have a strong commitment to social equity and our colleagues continue a tradition of being highly focused on volunteering in our communities to serve our clients better we introduced new deposit account features that help customers avoid unexpected overdraft fees and we immediately saw changes that indicate a meaningful improvement in customer experience this should help attract and keep more customers with the bank and now for some highlevel commentary on the outlook for fullyear on slide first let me be clear that this is a standalone outlook that includes jmp and willamette which closed late last year but does not include any benefit from our pending acquisitions of hsbc and investors the bottomleft corner of the page includes information that should help if you were trying to also layer in the expected contribution from these acquisition in for we expect nii to be up to driven primarily by midsingledigit average loan growth excluding ppp we expect nii to grow highsingledigits driven by highsingledigit average loan growth average interest earning assets are expected to be up slightly as excess liquidity is deployed into loan growth the rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of january and includes three implied fed rate hikes of basis points each in april july and december on the long end were planning for the year treasury to be about by the end of the year the rate curve benefit on net interest margin will allow us to more than offset the impacts from the lower ppp forgiveness and swap revenue while presenting meaningful upside to nim in and beyond fee income is expected to be up to given continued strength in capital markets and wealth following record performance in noninterest expense is expected to be up to given the fullyear effect of our commercial feebased acquisition or up less than excluding the impact of these acquisitions we have included an expense walk on slide that lays out the drivers citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 credit is expected to remain excellent with net chargeoffs broadly stable to down slightly and provision expenses less than net chargeoffs and we plan to continue operating with a cet1 ratio within our targeted range of to which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividend in the second half of the year on the lower left of the slide youll see our expectations for the pro forma impact of hsbc and investors with eps accretion of about based on consensus at the time of announcement and approximately million in additional ppnr to our results importantly we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately on an underlying basis for the year including hsbc and investors and if you set aside the impact of ppp that would be a very strong operating leverage moving to slide ill cover the outlook for the first quarter we expect nii to be down about despite solid loan growth given a million smaller contribution from ppp and an million impact from lower day count including the impact of hsbc nii will be broadly stable for the quarter average loans are expected to be up to with interest earning assets broadly stable fees are expected to be down to reflecting seasonally lower capital markets fees than the record we delivered at last quarter as well as other seasonal impacts noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately given the seasonal compensation impacts and the full quarter impact of the jmp acquisition net chargeoffs are expected to be broadly stable with provision less than net chargeoffs and we expect our cet1 ratio to last at around including an impact of about basis points from the hsbc transaction which we expect to close in midquarter to sum up with slide we feel that we finished with a great quarter and entered with strong momentum we have a winning strategy we are building capabilities organically and through acquisitions that deliver value to our customers and growth for our shareholders our strong leadership team will continue to focus on execution and building a topperforming bank with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john operator lets open it up for some qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the questionandanswer portion of the call operator instructions your first question will come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities your line is open now peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i had a question one thing i hear i get from investors is the potential for deal risk noise just between the hsbc and investors bancorp and then also the investors loan mix being heavy in commercial real estate so the question is is there a need to remix the loan portfolio with investors and lead to some nearterm revenue headwinds and just potential volatility closing both deals in the first half of the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island let me start and john you can jump in so its is bruce peter i think were working really well and hard to make sure that these deals come off very smoothly customers have a good experience and we can introduce our approach to banking right off the bat and take advantage of i think some really great synergy opportunities so weve set up a separate integration office weve had outside help helping us through and with dedicated teams to make sure that we get off to a good start so i dont really see any disruption from smoothness of operations i think that will come off very very well were monitoring the performance of both businesses and they seem to be performing to our expectations so thats also a good fact we will end up taking on more commercial real estate exposure when investors closes however most of that is in multifamily and the kind of risk of that portfolio is relatively modest in terms on the spectrum of commercial real estate risks so i think well look to grow our other loan categories faster over time which will bring that exposure back into more alignment of where a targeted balance sheet would be but we dont think therell be any need to do any dramatic surgery or anything that would disrupt the momentum that we have in loan growth so ill stop there and john if you want to add anything to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats well said i would just add that as it relates to the operational side of things weve got a number of mock conversions and dress rehearsals that have gone extremely well the last one is i think next citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 weekend so were right on schedule for hsbc for that closing conversion in middle of february so thats really sort of wellhandled and were deep into the planning on investors as well planning for legal day one planning for customer day one planning for conversion and those plans are also well in sight and appear well able to be executed on the balance sheet aspects that bruce mentioned just reemphasizing our front book originations will look different than the back book the back book has the multifamily loan portfolios as bruce indicated but that front book is going to have a lot more ci and a lot more consumer lending going forward than investors has had in the past so with that ill go ahead and leave it there peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very helpful and then if i could just ask john im wondering could you quantify the impact to net interest income for every 25basispoint rate hike and what youre assuming for the deposit betas john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah im going to talk about that i think we are highly assetsensitive and thats built into the guide for nii for based on the jan curve and as you know since then the curve has increased a fair bit as of just looking at it where things ended up yesterday so theres more upside in if the rate environment continues to unfold as were seeing it in the last several days but as it relates to the actual sensitivity the way that shakes out is that on the were mostly sensitive to the short end and that will drive about million if theres an extra basis points on top of the forward curves as of january well generate another million per quarter on that on the short end and well get another million to million per quarter on the long end versus the january forward curve for an overall million to million per quarter of additional benefit if you have basis points that require bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island as a parallel shift john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah a parallel shift up from the january curve as it relates to deposit betas i mean this is a very exciting story weve completely transformed the deposit franchise since the ipo and i would say that as i mentioned in my remarks i think that our deposit betas are going to be meaningfully lower in this next cycle and of course we should start off the cycle theres a lag and weve got that lag built in but we also have some betas built in but i would say that the betas at the beginning of this cycle are going to be much lower than the betas that we experienced at the beginning of the rate life cycle last time around given all the investments we made in product capability in pricing and approach and with the added lever of citizens access so were really excited about being able to demonstrate the strength of the deposit franchise in this cycle going forward bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 yeah just to quantify that a little bit if you look at the last move up on fed funds and then you compare to if that happened today wed probably be a third less in terms of our deposit betas than we were last time around john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks very much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies go ahead please ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys thank you for the detail on the merger updates and the timelines i was just wondering can you just give us a sense of at what point do you expect to get both converted and do you have an understanding of when you think youll get to kind of full runrate cost saves from the combination of hsbc and isbc john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start as it relates to were targeting to the end of when well have substantially all the synergies done and as i mentioned were going to close and convert hsbc here in february the expectation is our target is to close investors in early first quarter early april and i would say the way to think about conversion is that thats not going to be a big bang approach were going to see that conversion happen throughout on a staged and phased basis throughout assuming we close in early april youll see a couple of platforms close throughout and into the end of and there could be some stragglers into the early part of but again its not going to be a big bang were going to move certain platforms over as they become ready to go and i think for as an example mortgage and wealth are two platforms that will go early and the overall core would happen later so maybe ill just maybe turn it over to others if they want to add any color to that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island no i think thats right john ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and my second question is just on i know youve said very clearly that you wouldnt expect to update capital targets and such until you reach your mediumterm goals im just wondering so should we think citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 how should we be thinking about share repurchase in terms of getting through closings and any anticipations you have about anticipating this year ccar process with you getting back into it in john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill just start off and as you may know i mean weve talked about this before our capital priorities start off with the dividend and supporting organic growth and feebased boltons and so we want to put capital to work in that manner and to the extent that those opportunities leave some of that capital around then we engage in buybacks which we did this quarter or this past quarter as we articulated in our remarks so i mean i think were coming into ccar season and we tend to on an annual basis take another look at capital targets and what the trajectory of capital return will be we also have the deals that are pending so i think youll get a we can be a little bit more sort of give another update on that as you get into the first quarter call bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and ken just from a technical standpoint we had an authorization to buy back million of our stock and weve used about million of that todate and we have million left for this year which should give us plenty of running room when we get through ccar you might see us do an adjustment to that but anyway thats a little bit of a framework that were operating under ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes operator your next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey john pancari q analyst evercore isi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 just on the loan trends clearly the commercial trend came in very solid and better than expected i just want to see if you can give us a little more granularity on where youre really seeing that strength and the drivers i know you mentioned deal financing are you seeing capex plans start to drive some drawdowns there and then separately just in terms of the endofperiod loan balance it looks like theyre a few billion above the average balances and so therefore the endofperiod balances is good leading indicator into outlook as we model this out john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island maybe ill just start off and don can weigh in here i mean i think as we mentioned corporate banking and subscription line finance and assetbacked lending all contributed and it has been an excellent quarter and there is momentum with spot balances higher than average so thats right john i would say when you split it out we are seeing last quarter we saw a tickup in utilization from our sort of breadandbutter corporate banking clients this quarter we saw another tickup in that sense a lot of the increase was driven by deal financing but we are seeing some underlying tickup maybe basis points last quarter another basis points or so this quarter maybe ill just turn it over to don to add any additional thoughts donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah no i think thats right i think the big macro is our origination volumes are just huge record quarteron quarteronquarter and theyve been offset by payoffs as people ph have gone out of the capital markets or and in particular real estate a lot of properties are trading so were being taken out of loans due to underlying property sales but were really encouraged by what were seeing on the origination side the subscription line business that we have is really going quite well and its growing quite quickly some of the deal financing that happened in the fourth quarter will be refinanced out in the capital markets probably which is good for us well participate in that but we think the trend continues the other thing that we are seeing is a lot of activity in our real estate business on the origination side were seeing quite a bit of warehousing quite a bit of industrial quite a bit of life sciences and then increasingly buildtosuit office believe it or not so investment grade corporates building new office space to occupy postpandemic in terms of working capital and capex and things like that its really hard to kind of discern how quickly thats going to happen youve got the new supply chain challenges youve got some of the labor challenges youve got some of the international countries shutting down so its kind of fits and starts but we think its it feels pretty good to us overall john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks and then bruce just a question from higher level i know youve certainly been acquisitive here in adding to your business both on the banking side as well as cap market could you just talk about from a banking perspective the need for scale and the whole debate that do you need to be able to compete effectively and more specifically do you think ultimately you need a national franchise thanks citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure so i like our size john so i think we have enough scale that we can compete against all comers we have to be extremely disciplined we have to prioritize well we have to leverage external parties our principal core application vendors we have a lot of partnerships with fintechs but we do a really good job there and were moving the company to be a digitalfirst bank and i like the progress there so one of the advantages you have if youre not super big youre not in the mega bank weight classes that you can be more nimble and you can move faster and you can stay focused on the things that really matter so scale does help to some degree so doing this new york metro play and picking up another billion of assets i think is a positive but we dont feel compelled to have to run out and do more deals to stay competitive and was there a second part of your question john john pancari q analyst evercore isi well it was just do you believe you need a national presence including some brick and mortar bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah right yeah so there i think we had a pretty unique opportunity because we have a deposit franchise thats national with citizens access we do have consumer lending activities that are national and weve basically gone to market in kind of a productsiloed fashion without a fully comprehensive platform that allows us to deliver a full range of products and services to customers so thats been really our focus and they put it under the umbrella of national expansion we think theres a really good opportunity to migrate to a cloudbased digital platform that delivers great customer experience then leverage that to target specific very highly specific customer segments where we think we have a right to win and when we look at what we do really well in our regional core footprint thats massaffluent customers particularly young professionals we have a great offering there it starts with our student loan refinance product and we dropped a bunch of things in around that so we think we can target that segment around the country once we pull this all together and make some real headway what goes with that is right now were largely alldigital with that national play we will pick up some branches in the washington dc area when hsbc closes in some in south florida thatll give us an opportunity to go digitalfirst into those markets combined with a light physical presence and do some test and learning because there may be other attractive cities around the country where we have a concentration of customers indiscernible so we have more brand visibility where we might decide to open some branches and then see how that could augment our push to really attract those customers and gain primacy with those customers so a lot to play out on this but its very exciting i dont know brendan if you want to add anything to that brendan coughlin a head of consumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island well said i guess just the color as that ties into scale for me is well we dont feel like we are required to get scale i think the digitalfirst world is providing an opportunity to scale distinctively with revenue and my opening citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 remarks as part of our call script you see us going from million customers to million sic million customers since our ipo i would argue that in a pretty digital world that was not possible without ma activity and weve got a demonstrated track record of scaling our consumer business organically and so thats what you should think about as we bring together all our product capabilities nationally is how do we get scale and provide distinctive revenue opportunity without necessarily needing to do a big ma acquisition we have confidence we can do that obviously were supplementing that with hsbc and investors but really we think we can get great customer growth and deepening organically the big question is do you need physical presence over time and what does that physical presence look like and can you run it with a thin network to bruces point around piloting in washington dc and florida and then potentially other markets over time but all path lead to the next months or so were really building on our exceptional mobilefirst digital platform nationally and then we can start to think through our distribution opportunities over time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay okay great thanks for taking my question operator your next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead please gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning bruce john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bruce can you i share your bullishness on the outlook for the industry and you folks as well and you presented it very well today but at the same time were always looking over our shoulders so when you guys sit around the conference room table to talk about the outlook what are some of the risks that youve identified that maybe could kind of delay or interrupt this bullish outlook bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah to me gerard its usually around the macro would be the principal risk so as the macro goes it certainly has a big impact on bank results it looks like the kind of omicron wave is not as lethal as feared and it hasnt interrupted business and commerce and peoples behavior as much as it could have as much as prior waves did citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 so i put that as a tick in the plus column although you never know what could happen later on over the course of the year i do think the fed has as a fine balancing act to achieve here and bringing inflation under control inflation is really something to be feared and the fed is going to aggressively combat that and hopefully they apply the medicine in a good pace with good kind of forewarning and the market adjust to that and it doesnt kind of snuff out the signs of a good recovery we think that gdp could grow at but what could happen if the market doesnt respond well to those rate increases or if the equity market falls a bit because of that so thats another thing i think that the fiscal situation seems stable at this point its going to be hard i think to pass more legislative initiatives that increase fiscal spend and i think the spend that we have built up from prior rounds of fiscal stimulus is sufficient to carry us through so anyway those are some of the things that we watch i still feel that the fundamental underpinning is very good and the credit outlook is very good so i think theres a strong probability that this turns out to be a good year but theres always that tail risk that stuff could happen and thats the thing that we watch carefully gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for those insights and just to follow up john on the guidance the noninterest income i think you highlighted that you expect the mortgage fees in to be weaker than correct me if im wrong there but more than offset by the strength in capital market whats your outlook because the capital markets number as you guys pointed out was extraordinary in the quarter i assume youre not expecting that to be a run rate but can you give us some color on what youre looking for in the capital markets line in versus and also the mortgage banking piece john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start off and turn it over to don and brendan if they want to add any further color but i mean i think we had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter taking share and just kind of climbing the league tables as a result of a multiyear kind of meticulous investments organically with some feebased boltons that are coming together and frankly havent really fully achieved this potential in some respects in terms of synergies from the deals that weve done et cetera that are going to contribute in so id say that the momentum in the backdrop is still strong bruce mentioned that the macro is one of the areas as long as that keeps going we do see some very solid momentum in the cap market business ma and loan syndications where the lead in and the pipelines look very good into early in terms of what we can see there ill make a comment on mortgage and then maybe just see if don and brendan want to add but i mean on mortgage i would say the way to think about that is yeah itll be down but i still think that given the investments weve made and the share that weve been able to take well be above prepandemic level so the base year i think you can think of as being a year where were well solidify normalize a bit in terms of volumes and id say that maybe the markets down but our volumes will be down less than that margins are still a bit under pressure in particular in the thirdparty space in production but that is meaningfully offset by whats going on in the servicing side of the business where you see continued increase in ph upvs for us citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 and as the rate rise is starting to take off here a little bit you see lower amortization so you put all that together and youre going to have continued contributions from mortgage that will be greater than prepandemic so maybe ill just turn it don if he has anything else to add indiscernible donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so my perspective is assuming the market stay strong and we expect them to stay strong so think of a relatively low interest rates lots of liquidity in a reasonable economy thats a great backdrop for continued deals we saw a lot of things try to run to the finish line in the fourth quarter due to potential changes in tax laws but i have to say our pipelines are as high as theyve ever been as we roll into the in the first quarter and we expect those to continue to build the other thing id just give you perspective on is weve got a diversification of revenue streams now in our capital markets business and that is furthered by jmp which moves us into the equity business as an industry interesting industry verticals and then we have dh capital which should close sometime in the first quarter maybe early second quarter which would give us incremental opportunities and thats only just beginning to be realized and the thing thats really driving the fee lines is were playing multiple roles on every trends there are lots of transactions now so not only are we advising but were also financing and were capturing the wealth business and theres a lot of very good crosssell and a lot of value add for our clients so it feels very strong i think weve got a increasingly strong reputation with the private equity community particularly in the middlemarket space as we show them these interesting opportunities and we execute well for them so it feels very good what the exact number is going to be its very hard to tell but sitting here in the second week of january im pretty optimistic about what the year is going to look like brendan coughlin a head of consumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and on mortgage id just add that obviously ph going up at a high level as you all know mortgage is a natural hedge against the interest rate environment for us and while in many ways the cycle is a lot like other cycles the difference is that was exacerbated significantly so you got a much bigger pop just given how quickly everything came at us and covid and you got a steeper decline having said that johns point we feel much better positioned than precovid levels in i think youll see in our results in despite us projecting the mba and projecting market down we should outpace our performance in and thats with the backdrop of margins at historically low levels so i think the question for us is how much better would we be over time than our precovid run rates and a lot of that will have to do with how quickly margins renormalize as capacity leaves the system were starting to see that now as rates tick up lenders are starting to shed capacity we have not yet seen margins stabilize but will certainly turn around but we expect that to happen at some point question is does that happen in the first half of this year second half of this year well see but we feel very good that the underlying strength of the business is significantly better than levels bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 let me just close we give everybody a shot here everybody commented to your question gerard but if you just think about the long term amplifying dons comments about where were positioned the commercial bank and capital markets in particular feel really really good about what weve built out and the secular trends theres in big private equity pools of capital theyre increasing their ownership of us companies and were very well positioned to cover those companies and provide services to them and with the big middlemarket and mid corporate space that we have we have an opportunity to connect the intermediation of capital from private equity to corporate america and thats a trend that i think is going to stay in place for a long time and were extremely wellpositioned to capture that and drive revenue growth so we like what we put together and i think were still scratching the surface of the potential of really gaining the synergies that come from what weve assembled and then to follow up on brendans point it was always important for us to really get a profitable and highly respected and good mortgage business in place because if we want to be in our consumer bank a trusted advisor on somebodys life journey the mortgage is incredibly important product to individuals and so weve now accomplished that so we feel good about what weve done on the capital market space and what weve done on the mortgage space its been a combination of organic investments as well as inorganic acquisitions the one place that were still kind of short of the mark that we havent moved so to speak to the other side of the river and get where we want to get to is in wealth and its not for lack of trying so weve made significant organic investments there weve had one successful acquisition with clarfeld advisors sic clarfeld financial advisors which has gone very very well and were still in the hunt to see if we can put more together there to get us where we need to get to gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i appreciate all the insights thank you operator your next question will come from terry mcevoy with stephens go ahead please terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc a question for john could you just update us on the size of citizen access sic citizens access and maybe how do you best use that product in a rising interest rate environment and then the hsbc online platform will the conversion there occur on the same pace and same timeline as the bank itself john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so with respect to the first question on citizens access yeah were in that kind of billion billion range most of that is weve had some runoff in terms of the cd book bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island intentional citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah intentionally yeah i mean so when we went out with that that was a balanced approach in terms of savings and cd offer and that was extremely successful in the third quarter of and its really served us well and were building on that platform weve launched a national storefront on the back of that platform where weve added the ability to start bundling mortgage and education loans in that storefront when you log onto citizens access and so over time that will be again a big driver of how we are distinctive with our deposit offerings and being able to broaden out that product set and then the second half of the question was on hsbc bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island basically coming across on timing john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and so that timing is midfebruary we feel really good about that i think the thats almost billion of deposits in the middle of february and so thats going to add a lot of cash to where we are at the end of the first quarter and that really should be thought of though in the context of the investors acquisition where we look at those deals as one sort of entry into the new york metro not just strategically but also financially because when you put those two banks together thats around an or so of ldr combined profile so those deposits are there to be thought of in the context of the overall investors and hsbc acquisition bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island brendan maybe you could just kind of carve out the online aspect of hsbc because that was another thing that really was intriguing when we had the opportunity to acquire that business brendan coughlin a head of consumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah absolutely it does help us further accelerate our national scale with our online deposit platform and to the question the timing on the online integration will be the same exact timing as the core branch network acquisition and that will happen again theres a few small differences with the hsbc online platform from our citizens access one is that the interest rates are actually a lot lower theyre at basis points versus our citizens access is at basis points and one of the reasons why theyre a little bit lower is that a handful of those customers have some minor connectivity to their physical channels and so were maintaining that and making sure that customers have access to our new distribution footprint where they happen to be in our franchise so you can start to see the physical and digital worlds coming together in the strategy but we view this as a significant accelerant to our national expansion plans and provides a great pool of customers for us to ultimately deepen with as we to johns point weve expanded this storefront with mortgage and student loan refinancing as i mentioned in my opening remarks were going to add more products over the course of so this is fertile ground for revenue growth that we did not put into our deal model citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and then just a quick followup can you just remind us the impact on service charges and fees in expected from the rollout of the peace of mind product the citizens peace of mind brendan coughlin a head of consumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i can take that so the way to really think about this is opportunity cost of not reinflating and so the peace of mind program really is a 24hour grace of the third or fourth move weve made in addition to a handful of other movies including a student account that is completely protected from overdraft weve got overdraft pass weve got a once a year indiscernible automatic forgiveness for customers in certain products and now weve introduced peace of mind which is essentially a 24hour grace period and a great customer experience for all of our customers to empower them to avoid unnecessary fees and we think the payback on this is quite strong we about year three where we break even and turn the corner for the revenue benefits to offset the fee shortfall that were giving up but really we expect the overdraft line to be flattish going forward it would have cost we would have been able to get a top of you know call it million to million a quarter in a normalized market where stimulus benefits burned down but we think its the right its the right thing to do bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island about a million opportunity brendan coughlin a head of consumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island about million opportunity cost annually but thats more than offset over time with revenue benefits and to johns comment weve already seen a significant early indicators of positivity coming from our customer base call center and complaint volume are down about in this category and our nps score particularly with under 40aged customers has really started to increase right away and we just rolled this out in october so were very very pleased about it about the early behavioral impacts from our customer base terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks everyone bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay it looks like thats the end of the queue here for qa i know its a busy day
