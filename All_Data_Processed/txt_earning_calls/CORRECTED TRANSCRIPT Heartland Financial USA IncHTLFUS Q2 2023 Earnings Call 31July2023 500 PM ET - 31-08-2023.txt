call over to bryan mckeag chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon as bruce described we continued to move forward in a challenging environment this quarter reporting earnings per share of loan growth of over million and a stable albeit more costly deposit base in addition to the two to the items bruce mentioned in his comments i would mention two other items this quarter the charter consolidation restructuring cost of million and the of loss on sale of securities before i go into more detail i want to remind everyone that our second quarter earnings release and investor presentation are both available in the ir section of htlfs website ill start my comments with the provision for credit losses which totaled million or million higher than last quarter this quarter the provision consistent with last quarter incorporates an economic outlook that anticipates a moderate recession developing over the next months net chargeoffs increased this quarter to million million of which is related to the previously mentioned customer overdraft and directly impacted the provision most of the remaining million had previously been reserved for in prior quarters and as such did not impact the provision at the end of the quarter total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments decreased million to million or of total loans compared to last quarter moving to the balance sheet bruce already discussed loans and deposits so ill start with investments investments declined almost million to billion representing of assets with a total with a tax equivalent yield of and will generate cash flows of nearly billion over the next months with approximately million next quarter the unrealized loss on the afs portfolio worsened by million this quarter to million our relatively small htm portfolio of million or of investments has an unrecorded negative fair value mark of million we utilized nearly million of cash flow this quarter from the investment portfolio to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings moving on to borrowings total borrowings declined million to million or of total loans total assets sorry the reduction was primarily in customer repos and we had less than million of fed advances heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 outstanding at quarter end to summarize our liquidity profile at quarter end we have billion of cash flow coming off our securities portfolio over the next months with million next quarter we have a low level of outstanding borrowings and billion of available capacity at the fed and fhlb we have several fed fund borrowing lines and brokered deposit sources that remain open and available our customer deposit base is granular and welldiversified with over of balances either secured or collateralized our loantodeposit ratio is and when removing wholesale deposits it remains low at we have cash and unpledged available securities totaled totaling over billion and lastly the holding company cash position stands at million or times our current annualized interest and dividend payments in addition our dividend payout rate is relatively low at of current eps with regards to capital regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier at just over and total riskbased capital of nearly adjusted for unrealized losses on our investments the ratios remain above wellcapitalized level at approximately point and the tangible common equity ratio increased basis points to at quarter end the decline in market values of investments was partially offset by an increase in fair value swaps this quarter resulting in a net decrease of basis points from accumulated other comprehensive income or aoci moving to the income statement starting with revenue net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million lower than the prior quarter and the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis fell basis points this quarter to the main drivers of the decrease were million of premium writeoffs related to a higher level of purchased sba loan payoffs that were received and processed during the quarter which reduced nim net interest margin by basis points and a continued shift in deposit balances from lower costing nonmaturity deposits to much higher cost in time deposits reduced net interest income by nearly million and decreased net interest margin by basis points noninterest income of million this quarter was up million from the prior quarter excluding security losses core noninterest income was up million to million which exceeded our expectation of million to million strong capital markets fees were primarily the driver again this quarter shifting to expenses noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter thats down million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses the run rate of recurring operating expenses increased million to million coming in higher than our forecasted million to million the increase was driven by million higher depositrelated advertising costs and a million increase in professional fees due to several items most notably higher legal costs for credit issues and an increased consulting activity level compared to last quarter looking ahead to the rest of htlf expects to see loan growth of million to million or per quarter and customer deposit growth of million to million or per quarter achieving these loan and deposit growth expectations would enable the bulk of investment cash flows to be available to decrease wholesale deposits the net interest margin is expected to stabilize near our june run rate in the low to mid on a tax equivalent basis provisions for credit losses are projected to range from million to million per quarter obviously any declines in market conditions and projections could impact future provisions if a worse than moderate recession develops or credit quality metrics decline significantly heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 core net interest noninterest income that is excluding investment gains and losses is expected to be million to million per quarter recurring operating expenses are expected to be in the million to million range per quarter our charter consolidation restructuring costs are forecasted to be between million and million per quarter over the next for the next two quarters and finally we believe a tax rate in the to range excluding new tax credits is a reasonable run rate and with that ill turn the call over to bruce bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you bryan abigail i think were ready to open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now conduct our questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc good afternoon jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co just a question on i guess the slide your beta slide it looks like the total deposit beta at just under any thoughts on where that terminal or peak level would be and kind of timing of that as you guys forecast bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc bryan could you take this bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah like you said so far weve been at about if you move up to customer deposits its thats the one we can really manage jeff heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc so i think were doing pretty well there if you look at what happened this last quarter it was pretty high at over so we in this last cycle or two have had to really follow the rate increases at least on a percentage basis given the competition our belief is and our hope is that now this next raise and if there is another one that we can get back to more normally a 30orsopercent deposit beta for the next raise or two and which would keep us probably in that to range in total cycle for our customer deposits and thats about normal for us in a total cycle move so i think thats reasonable but really depends on competition jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so you think youd kind of bounce along the top side of that and maybe rein it in in coming quarters is that did i capture that right bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah so slowing down to maybe that beta here in the next move or two ph on that whatever that calculates out to but that should keep us within our normal beta move for customer deposits i think jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it thanks bryan and then just to jump in gears to the charter consolidation i get a sense for i think youve talked about million annually what amount of saves have been achieved todate and maybe ill just leave it there just what percent have you got to so far bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc bryan do you want to take that one bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah i think i would its hard expenses tend to be a little bit ph to use the term right goo theres a lot of things that go in and out that its hard to isolate whats just related to consolidation as we move forward our goal and i think if we can get the leverage that if you look at our slide we were down i think in the fourth quarter we were down close to or on our core cost per asset thats what were shooting for so weve got about half to threequarters of it i think today and i think its going to come at the end when we can finally get to one bank and were doing things one way across everything so little ways to go but a lot of that is in bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 so jeff i think bryan was right i think our number is between million and million of the million is already in jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it and bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc so we had another million to million to go jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and that aligns with maybe end of year i mean you talked about the expectations or bryan did about expenses for the next couple of quarters is that kind of the charter cost kind of that stops and fully achieved by yearend is that generally speaking the expectation bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yes all the costs will be gone by the end of the year jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thanks ill step back operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon guys thanks for taking my question bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc bryan you talked about the assumptions on the nim going forward maybe in low to mid320 range what type of assumptions do you have baked in there is that assuming the fed futures are accurate and we may be done with the rate hikes and then from the noninterest bearing deposits coming down at what are you thinking where are you thinking that goes in that low to mid320 outlook bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 yeah i think its a fairly flat assumption on the nonmaturity deposits and we might need this we might need to keep this last move at that beta so we can get just a little bit of nim help itll be it wont be a lot only basis point or basis points but that basis point or basis points in this environment is a lot so we need both this last move to kind of come through a little stronger on the earning the income side than the expense side and then we need to hold our noninterest bearing deposits relatively flat we did a decent job last quarter if you look at customer deposits they only went down percentage point of the mix so hopefully we can hold somewhere in that range bruce i dont know if you have any other comments around thoughts around that bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so david when we think about kind of our modeling its being able to fund the loan growth with deposit growth as weve mentioned we think million to million of loan growth we think we can grow deposits plus or minus million and then the other thing that happens with that is as bryan referenced when you include the wholesale funding its but if you take the wholesale funding out its is demand and if were able to take all of our cash flow off the investment portfolio and pay down the wholesale funding by million that shift helps us as well david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it makes sense thank you and then separately more of a bigger picture strategy question but theres a lot of disruption in the industry now after the events from march within htlf how much time would you say is spent focusing on offense versus defense and then how does that compare to maybe how much time youre spending on offense versus defense a year ago bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc great question david id say right now were probably on offense and id say a year ago we were probably so were still spending a lot of time on offense and part of that is just outreach to our existing customers and to prospects were spending almost all of our time doing that and when you think about offensive i would also include recruiting were very active in the market recruiting talent as well david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you very much bruce appreciate taking my questions operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch with piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good afternoon heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc good afternoon andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co just wanted to follow up on the margin here some of this margin stability also benefit from the earning asset mix if youre reducing securities book by another million and that helps reduce some of funding side so just maybe a better earning estimate is that also helping the margin there bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah thats bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc bryan bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thats part of ph this yes bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it i think like thats probably bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc go ahead andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co i was going to say that it seems like if youre going to take out another million for the next few quarters that trend should have should remain consistent for the at least in the next year and then if you have that plus an eventual stop in the fed raising rates i mean where do you think the margin ultimately bottoms out when you think it can start rising again heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thats a good question again if we can pull off what we think were going to be trading out deposits at on an average should be probably today in what the mid if its all cds it will be a little bit higher but if we can get a blend and hold our deposits and that will fund loans that are now in the upper to and then if we can take the investments and use that to pay down youre taking probably and paying down costing deposits so all of that is positive to the nim so but to me its all about the deposit side can we hold the deposits and can we hold the betas that we need to so that whole kind of moving parts can happen if that doesnt happen you will see the margin probably continue to slide a bit how low could it go if that happens i would say without doing a lot of math i think it could be a little bit basis points basis points more but thats a lot of moving parts so bruce i dont know if theres anything obviously comes in mind on this question bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i think yeah andrew for us its all about doing what we did this quarter in opening up all those net new accounts over on a combined basis and continue to grow the new relationships and being able to fund the loans with deposits were able to do that were able to actually grow our margin and that andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it all right thats helpful bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i mean thats the entire strategy that we have thats why were playing so much offense thats why we were spending the advertising dollars and were definitely seeing the account growth andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it just on the fee income side does the increase in the service charges the new customer accounts contribute to the uptick there bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc i would say probably not a lot yet but they will andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 especially on the commercial side the uptick in the service charges is where as bruce mentioned the visa we had a onetime visa andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co all right yeah bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc kind of bump annually bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc but they still grew even excluding that almost million so theres a lot of good momentum in our service charge business andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it yeah makes sense all right thanks for taking my questions ill step back operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good evening guys how are you doing bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi bryan thanks for all the forwardlooking commentary maybe my first question i looked at the annual meeting presentation and you talked about recruiting and hiring in markets i guess the question is how has the market disruption from march assisted you or maybe worked against you on the hiring front and then last week when i think about that bank merger that was announced theres a lot of overlap with your markets and could that presents an opportunity for you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so terry ill take that one so the comments both in at the annual meeting as well as whats been going on since the annual meeting denver is clearly one of the markets weve been very successful in in recruiting also in arizona and a couple of others so were on that path and we clearly think that the disruption on the heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 acquisition will help push some of the people over the edge there was a lot of loyalty to the one bank where we have a lot of overlap and i think now just in the last week weve seen some activity there terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then a question for nathan what are you monitoring and looking at within the ci portfolio any areas youre deemphasizing and theres some red flags and yellow flags nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah we feel pretty good about our ci portfolio especially it really continues to perform weve had a couple of oneoffs we continue to launch but really if were just looking at the industry there id say probably focusing on the ones that might be most susceptible to potential downturn so contractors constructionbased firms and other type service providers are probably getting the most focus now terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of damon delmonte with kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys i hope everything is doing well today so just to kind of follow up on the credit topic just wondering what your maturity schedule looks like for commercial real estate loans over the next few quarters do you have a lot coming up for renewal bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc no not really its one of the real positives for us we really do have a very elongated maturity schedule i think we even have that highlight in our investor day which you can see there but id say about of our portfolio from the cre general cre portfolio is going to mature over the next year and a half so very little the vast majority of it is in outyears much further out around the ph to range damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats helpful thank you and then bryan with regards to the expense guide should we anticipate the advertising expense staying elevated like we saw this quarter or does that kind of come back in during the next couple of quarters heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2023 bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc probably going to stay about where it was maybe a little bit lower but id say about where it is damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah damon this is bruce i would say probably for the third quarter it will remain where it is well probably begin to reduce it a little bit in the fourth quarter at least thats been our history damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then should we also think about the outside services line item coming down as well because of some kind of onetime things that occurred this last quarter bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah thats where we need to focus thats one of the discretionary items that we need to get and theres lots of pieces in there so it takes a lot of different areas but thats where i think we need to focus damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc indiscernible million or so out of there if not more damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thats all that i had thank you very much bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks damon
