management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases third quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of these results include a billion net credit reserve release which ill cover in more detail shortly as well as an income tax benefit of million adjusting for these items we delivered an rotce this quarter touching on a few highlights it was another strong quarter for investment banking including an alltime record for ma and while loan growth remains muted we see a number of indicators to suggest it has stabilized and may be poised to begin more robust growth across the company and particularly in card and consistent with last quarter credit continues to be quite healthy in fact net chargeoffs are the lowest weve experienced in recent history on page we have some more detail revenue of billion was up million or yearonyear net interest income was up with balance sheet growth and higher rates primarily offset by mix and lower cib markets nii and nir was up driven by solid fee generation across investment banking and awm largely offset by net securities losses in corporate versus gains in the prior year and lower revenue in home lending expenses of billion were up yearonyear on continued investments and higher volume and revenue related expenses predominantly offset by lower legal expense and the absence of an impairment in the prior year and credit costs were a net benefit of billion driven by the reserve release but its also worth noting that net chargeoffs of just over million were approximately half of last years third quarter number lets go to reserves on the next page we released billion this quarter driven by less severe downside scenarios as the macro environment continues to normalize reserves stand at billion which still accounts for elevated uncertainties surrounding covid and the current labor market dynamics including the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits now moving to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of down modestly primarily on higher rwa the firm distributed billion of capital to shareholders this quarter including billion of net repurchases and the common dividend was increased to per share with that lets move on to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of billion including reserve releases of million on revenue of billion down yearonyear deposits were up quarteronquarter indicating some deceleration as excess deposits are stabilizing notably contributing to this growth we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on the fdic data and were the only large bank to show meaningful share growth up basis points yearonyear jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 similarly client investment assets were up yearonyear and while market performance was a driver retail flows in both advisor and digital channels were strong touching on spend combined credit and debit spend was up versus the third quarter of and in line with last quarter within that data travel and entertainment spend was up versus and very closely tracked the patterns of the delta variant within the quarter softening in august and early september and reaccelerating in recent weeks card outstandings were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter benefiting from higher new account originations and while the payment rate is still very elevated its come down from the highs and revolving balances have stabilized and when we look inside our data we see evidence of excess deposits starting to normalize and segments of the population that traditionally revolve so as a result were optimistic about the growth prospects of revolving card balances moving to home lending average loans were down yearonyear but up quarteronquarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments it was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly billion up yearonyear reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market and in auto we had billion of originations second only to last quarters record so overall loans exppp were up quarteron quarter on the growth in card and home lending i just mentioned expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by investments in the business including marketing and more generally we continue to see that the acceleration in digital adoption during the pandemic has persisted with active mobile users up yearonyear to almost million so with that looking forward we are encouraged by our household growth and balance sheet trends however we expect it to take some time for revolving credit card balances to return to prepandemic levels given the amount of liquidity in the system in the meantime credit losses and delinquencies remain extraordinarily low in card on a yeartodate basis versus low chargeoffs more than offset lower nii next the corporate investment bank on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up versus the prior year and down sequentially ib fees were up yearonyear driven by strong performance in advisory and equity underwriting and we maintained our number one rank with a yeartodate wallet share of and advisory was an alltime record quarter benefiting from the surge in ma activity and we almost tripled fees yearonyear in a market that doubled debt underwriting fees were up driven by an active leverage loan market primarily linked to acquisition financing and in equity underwriting fees were up primarily driven by our strong performance in ipos looking ahead to the fourth quarter the overall pipeline is healthy and the ma market is expected to remain active and if so ib fees should be up yearonyear but down sequentially moving to markets total revenue was billion down compared to a record third quarter last year notably we were up from driven by the continued strong performance in equities and spread products fixed income was down yearonyear due to ongoing normalization across products particularly in commodities as well as an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in our derivatives portfolio equities was up a record third quarter with strength across regions and reflecting higher balances in prime strong client activity in cash as well as ongoing momentum in derivatives in terms of outlook keep in mind that it will be a difficult compare against a record fourth quarter of last year but the current environment continues to challenge our ability to forecast revenues wholesale payments revenue of billion was up or up excluding gains on strategic equity investments and the yearonyear growth was driven by higher deposits and jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 fees partially offset by deposit margin compression securities services revenue of billion was up primarily driven by growth in fees on higher market levels expenses of billion were flat yearonyear as higher structural and volume and revenuerelated expense as well as investments were offset by lower legal expense and credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by the reserve release i mentioned upfront moving to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear on higher investment banking and wholesale payments revenue record gross investment banking revenue of billion was up primarily driven by increased large deal activity with continued strength in ma and acquisitionrelated financing across both corporate client and middle market banking expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly due to investments and higher volume and revenuerelated expenses deposits were up sequentially mainly driven by higher operating balances and loans were down quarter onquarter ci loans were down but up excluding ppp driven by higher originations and its also worth noting that consistent with last quarter we are seeing a slight uptick in utilization rates in middle market and those among larger corporates seem to have stabilized albeit at historically low levels cre loans were flat with modestly higher originations in commercial term lending offset by net payoff activity in real estate banking finally credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by reserve releases with net chargeoffs of basis points and then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of record revenue of billion was up yearonyear as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by higher performancerelated compensation as well as distribution fees for the quarter net longterm inflows of billion continued to be positive across all channels asset classes and regions with notable strength in equities and fixed income aum of trillion and overall assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows and finally loans were up quarteronquarter with continued strength in custom lending securitiesbased lending and mortgages while deposits were up sequentially turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million including million of the million tax benefit that i mentioned upfront revenue was a loss of billion down million yearonyear nii was a loss of billion down million primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued and we realized million of net investment securities losses in the quarter compared to million of net gains last year expenses of million were down million yearonyear primarily driven by the absence of an impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year on the next page lets discuss the outlook our full year outlook for remains largely in line with our previous guidance we still expect nii to be approximately billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately billion but as youll see on the page weve lowered our outlook for the card net chargeoff rate to around as delinquencies remain very low so to wrap up were pleased with this quarters performance as we approach what we hope is the tail end of the pandemic the strengths of the company both in terms of our diversified business model as well as our fortress balance sheet talent and culture have enabled us to perform well through this difficult period while continuing to serve our clients customers and communities jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 as we look ahead and the environment normalizes new challenges will undoubtedly arise but we feel confident with the position of the company and the strategy going forward with that operator please open the line to qa question and answer section operator and our first question is coming from john mcdonald from autonomous research john please proceed john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning jeremy wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year it seems to imply a nice step up in nii for the fourth quarter to roughly billion was wondering what do you expect to be the drivers of that sequential step up and would you see the fourth quarter nii as a good starting point for us to think about our nii forecast jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah john good question and good calc there its true that is quite a bit of sequential growth if you do the math it suggests about million and in reality if you think about what weve been saying about the outlook for increased revolve and deployment and so on the increase is nonintuitively high and so just to explain within that there are a couple factors so one theres actually a meaningful amount of markets nii growth between the third and the fourth quarter which in general we sort of encourage you to ignore and theres also some sequential increase in nii from ppp forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number so if you strip those two out you still see a little bit of modest growth which is a little bit more consistent i think with the overall story that weve been telling which is that the real acceleration in nii especially from higher card revolve is a item in that context then if you take that sort of lower number and think about annualizing that i think its fair to assume that that would be a sort of lower end estimate for the number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of especially card revolve but obviously well give you a little bit more color about on next quarter john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and as a follow up your cash balances continue to grow and youve been conservative on liquidity deployment could you update us on your thinking around liquidity deployment pacing that and what factors youre balancing jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 yeah totally so at the highest level i would say that nothing has really changed meaning were still all else equal happy to be patient we still believe in a robust global recovery we still are a little bit concerned about inflation i think relative to the consensus and all of that contributes to a willingness to be relatively patient about deployment but its also fair to say that relative to last quarter rates are obviously higher we start to see central banks around the world normalizing their policy stance a little bit so the market implied rates are coming a little bit more in line with our view and given that it wouldnt be surprising if we saw some more opportunities for front end deployment cash and cashlike activity as well as possibly some duration management john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you operator our next question is coming from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities please proceed operator our next question is coming from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities please proceed james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning just first on loan growth as you noted auto has been strong cards starting to show signs of life but it looks like outside of acquisition finance ci still seems a little weak and weve got ongoing supply chain issues so as we think about the big picture how are you seeing i guess loan demand trends playing out and what are you expecting as the next months progresses jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so lets go through loan growth because obviously thats one of the areas that everyones interested in so if we start with card which is obviously the one thats going to matter the most in terms of nii impact as you said we see some signs of life and we believe that recovery is strongly underway and it seems hopefully like delta is really fading so thats going to help if you just look forward just to the holiday season we would expect to see normal seasonality and normal growth there and the question really for card as weve talked about a lot is whether that growth in spend and in card outstandings translates into revolve but as i noted in the prepared remarks when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our card customers and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to revolve we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there so that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for card outstandings to grow with higher spend but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year its going to take time obviously but that is the core view in home lending broadly we expect that this quarters trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue and then in ci which you mentioned just a reminder right that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the ci customers were eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise but from a financial performance perspective thats more of an outcome rather than a goal but we do as i noted upfront see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates so thats kind of consistent with the theme that weve been seeing which is that the smaller you are and the less likely you are to have had to jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 have benefited from the wideopen capital markets the more likely you are to be borrowing we do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment so its going to be interesting to see how that plays out and then in cre we see quite a robust origination pipeline as weve sort of fully removed any pandemicrelated credit pullbacks and were leaning into that and we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward and then finally i would note that we do see some loan growth in markets actually and we generally discourage you from focusing too much on nii and loan growth within markets but it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that were taking advantage of in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thats all very helpful and maybe just a follow up on the expense side you and your peers have all seen higher expenses this year higher capital markets and incentive expense and increased investment spend but as we think about going into next year of capital markets activity normalizes as many expect can we start to see expense growth slow or are there other considerations to think about whether its investment spend or inflation pressures that we should think about jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so its a little bit of an alloftheabove story i would say so first of all were still in the middle of budgeting and its sort of a little early to be giving you expense guidance well do more of that next quarter but realistically expenses are going to be up next year now to your point about capital marketsrelated expenses its obviously true that we pay for performance and in light of the very strong performance over the last couple years in both banking and markets we have seen increased compensation expense on the way up and therefore as a function of the amount of normalization that you see in youre going to see that come down in line all else equal obviously i would point out that i think that the amount of growth in that number that weve seen through the pandemic is less than a lot of people would have expected actually and therefore on the way back down you would also potentially expect less participation not to mention just the timing dynamics associated with the treatment of stockbased compensation vesting so all of that aside at the same time we are still investing we still see significant opportunities we still see marketing opportunities in card and yeah labor inflation is a question you saw us raise wages in parts of the us at the entry level that just came into effect this september and as we look out we see a lot of churn and as jamie was saying its good stuff its normal its understandable in this environment but labor inflation is definitely a watch item for us so when you put all that stuff together as i say well update you more next quarter but thats sort of how we see the expense outlook for next year james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay great thats helpful thanks operator the next question is coming from mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is open please proceed jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi there were a couple events during the quarter that i wanted to ask about and specifically how has the tech strategy evolved one you made the announcement that youre changing the retail bank core system entirely to the public cloud and thats a big change and jamie i would love to hear your comments on that and then second your expansion in the uk with digital banking what metrics are you shooting for and third your recent fintech acquisitions to what degree are there synergies among the acquisitions in addition to jpmorgan thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay mike hang on im writing down your questions because i dont want to lose track okay so lets start with the cloud first so yeah you will have seen some press coverage around our partnership with thought machine at a high level theres actually nothing new here weve actually been committed to the cloud for a long time and by the way when i say cloud i think were talking about both private and public cloud our core strategy involves really leaning into both and being very nimble across both and i think thats very important for us as a regulated institution from a resiliency perspective but the reasons for and thats all part of our overall tech modernization roadmap and a lot of the investments that were doing that youve heard all the leadership of the company talk about when it comes to thought machine in the consumer space there are five main reasons why we did that and its all the normal reasons why you do cloud stuff and you do tech modernization we want to be able to innovate quickly and bring products to consumers faster we want to be able to run multiple products on the same platform as i mentioned resiliency is critical increasingly we want to be able to run the bank much more in real time rather than based on batch processes and obviously apis are central to the entire strategy in this environment so thats what i would say about that now jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i just indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah please jamie jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thought machine is basically the core general ledger its not all the other stuff around consumer and when you do these conversions different than conversions of the past you can do them you can schedule pieces do part at a time not all at once like a big bang which we used to have to do when we did big mergers and stuff like that so i just put it at lower risk for the company but the core strategy hasnt changed at all jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay and then mike international consumer and acquisitions i think you asked about so in terms of international consumer you will have seen that we launched its obviously early days to give meaningful updates on that but you will have noted actually that weve just rebranded nutmeg as a jpmorgan company just a couple days ago so all of thats proceeding at pace and it seems to be pretty well received i think the offering is seen as differentiated and innovative so well have more to say about that over time generally jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just again ph just to add to that this is a 10year game plan this is not that were going to worry that much about metrics in the next month or two and this is a longterm work to try to get this thing right because if were ever going to be retail overseas its going to be digital and so were going to be very patient and at one point mike we will report some metrics here so you can see them but theyre not going to be material to the firms numbers for years jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its going to take time for sure so but just more generally in terms of the acquisition strategy weve talked about this a little bit before were not claiming that we have some overarching topdown acquisition strategy i think broadly were just doing things that make sense but there are some themes that you can detect around bolt on and adding capabilities just for the sake of argument if you start with awm you see a pretty consistent theme in there of esgrelated capability additions youve mentioned already international expansion and the potential for growth and it will be a long game as jamie says and then yeah theres definitely a fintech narrative a little bit in terms of some of the stuff that weve done in the cib and then within consumer most recently the collection of things that weve done i think is unified by the theme of providing more integrated and holistic experiences to our customers weve always been really proud of the value proposition that we offer especially in the card product but we think we can take it up even another notch with some of the stuff that were doing around lounges and cxloyalty and stuff like that so i think i touched on everything there mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you certainly did and just a follow up i mean we see the results the marginal efficiency in the businesses where youre growing has improved and we just dont have the why so how much of that is techdriven versus other reasons i mean i guess you have metrics internally that we just dont have but your marginal efficiency is what or your unit costs are going down or any additional color as to the why the marginal efficiency is improving jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i mean i think reasonable people can differ on how you talk about this stuff especially in terms of what parts of the expense base you see as a little bit more fixed versus a little bit more floating i would have said that in reality marginal expense increases as a function of most types of marginal revenue are actually lower than a lot of people think so the sort of operating leverage that you see especially in the type of environment that weve jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 had with really big increases in revenue in the capital markets areas and the nir side is actually relatively consistent with what i would have expected but a little bit to your point mike what is also true is that were a big organization theres a scale play here we have a big fixed cost base and a lot of the modernization agenda is about making sure that that doesnt creep and that its as expensive as possible so that it can be as nimble as possible and that marginal efficiency over time is as good as possible but thats a long play there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co let me just add mike one of the things you think about one is people worried about the forecast for next year and stuff like that were playing the game for years here so were going and were not going to disclose certain things like margin by product or stuff like that because its competitive information but the long game we are competing with some very large talented global players were not even in banking today and we are going to compete in that so even some of these acquisitions are more around that than around just what i consider traditional banking and so and in my whole life just so you know weve been modernizing technology every year of every month of every quarter thats like a permanent state of affairs obviously now its to the cloud and stuff like that those things are critical to do to be competitive going forward that was true by the way years ago mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thanks operator next up we have a question from ken usdin from jefferies your line is open please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i wanted to ask if you can expand a little bit more upon card fees and card revenue rate we all certainly expected the marketing expenses to kind of go up inside that line and just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was captured in the third quarter and just what your general outlook is for the fee line and the underlying overall revenue rate thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks ken so youre right part of the drop in the revenue rate this quarter is a function of higher card marketing spend which you would have expected as a result of what we said last quarter in terms of the importance of getting our fair share of the growth in spending as we emerged from the pandemic and the fact that were out in the market with a lot of offers that are seeing good uptake and were seeing nice growth there so thats expected and i think that card marketing number will actually remain elevated and if anything tick up a little bit sequentially just based on how the amortization there works so you should expect to see that continue jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 but in addition this quarter we have just an adjustment to the rewards liability which is contributing to the drop this quarter as well so that is not something that we see continuing so that should come out of the run rate as we look forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc can you help us understand like what the magnitude of that is and what you think about overall card revenue rate going forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean as you know we dont really manage the card revenue rate so its not a number that im eager to guide to but i think if i remember correctly i think the rewards liability adjustment this quarter was of the order of something like million so well confirm that but i think thats right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks if i might just ask jamie you made a comment yesterday about the supply chain hopefully easing by next year around this time what are you just hearing from your partners around the world in terms of the log jams and the potential for that to open up from here jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah im not hearing much different than youre hearing im just i know that the over focus over time is so extraordinary sometimes in the press that people forget the big picture the economy is growing or what people are buying has changed which has also hurt supply chains a little bit theres not one company i know that is not working aggressively to fix their supply chain issues sales are still up credit card debit card spends still up consumers in great shape and capitalism works i doubt well be talking about supply chain stuff in a year i just think were focusing on it too much and its simply dampening a fairly good economy its not reversing a fairly good economy ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you operator next up we have a question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi yeah two questions one just following up on the card discussion that we just had regarding the fees and the million on the roughly million on the rewards adjustment i mean it still leaves us with a pretty big decline qonq and im just trying to think through that a little bit because i know marketing rewards et cetera is up but was there anything in particular that would have driven a onetimer that is unlikely to persist or not i realize that cash back is a little more expensive so maybe thats a piece of it and its a onetime move or is it more a function of hey were going to be ramping our offerings here and so you should expect that the forward look is a stepdown from what you had been seeing in jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so betsy in short its really the latter so the only thing that is onetimeish in nature for lack of a better term is the rewards liability adjustment and the rest of it really is marketing spend and we see that as a critical investment in this moment its a moment of high engagement with the product and were very committed to making those investments and so that is going to remain elevated and if anything tick up a little bit as we look forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then separately i think today is the last day of the vice chair of supervision randy quarles term as vice chair of sup and reg and so the question is how should we be thinking about how you are positioning for an environment where maybe these rules dont change right like the lcr the slr other things that we have been hoping might have some changes in them should we be anticipating that in order to help deliver the growth that youre looking for that we should anticipate more pref issuance going forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think obviously were a little disappointed that we havent seen some of the changes on the non risk sensitive size base constraints that wed expected but were still hopeful that that will come soon we know the staff is hard at work on the basel iii end game and thats complicated stuff and it may be the case that some of those things are connected and our strategy on pref issuance has been to try to balance giving ourselves the capacity that we want to deal with the slr constraint without overissuing and therefore being stuck with high cost prefs that arent callable for five years so thats part of the reason why were operating a little bit above our cet1 target right now and were just going to continue to be nimble in that respect betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks operator next up a question from glenn schorr from evercore isi your line is proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so in the spirit of your thought on not overly focusing on the near term i heard your comments on payment rates in card seasonality optimism about revolving card balances so is there an implicit comment within there about buy now pay later and the impact it may or may not have id love to get your perspective on ph kind of this old but i guess new payment option might have on the card industry overall thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks glenn so bnpl everyones talking about it it is funny how layaways back in the ecommerce checkout lane and obviously were looking at it everyones talking about it and its a moment for us as a company where even though for any given thing thats emerging you can easily convince yourself that its kind of not a threat were in a moment of taking all types of potential disruptions especially fintechytype disruptions jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 quite seriously and in the case of bnpl its obviously particularly high profile because of the growth that weve seen although its a relatively small portion of the overall market ill remind you that we have our own very compelling offerings that speak directly to the installment payment experience in the form of my chase loan and my chase plan which we get really good feedback on the customer experience there in terms of kind of postpurchase experience you can select eligible purchases on the app and then move that to installment plan if you want but yeah we acknowledge that it is downstream of the point of sale which potentially raises some questions about whether we should be looking at moving a little bit more upstream there but even more generally when you take a step back what were really trying to do in the consumer business here is think about what is the actual customer need that is driving the growth in bnpl and how can we respond to it in a strategic holistic way across all of our customers and not sort of too narrowly and too reactively just respond to bnpl but its obviously a thing that were looking at and its quite interesting jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and this other example of fintech company glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah appreciate that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co you saw a firm come out and its no longer just about bnpl theyre going to have a debit card and a cash banking account so these are all different forms of competition which we have to respond to and so thats why when we talk about like expenses we will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate all that maybe one other comment or to get your thought on the right perspective to think about china and evergrande and what people care about most is is there an expansion across border meaning is this contained within their market is the funders that will have some marks within their market or do you see any domino effect in crossing borders thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so look obviously everyone is looking at evergrande let me just start by saying that for us in terms of direct evergrande exposure is absolutely de minimis so thats one piece as you would expect weve also looked at sort of more indirect exposures in terms of the broad general properties sector as well as exposures of financial institutions that we deal with to the china property sector and in general those exposures were all very modest so were obviously watching it closely and continuing to look for read across and do what you would expect us to do but were not terribly concerned right now about the impact on us jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 i think in terms of crossborder contagion i dont hold my own opinion on this in particularly high regard but it does seem like this was pretty well telegraphed by the chinese authorities when they talked about their three red lines so its a process thats being managed and i would say that the better view right now is that it will be contained but of course its the market so well see what happens glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks for all that jeremy thanks operator next up we have a question from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess just wanted to follow up on two themes that were discussed one around fintechs and the regulatory changes a lot of focus on the change in leadership at the regulatory agencies jamie youve talked about in the past in terms of the regulatory arbitrage when you look at big tech nonbank players i think bnpl is a good example of that do you think as we have new leadership at the regulatory agencies they are alert to this arbitrage and do you think we see a clamp down or is it too late for really them to create a framework that would level the playing field jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i dont expect that there will be beneficial changes that help banks but i think that we just have to compete with the hand were dealt and not expect anything like that and i think that youre going to have some people clamp down more on banks and maybe some people regulate fintech based on products or service something like that but im not expecting any relief ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it yeah and i was just wondering if therell be increased scrutiny of the nonbank players relative to the banks but point noted and i guess just on a separate question jeremy we didnt see any build in the cet1 when i look at the numerator anything going on there this quarter that impacted it and with the stock rate is at times tangible book just remind us how important are buybacks here as opposed to just keeping some dry powder as the economy gets better jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i mean the answer to how important buybacks are is that theyre at the end of our capital hierarchy as we often say right so organic growth including acquisitions sustainable dividend and only then do we look at buybacks and in light of the scb environment that were in where we dont have a fedapproved buyback plan anymore and if we just simply have to comply with the minimums in bau that gives us quite a bit of nimbleness which is an important thing to preserve in light of a world where we do hope for loan growth next year and where acquisitions are still potentially on the horizon so nothing really going on this quarter other than the little bit of rwa growth in the denominator and were just really going to stay nimble there jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc but is there a case to be made jeremy in terms of just holding some dry powder in excess capital given your macro outlook as opposed to buying back stock at current valuations jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think the valuations as the stock goes up you should expect us maybe one day buy less and we dont need dry powder we have an extraordinary amount of capital liquidity i mean extraordinary and we earned billion pretax a year i mean how much dry powder do you need we have trillion of cash and marketable securities we have well over billion of equity we can issue preferreds we can issue debt we can issue stock if we had to something so i dont think we need dry powder i think our capital cup runneth over where it is ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thank you operator the next one is from steve chubak from wolfe research please proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good morning so jeremy you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category just looking ahead is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with gdp or economic growth or is there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration in lending activity whether its just greater pentup loan demand normalization of the card payment rates or something else jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co good question steve but i think youre sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for which i am not really in a position to do but let me see if i can answer this at a high level i mean weve talked a lot about spend which we believe in driving card loans higher so thats one piece and the revolve story within that as a function of the spend down in cash buffers especially in our revolver the revolving segment of our customers and obviously as you know well if you kind of think about our nii as the sum product of the nim and the outstandings and the various loan categories it is really disproportionately card that drives things in the meantime if you move a little bit away from consumer to the larger wholesale system in a world where even if tapering starts relatively soon if that plays out over roughly eight months at billion of decrease a month you still if you do the math wind up with another trillion of qe so we are dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity and so in that context realistically its hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth at a minimum but frankly thats not really a big driver of performance for us so i dont know if that helps but its a good question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 thanks jeremy it absolutely helps and just one clarifying question on the ficc commentary you noted this quarters result included an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives portfolio i was hoping you could help unpack what that adjustment actually entails what prompted it and could you help size the impact in the quarter jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i could help unpack it but it would take another minutes which we dont really have its just bogstandard liquidity valuation type stuff in the derivatives book in terms of as we revise our assumptions about what the potential transaction cost would be associated with transferring certain types of positions its normal course stuff that just happened to be a little bit bigger i think fixed income was down and i think without that it would have been down so if that helps steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thanks for taking my questions operator next question is from matthew oconnor from deutsche bank please proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity and i guess just to kind of lean in a little bit if we look at the growth in deposits i know some of them are kind of considered noncore but take out the loan growth and the growth in securities book since covid youve got about an extra billion of deposits and how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities and understanding that you expect loan growth to pick up so that will go to some but is there a way to size that billion capacity in terms of buying securities jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think theres a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is in any given moment obviously as you said loan growth but also we always make these decisions on the longterm economic basis not for the purpose of generating shortterm nii and so when you do that you have to think about capital volatility drawdowns and frankly whether or not you see value and that if anything is probably the biggest single factor right now as i talked about earlier it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views at least from a rate perspective and that may lead to a little bit more deployment all else equal right now but when you start talking about spread product for example in light of the liquidity environment that were in the qe numbers that i mentioned a second ago that remains very very compressed and theres just not a lot of value there so were always we always try to be longterm economically motivated there considering all the scenarios considering risk management considering the convexity of the balance sheet and looking at value and being tactical there so thats really how i would think about that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 yeah i mean understood on a nearterm basis but i think a lot of investors are sitting here saying if the 10year or really any part of the curve hits that magic point for you what is just the capacity so for example if the year gets to say and youre confident its not going to go to do you have billion of capacity is it billion just any way to frame it longer term appreciating that its not what youre looking to do at this moment at these levels jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no i got the question and jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we can easily do billion jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i got the question i got why you want to know i guess i just feel think like for a company of our sophistication and given how carefully we think about this stuff the idea of a particular target at which we would deploy a particular amount of course jamie is right but its always going to be situational its always going to be a function of why the rate is where it is i mean in your question you alluded to its like if the 10year note is at and were sure its not going to but then wheres the rest of the yield curve what are the other options whats going on in that moment so its theres were always going to be situational and tactical about it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful and then can i just squeeze in youve announced a bunch of kind of what most of us would characterize as relatively small acquisitions some this quarter and obviously looking back for the full year is there something is there a way you can kind of size the capital impact of that i know most of the terms werent disclosed individually but any way to frame kind of the capital and financial impact and then just lastly remind us like what is the driving force when you look for a deal because some of the deals you kind of look at and youre like how does that fit into broader jpmorgan chase thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the capital impact in total isnt that bigger deal and were not going to disclose any more nor the immediate financial impact and each one is different so in consumer jeremy already said its more about lifestyle travel lounges millennial stuff like that in asset management products it was tax efficient products esg products jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 timber products stuff like that and then between nutmeg and c6 and stuff like that that is the longerterm view of us trying to get position into retail overseas over years if we can matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thank you operator next one is coming from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jeremy you were saying that when we were talking earlier about the potential slr changes and such and we havent seen anything and quarles is leaving today but you mentioned about maybe the fed is focused on the basel iii end game thats coming very soon here can you share with us from your guys perspective what are you focusing in on with the basel iii final rules and regulations that could affect your growth going forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think i mean the thing about the basel iii end game is that you need to essentially deal simultaneously with the basel floors the basel standardized floors and the collins floor so you need to simultaneously so from the perspective of the staff thats working on this stuff they have a tough challenge to simultaneously put in place a us rule which is baselcompliant while also complying with the collins floor standardized rwa minimum so thats complicated and its hard and its quite technical and it sort of explains why its taking a little bit longer than we might have otherwise thought in terms of the impact of that on our longterm growth i mean at a high level its unlikely to be significant i think that the related point is whether or not there are some changes as part of that or contemporaneously with that to these sort of nonrisk sensitive sizebased constraints like gsib and slr where obviously most prominently in the case of gsib its really getting pretty extreme in terms of the growth in the score for reasons that really have nothing to do with what the original design of the metric was and to a very significant degree are driven by the expansion of the system that weve seen in the last months so thats why we believe that that should be addressed as was contemplated in the original rule and so across all of those potential changes you could see us doing a little bit of optimization in response to those you can imagine that basel iii end game in terms of standardized and advanced and the impact on different products might make some things a little bit more capital efficient and others a little bit less capital efficient at the margin but were a big diversified company and were pretty good at navigating this stuff so when we have clarity well make the necessary tweaks gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then obviously you and the industry have seen really good deposit growth on a year overyear basis i think your deposits were up allin you talked specifically about retail being the number one market share in retail deposits when the fed ends qe assuming it does sometime by the middle of next year and im not asking you guys to forecast what your deposits are going to be but just higher level should we anticipate that deposits could actually decline or no that they are going to be so sticky even with the liquidity that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 everybody carries that we shouldnt really see a decline in deposits after qe ends lets call it second half of next year jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think theres a couple of factors in here so lets for the sake of argument set rrp aside for a second and hold that constant if you just look at the impact of qe on systemwide deposits we talk about tapering but as i said earlier tapering still involves another trillion of system expansion between now and the end of tapering or rather between the start of tapering and the end of tapering if the fed follows the same type of trajectory that it followed last time there would be an extended pause between the end of qe and the beginning of qt and again setting rrp aside for a second it would only really be with the beginning of qt that you would expect the size of the system deposit base to start shrinking and i think the timing last time if i remember correctly was something like months between the end of qe and the beginning of qt now of course rrp could bounce around and there could be other factors but at a high level thats how were thinking about it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i would just add my two cents i think theyll have to go quicker than that and theyll have to reverse some of it so youre talking about weve still got to increase deposits for a year and then there would be a fairly large reduction over a two or threeyear period which we should be prepared for gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator next question is from charles peabody from portales partners please proceed charles william peabody q analyst portales partners llc yes good morning i wanted to sort of get a progress report on your new headquarter building specifically whats the projected movein date or has that been affected by the pandemic secondly are there costs noticeable costs running through expense structured for that buildout and does that tick up noticeably when you move in and then thirdly whats the plan for unloading the properties that youll be vacating and how has that been affected by the current real estate market thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so the plan is on schedule movein date i think there are no material expense of course theres duplicate expenses and we have to sell the building and stuff like that but theres nothing material to our shareholders that we need to disclose operator any other questions jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 operator our next question yes sir that is coming from andrew lim from société générale please proceed andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my question so you talked jamie about how youre focusing on inflation just wondering if you could outline what youre looking at exactly metricwise across your businesses to signal to you that inflation is actually materializing as a concern and how would that pan out versus your expectations and in terms of ph like how we deal with this if it does materialize as a concern is there anything that you can do to try and protect the bank against inflationary forces there jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah well i mean i think we should look at the big picture here which i think is always important i mean two years ago we were facing covid virtually a great depression global pandemic and thats all in the back mirror which is good so by hopefully a year from now be no supply chain problem the pandemic will become endemic and i think its very good to have good healthy growth which we have and i think it would be good to have unemployment at its good that there are jobs that are open i think its good that wage is going up along and i think theres too much focus on and none of this changes how we run the business which is we add clients all the time consumer card auto deposits real estate small business large companies and stuff like that which is really the underlying thing that drives jpmorgan its not whether they take your revolver from or so having said all that yeah and im not focused on inflation we simply are pointing out well first of all you have inflation its its been now for the better part of a couple of quarters and its in my view unlikely to be lower than that next quarter or the quarter after that and the only question is does it start to ease after that with supply chains and wages and more people looking for work or does it continue to go up and of course we prepare for probabilities and eventualities and one of those probabilities is that it might go higher than people think and that theyll have to tamp down i doubt thatll happen before late in the meantime i think its unbelievable that were getting out of this thing and we have unemployment and you can have good growth with some inflation and thats okay i think that people are always focusing too much on immediate concerns if you have inflation of or were still going to open deposit accounts and checking accounts and grow our business i also should point out because its just always in the back of my mind of our billion of revenues billion is subscription revenues asset management commercial banking consumer banking which is pretty good wholesale payments securities services custody and so were pretty proud with the people whove accomplished all this if you look at the actual underlying numbers were getting earnings per second more customers more accounts more share and at the end of the day that is what drives everything andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk okay thats great so it seems like youre taking a benign view that its manageable its not going to get out of hand which is fair enough jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2021 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no its the opposite im telling you i dont its the opposite im telling you i dont know were prepared for all eventualities there may be a fat tail of inflation and one of the things about our balance sheet you guys talk about liquidity and stuff like that one of the fat tails that a bank should be worried about is high inflation and high rates and being very liquid protects us more against that than other things andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk right got it thanks for the clarity on that and just a short followon question jeremy could you update us on the amount of excess provisions youve got versus your basecase economic scenario youve given that number in the past and perhaps a bit of color and also on how that base case has changed over the quarter if it has indeed jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think the base case the central case has probably actually gotten a tiny bit worse quarteronquarter in light of the revisions in gdp outlook but as you know the framework also involves looking at probability weighted scenarios and as i said in the prepared remarks the sort of less extreme downside scenarios contributed a bit to the release this quarter in terms of sizing the overall balance again as i said in the prepared remarks they remain a little bit elevated relative to what they would be if we had this type of economic performance with none of the covidrelated unusual features ie uncertainty about the virus as much as we are optimistic about that right now or uncertainty about labor market conditions or the fact that even though a lot of the essentially all the federal level unemployment assistance has now rolled off and most of the states have too theres still some forms of assistance the mortgage foreclosure moratorium student loan stuff rent moratorium stuff like that that dont roll off until later in the year so theres a number of factors in the environment that are still unusual which do contribute to slightly elevated reserves relative to what we would otherwise have and as things play out those will develop jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jeremy just really quickly ive got to go because im out of town i have meetings i have to go to but you guys should continue and folks thanks for listening to us well talk to you all soon jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co all right thanks jamie operator and by that we have no further questions waiting jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay thanks very much jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3
