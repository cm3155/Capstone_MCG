relationships with existing clients finally strong yearoveryear markets loan growth was primarily driven by residential and commercial real estate warehouse lending and loans included in corpother

total deposits increased from the prioryear period in our consumer business deposits increased driven by continued growth in north america and asia in north america deposit growth accelerated to with contribution from both traditional and digital channels in our institutional business deposits grew primarily driven by highquality deposit growth in tts now let me highlight our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide in we issued approximately billion of parentlevel benchmark debt across a variety of tenors currencies and structures last week we issued just over billion going forward we will continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors currencies and structures on slide let me cover our bank note issuance program in we issued just under billion of bank notes and going forward we will continue to maintain the flexibility to issue across a variety of tenors currencies and structures as we drive the efficiency of our funding sources on slide let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectations as i mentioned during we issued billion of parent benchmark debt with billion of maturities at the bank level we issued billion of bank notes with billion of maturities across both bank notes and credit card securitizations looking to we expect gross issuance in and around billion in aggregate across our parent benchmark and our bank level programs including the roughly billion we issued last week and we will maintain the flexibility to optimize our funding through opportunistic redemptions on slide we show the composition of our longterm debt outstanding during the fourth quarter our total long term debt increased by approximately billion to billion driven by issuance out of our nonbank entities on slide we provide an update of our lcr metrics and drivers our average lcr increased modestly to this quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 turning to slide let me summarize our key regulatory

capital ratio of and an slr of an average lcr of and an estimated nsfr of greater than and we maintained a surplus above our tlac requirement finally we continue to further diversify and optimize our liquidity resources before we move on to qa let me touch briefly on the transition away from libor broadlyspeaking we are continuing to prepare ourselves by working with our regulators and industry working groups such as the alternative reference rate committee as ive mentioned previously we have several work streams which are focused on the transition related to a number of areas including the impact on our clients operational capabilities and legal and financial contracts we are scoping our contracts for the repapering efforts that will be required to both transition to new rates and ensure that fallback language is robust we are encouraging adoption of industry led protocols and solutions in order to ensure consistency where appropriate we are making markets and new riskfree rates as well as supporting the transition of legacy derivatives portfolios and lastly weve issued benchmark bonds referencing sofr from both the bank and the parent as well as preferred securities which will reference sofr once the fixed interest rate period ends with regard to the unique language in the subset of our preferred securities we are continuing to evaluate alternatives including a potential exchange or amendment as we mentioned last quarter we continue to get more clarity on the various implications of a potential transaction including industry feedback received from the sec in the fourth quarter and while we are not yet in a position to speak to a specific transaction or timing we are continuing to make progress working through the alternatives and well continue to provide you with updates and with that mark and i will be happy to answer your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of hima inguva of bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you very much for taking my question and happy new year to mark mike and tom always helpful that you do these calls and i hope that other banks definitely follow the trend mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc thank you hima hima b inguva q analyst bank of america merrill lynch so im going to start off with actually the i apologize if i couldnt find this but the breakdown between parent benchmark debt and the bank level debt if youre willing to provide that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah so hima over the last couple of years if you look at what weve issued go back to we issued billion and that was broken down evenly between the bank and the parent last year we issued billion and we issued less in the bank than we had done in the previous year and the benchmark was roughly the same this year we are indicating in and around billion and at this point its hard to know exactly how that split will break down it really will be a function of how our balance sheet evolves and grows and what our client needs are but if you look at the last two years it gives you some sense of how those levels between those two programs can vary operator our next question comes from line of scott cavanagh of apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc good morning guys mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning scott citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc indiscernible as always so on the issuance specifically just looking at the maturities versus the issuance expectations on slide what is the incremental issuance at the parent was that just balance sheet growth or how should we be thinking about that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah scott its mike i would say that theres a number of things that is always going to impact how we think about that issuance activity it is going to be a function of how the balance sheet grows and how our clients engage us obviously we think about tlac as well and were running a goodsized buffer right now but over the course of the year that will decay and then of course well be thinking about market conditions and market conditions right now are favorable so well be looking at a number of factors and that will really drive how we issue over the course of the year operator our next question comes from the line of arnold kakuda of bloomberg arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research hi guys once again thanks a lot for the call really helpful so this question might be a little hard to answer but and ill give it a shot anyway so concerns about the coronavirus are growing and as a global banking institution with about to of your loans based out of asia you might have a unique perspective on currently what are you seeing now and maybe if you can give some context of what did you see maybe years ago with sars mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi its mark how are you arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research good hows it going mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good as you described that is a tough question to answer i guess id address it in this way our primary concern as you would imagine right now is for the health and wellbeing of those impacted and we dont have any presence in wuhan that said we do have operations in china and across the region we have a continuity of business plan thats in place today were obviously focused on the safety of our employees and have taken a number of actions regarding restricting travel in order to ensure the safety of all employees its a fluid situation that we continue to monitor closely and will continue to do so over the coming period of time with regard to the coronavirus thats really all that we can say at this point its a situation that were taking very seriously and were very focused on health and wellbeing citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 operator our next question comes from the line of scott frost of state street global scott frost q analyst state street global advisors hi thanks for taking the call the question i think you touched on this the ficcrelated results in last quarter that seems to be more calendarrelated we shouldnt look at that as a sustainable level i think thats correct but correct me if im wrong on that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so we did in the fourth quarter we saw very good ficc performance on the heels of a prior year as you know at the end of where there was serious pressure from an industry point of view on activity in markets broadly and so that strong performance is a byproduct of we think very strong continued engagement with our clients but on a tough comparison from the or a very poor comparison in terms of the prior years performance we do feel good about the engagement were seeing with clients across the fixed income franchise and we do expect to see continued strong engagement as we grow there and take share there but the performance is a byproduct of that rebound in part operator our next question comes from the line of robert smalley of ubs robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and thanks for doing the call again michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure good morning robert robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thanks a couple things on asset quality and one on preferreds quickly could you give us an update on flex loan and flex pay how have they been performing so far getting what you want out of that also in the equity call on asset quality you spoke about episodic downgrades when do these become a pattern are you starting to see any patterns there and then finally on preferreds you have a few issues that are callable near the end of the year given the low rate environment the success you had with the recent issue have you thought about bringing a call or anything like that forward on those thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so why dont i take the first two and then mike you can touch on the last one so with regard to flex loan so i guess id start by saying we feel very good about the execution weve seen in our north america consumer strategy in particular were getting we think very good traction in growing our penetration of our branded card customers we think were getting very good traction in the way of demonstrating citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 our digital capabilities as weve seen our digital deposit sales grow on roughly billion in digital deposit sales we also feel good about applying those digital capabilities to how we expand our lending offering and so as you referenced in january we launched flex loan flex loan allows our customers to access funds by converting a portion of their existing credit line into a fixed interest payment personal loan the results continue to be positive loan originations continue to grow were maintaining a strong credit profile in april we launched flex pay that allows customers to select certain larger purchases or groups of certain purchases and pay for them over time and while its still early we also there see good initial results and again while maintaining a strong credit profile so we feel good about those two products but more broadly we feel good about the progress were making with our north america consumer strategy and the capabilities were demonstrating on the heels of having made investments in our digital capabilities with regard to the episodic downgrades on the corporate side that you referenced look when i look at the performance in our corporate lending portfolio and the cost of credit that we have for the full year there it is in line with what weve talked about in the way of a normalized level of cost of credit so its right inline with that we did see a couple of episodics in the fourth quarter but again that aggregate level is consistent with what we would have expected and when i look at loss rates there they are very very low and again inside of the range we would have expected we continue to have and focus on a highcredit quality customer so north of is in investment grade in the way of the client focus that we have and we arent seeing anything in particular that is of major concern we obviously continue to watch very carefully in light of where we are in the cycle but we arent seeing any systemic areas of concern as we continue to monitor activity and the portfolio we have mike you want to ph comment on michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah sure in terms of preferreds and i would say similar to how i think about the broader issuance were always going to be monitoring and evaluating market conditions and that will be a factor but then again of course well be actively looking at the balance sheet needs and the growth of that balance sheet and therefore what does that mean for our capital needs and right now were maybe running a bit high on at1 relative to where we could be running it but i would say that this is going to be an ongoing evaluation well be looking at both issuance from an opportunistic perspective but also looking at the needs over time and then certainly as it pertains to our call well always look at whether we do need the capital at that time and whether we wish to just call it away and if we do need the capital well look at the economics associated with leaving that particular preferred outstanding versus calling it and reissuing at the then current market levels operator our next question comes from line of mark kehoe mackay shields mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc hey good morning just two questions just first of all on the digital deposits gathering effort to an extent if you are more successful there can that help kind of credit some of the issuance at the bank level and is that strategy there more focused on providing services rather than just kind of rate paid and being a ratehigh payer citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 and then my second question was with the issuance of the 20year by the treasury later this year could that kind of change some of the ph tenures that you would focus on ph in terms of at the holding company level thank you michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc thank you mark in terms of our bank issuance program again as i said earlier were going to be looking at a variety of factors that can impact the bank and well look at market conditions and well look at the needs of the balance sheet and if you look at over the past couple of years we did issue a bit less in the bank last year than we did in the previous year and some of that was influenced by i would say the good momentum that we saw in deposits and that was true in the retail bank but it was also true in our other businesses that weve mentioned before in terms of digital the focus really there is about engaging our consumer customers and thinking about that as a holistic engagement of that customer base and so what we want is a full offering of products for those customers and digital is just part of that strategy as we think about our deposit base we are raising deposits both from traditional channels in the six major markets that we operate in but utilizing digital capabilities allows us to grow deposits outside of that footprint it allows us to grow deposits with a broader customer base that we have in our consumer bank so it is not about rate its more about engaging our clients from a broader perspective operator our next question comes from the line of jesse rosenthal of creditsights jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc good morning jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc just a quick one for me guys on libor and definitely i echo everyones appreciation for these periodic updates but you mentioned the sec response to the arrc letter that came in december and i think it was the last call last quarter you talked about the irs and treasury guidance that came out im just wondering what other sorts of sort of dominos may be out there that we should be looking for as the industry progresses and as you kind of contemplate dealing with the legacy securities via amendment or exchange michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 sure its mike and look theres been a number of factors that have come out and were actively evaluating all of those its hard to know what else may come through but i would say what were broadly looking at is understanding the implications of our alternatives that ive talked about an amendment or an exchange and some of those alternatives could be the impact of whether that transaction can be deemed extinguishment or whether thats just a modification so that was a key and then also the adoption of i would say a lot of the legacy language in the protocol those are all things more broadly that the industry is still working towards and i would say that continues to be an evolution from the preferreds perspective again all this information that continues to come in just ensures that we have a good line of sight in terms of how we evaluate our potential options and thats both for us and our investors so again we just want to make sure were taking a thorough evaluation of it and that we continue to operate in a way thats consistent with industry standards operator our next question comes from the line of jeff bernstein of insight investment jeff bernstein q analyst insight investment hi three short questions hong kong exposure would we expect in the rate of growth to decline or do you have a specific target as to what you might want to get to second thing the ph size change in the fico calculations what kind of impact you think that will have on you guys if at all or what kind of reaction you might have to it and lastly on the libor question a little different angle how would you handicap the possibility that it remains quoted after the current drop dead date mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc right so why dont i start on hong kong so look weve been in hong kong for over years weve monitored the situation there over the past number of months in terms of the underlying performance weve got our loans if you look at kind of the top country exposures that we put out in the third quarter our loans were roughly about billion or so our total exposure there was roughly about billion weve seen good growth in the way of our loan activity there in secured lending and more broadly we would expect to see notwithstanding the environment there we would expect to see continued client engagement over the course of and it continues to be an important market for us as we move forward inside of the asia region michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah and in terms of the libor question obviously were still a couple of years away its hard to know at this point what that handicap may look like i would say the industry clearly has been focused on the transition i would say a lot of whats been done todate has been planning for the broader efforts clearly as weve been doing weve been making markets in those riskfree rates weve been issuing off of that index as well such as sofr and so theres a good amount of transition that still needs to take place in terms of execution including building liquidity in these riskfree rates theres a lot of work to be done on contracts as well its just hard to know right now though what the probability of banks continuing to close beyond the end of i think the industrys focus has been and will continue to be on ensuring that by the end of that we are ready to transition away citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc in terms of your other question which was around the significance of the fico changes we operate in markets where fico is a factor and in markets where its a less of a factor in terms of how those markets have developed from a credit rating point of view fico as a result is one of many factors that we consider when we think about the lending activity that we do with customers but we tend to focus on the higherend customers whether they are corporate customers or consumer customers and how we assess their credit is a combination of things including fico operator our next question comes from the line of brian monteleone of barclays brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hey thanks good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc good morning brian brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hey so mike i know you talked about kind of the efforts that youre undergoing in terms of scoping out contracts that are in need of repapering can you talk a little bit just about like what youve learned in terms of like the size of that effort and then also just kind of do you have like a timeline in mind for kind of completing that work and then i know you referred to the kind of updated guidance from irs sic ifrs and from fasb do you have any kind of timeline in mind for when you expect those proposals to be finalized michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc so in terms of the repapering efforts again this is pretty broad in terms of how were thinking about that obviously its going to pertain more to i would say the corporate loan books and really that involves a lot of the centralizing of those contracts the digitizing of those contracts to enable a smoother transition and whether thats including amendments or being able to transition to those new rates so its going to take some time i dont have the exact timeline on it because those contracts which you may want to digitize but then of course you may have more bespoke contracts that well be a little more involved so its hard to know exactly what that timeline looks like but clearly as ive said before we are operating with the assumption that we transition away from libor by the end of so all of our efforts are aimed to get that work done in advance of that date and again in terms of the broader work going on again were taking that information were evaluating it in terms of what our alternatives may be and making sure that we understand the implications very clearly on us and our investors again with all these efforts very clear focus in terms of the timeline that we need to be operating citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 under we know what that transition entails at least in terms of timing so that just remains a key factor for us is that ultimate transition away from libor mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc its a firmwide effort operator our next question comes from the line of david jiang of prudential david jiang q analyst pgim inc hi guys mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi david david jiang q analyst pgim inc i had a quick question on the issuance plan i noticed in and even in theres no securitization is there not a need for further securitizations out of the credit card trust michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc hi its mike i would say that when weve looked at the note program weve seen very good demand in that program and of course were evaluating the economics and other factors that impact the notes including fdic fees so i would say our lead has been with bank notes rather than securitization but obviously that program is something that we still could utilize over the course of the year its really just been a preference for bank notes based on the demand and the economics but well be evaluating all of our funding levers over the course of the year as we normally would operator our next question comes from the line of hima inguva of bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great thank you very much i just have a couple of more questions for me i would like to know your expectation around seb and how youre factoring that into your plans for prefs and sub debt so are you expecting seb to be finalized for ccar thats the first question and then your thinking around on how that factors into your overall plan that youve laid out for prefs ph as the less sub debt please mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so ill get that started so look i mean just based on the public statements that are out there we expect that we will get some version of the seb prior to the submission for the ccar cycle wed certainly welcome the greater clarity were obviously between now and then continuing to work on our ccar process and citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 as weve done in the past cycles well submit a robust and credible plan based on our bank holding company scenarios and with obviously consideration for the regulatory scenarios whenever they come in and whenever we get clarity on seb well incorporate that accordingly i guess what id point out is id point you back to some extent to our cet1 targeted level if you will targeted ratio of about were at now and when we think about that target that weve set weve factored in obviously the regulatory minimum at about or at another three percentage points for the gsib score that we carry and then as a proxy for the stress capital buffer we have another three percentage points and then obviously a management buffer of about basis points and so we factored in based on what we know today and based on output from prioryear scenarios but as we get more information well obviously move to factor that into our analysis in time for the submission notwithstanding not having received it yet michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah and hima its mike i think you were asking about the preferreds and all i would say is that were really not taking a different approach as weve talked about in the past as calls come due were going to evaluate the need for that capital you could see were running a little bit above our at1 target now but again well take a view on what our capital needs are going forward and whether its an opportunity or not to call that security operator our next question comes from the line of scott cavanagh from apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc thanks guys for putting me back in the queue so two questions on cecl we saw a number of your peers put out varying levels of disclosure on it how are you guys thinking about that going forward and then secondly for your private label portfolio how do we think about the rsa agreement and i know theyre all tailored but how should we be thinking about that the balancing of the provisioning and the varying levels of flexibility under those contracts mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc okay in terms of cecl i referenced on the earnings call that we expect the day impact to increase the reserves by about which is inline with the guidance that id given in the past that roughly equates to about billion when we look at that from a regulatory perspective its about six basis points on the cet capital in when you break down that billion given our consumer and our corporate businesses the lions share of it is out of the consumer business due to cards and thats roughly billion is due to cards and youre really changing the coverage and increasing that from to months theres a decrease on the corporate side of about million and thats due to more precise usage of tenors so rounding to the next quarter versus year as well as incorporating estimated recoveries and so the combination of those two get us to that roughly billion we factor that into how we thought about our go forward targets and are comfortable managing to that citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 as it relates to disclosure going forward thats going to obviously there are guidelines around the disclosure and the level of cecl impact will vary from quartertoquarter based on the balances that we have and how they grow through the course of the year and the mix whether they are on the card side branded cards versus retail services versus on the corporate side as well as the economic assumptions that are out there including the probability of recession and severity of recession and so there are a number of factors that will influence kind of the day impact and we obviously will work to ensure that we provide disclosure that is consistent with the guidelines that have been given and then in terms of the second part of your question the ncls generally impact the revenue sharing agreements and not the reserves operator our next question comes from the line of scott frost of state street global scott frost q analyst state street global advisors thanks for the follow just to touch on preferreds once again i just want to make sure im getting where your head is at on on preferred issuance i mean understand low rates tight spreads and especially what looks like with fiveyear ph through sofr very low back end is it fair to say that youre thinking of this particular advantage of new and potential preferreds as more permanent in nature or is that a reach and also i have a followup for your tlac issuance just to clarify michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah look with the preferreds i mean typically when youre issuing and you can see what we have outstanding they will have some call feature to them and so we embed that purposely in the structure and im sorry your second question scott frost q analyst state street global advisors well it was should we think of these as more permanent in nature or is that a reach michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc again i would say that weve looked at all of our structures yeah there is a call feature and when that call is eligible well evaluate the need for maintaining that or not scott frost a analyst state street global advisors okay okay and on tlac again scotts questions were about rationale for issuance but what i heard you say was growth and potential issuance at holdco could be related to balance sheet growth or for resolution purposes theres no specificity there should we also weave in rotce targets as a factor in how youre going to issue michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 well look i think when were issuing were again including a variety of factors and first when we think about our liability structure were focused on maintaining a good amount of liquidity we want to have the right amount of liquidity for the firm we want to have diversification of those liquidity resources when i think about the issuance program we want a broad investor base but that being said you heard me talk a lot about optimization of our funding sources and that optimization is about both liquidity management but also ensuring that were also being smart and economical about those sources of liquidity so we certainly do think about the economics and certainly manage the balance sheet in a way that is facilitating our client needs but also optimization with a focus on returns too and again when you look at how weve issued over the past couple of years by broadening out just from dollars to overseas currencies again theres a play there to broaden our investor base but also looking at the economics associated with issuing in foreign currency and swapping back to dollars so a number of factors will play in but returns is something of course that we are optimizing as well as we think about our funding scott frost q analyst state street global advisors i appreciate the comments thank you operator our next question comes from the line of doug greiner of wilbanks smith thomas douglas david greiner q analyst wilbanks smith thomas asset management llc hi can you just clarify on the legacy libor structure for the legacy preferreds would it be your preference to exchange or amend that on the capital trust securities and secondarily can you just review like historically the last couple years given where capital levels are the strategic rationale for maintaining these capital trust securities thank you michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah i think youre talking about the ph ends and as weve said before it doesnt make sense at this time and i think some time ago we said well never say never but at this time thats just not something that we are looking to pursue operator and ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question our final question will come from the line of mark kehoe of mackay shields mark kehoe q analyst mackay shields llc hey good morning again just in terms of the treasurys plan to issue a 20year bond is that an area that you would like to issue at and also if you were to issue a 20year would that mean that you would reduce issuance of the 10year or reduce issuance at the 30year part of the curve or ph is it really a function of whats on the other side of the balance sheet thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 28jan2020 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yes thanks mark thanks for that question again and when we look at issuance as weve done in previous years were going to look at a variety of tenors ideally were not issuing in just a few different tenors but are issuing across the curve thats going to be informed by a desire to keep a good amount of diversification across the tenors and not have it concentrated in one area and again its going to be a function of where that investor demand is and you saw us start off the year with an noncall that 10year part of the curve has traded quite well theres been good demand there so thats where we started the year in terms of that is again a tenor point that we will evaluate but again well be looking at how good of a demand we have for that tenor point but its hard to know what we would do i think your question also was if we did some would that take away from again i think were going to try to issue across a variety of tenors but its hard to know exactly right now what how far out we will go and then what impact that may have on other tenors operator and that does conclude the questionandanswer session for today mr rogers do you have any closing remarks thomas rogers headfixed income investor relations citigroup inc i just wanted to thank everyone for joining the call today and of course if you have any followup questions please feel free to reach out to us at investor relations thank you operator
