very much welcome everybody to our first quarter earnings call here with me are tim crane our president and ceo in waiting david dykstra our vice chair and chief operating officer rich murphy our vice chair and chief lending officer kate boege our general counsel whos outside by the way indiscernible but try kate im not going to say anything bad and dave stoehr our cfo so on a different approach this quarter some general comments from me tim will discuss operating results in detail dave dykstra will discuss other income and expense in detail murphy will discuss credit in detail tim crane will talk about his thoughts about the future and back to me for some final thoughts and time for questions general comments well weve had record results i chose the right time to semiretire but given the industry challenges arose during the quarter just like lloyd bridges in the movie airplane i picked the wrong quarter to quit sniffing glue despite the turmoil in the banking industry we had recorded record net income and ppp earnings the challenges we faced that face the industry our consistent conservative approach to banking also thrived during the times and as you heard me say the concentration skill weve always been old school and hollywood actors and no thats not changing i believe the current challenges in the industry open a lot of doors for us just like in the past industry meltdowns for example great recession our open door strategy result in record earnings while being one of the most acquisitive companies in the country pandemic general results indiscernible pandemic ppp loans were a real plus for us theres only spillover into a ton of new clients i think back to the russian ruble thing and i always love it smelling great because of our approach and i expect we would continue to do the same now ill turn over to tim to talk about our results timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp great thanks ed obviously lots to talk about in terms of both the balance sheet and the recent industry developments its important to note that many of my comments as well as rich and daves to come are supported by slides that weve included in our earnings presentation that may be helpful first with respect to deposits deposits for the quarter were down or million essentially flat in a period where we often see some seasonal outflows while we spent a great deal of time communicating with our clients in the days after march 10th and saw a significant shift in our deposit mix which ill discuss in a moment our overall level of deposits remained very stable in terms of additional detail consumer deposits were actually up for the quarter and the offset was primarily in our cdec group deposits related to our real estate related exchange business and were down in our wealth management area where we continue to see some movement to treasuries and the money market funds presumably for both rate and insurance reasons except for municipal deposits which are in almost all cases insured or collateralized we do not have any significant deposit concentrations our average deposit account size is under we dont have any exposure to crypto deposit activity in addition both our federal home loan bank and total overall nondeposit borrowings were unchanged in the quarter we didnt borrow from the fed discount window and have no intent to use the bank term funding facility during the quarter again we saw movement from noninterest bearing deposits to both our unique wintrust maxsafe product which provides customers up to million in insurance for account holder and other wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 reciprocal insured products maxsafe deposits increased by about billion during the quarter with another several hundred million dollars primarily larger deposits moving to other reciprocal insured products noninterestbearing deposits at the end of the quarter represented of total deposits a return to near pre pandemic levels consistent with a more normal rate environment these movements do not appear to be unique to us but they obviously increase the cost of deposits for the quarter interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points our interestbearing deposit beta through the first quarter was we expect the activities postmarch 10th will result in an interestbearing deposit beta over the full cycle in excess of the that we had previously projected currently were assuming a full cycle number of approximately at quarter end fully insured or collateralized deposits totaled about of total deposits a number that continues to trend higher loan growth for the quarter was about million on the low end of our range rich will talk about loan growth loan composition and continued strong credit performance in just a few minutes with respect to the net interest margin it was up basis points to were pleased with this result in light of the late quarter pressure on deposit costs and the negative impact of our hedging activities while we expect deposit cost increases and incremental mix change may continue we believe given the current rate environment and the continued benefit associated with the favorable repricing of our premium finance loans as a reminder those were about a third of our loan book that well maintain a margin of approximately for the next several quarters given the assumptions around our balance sheet we remain slightly assetsensitive an additional 25basispoint increase in rates if that were to occur with all else equal provide approximately million in benefit in terms of net interest income on an annualized basis the strong earnings for the quarter produced a material increase in our capital ratios total riskbased capital increased to cet1 to both we believe are appropriate on a riskadjusted basis and should continue to expand tangible book value in the quarter increased materially to per share just a quick note on securities and capital the combined unrealized pretax securities losses both available for sale and held to maturity at the end of the quarter totaled approximately billion if a regulatory rule change occurred and we were forced to mark our entire securities portfolio the bank would remain wellcapitalized so despite the external volatility in the latter part of march and the prospect for evolving deposit related behavior change we continue to see very good pipelines and opportunities in the market and typical client activities dave david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim ill cover some of the noteworthy income statement categories starting with net interest income for the first quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million as compared to the first quarter of the million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the improvement in the net interest margin that tim talked about partially offset by the impact of having two fewer days in the quarter the impact of having two fewer days relative to the fourth quarter was approximately million so in other words one day is worth about million of net interest income to us the net interest margin improved basis points from the prior quarter to a beneficial increase of basis points on the yield on earning assets and a 17basispoint increase in the net free funds contribution combined with the basis point increase for the rate paid on the liabilities resulted in the improved margin the increase in wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 the yield on the earning assets as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a 67basispoint improvement in loan yields and a higher liquidity management asset yield as the company earned higher short term yields on the interestbearing deposits held at banks and its investment securities the increase in the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter was driven by a 67basispoint increase in the rate paid on the interestbearing deposits its interesting to note that both the loan yield increase and the deposit costs increase were both basis points changes during the quarter we continue to believe that our relatively shortterm and assetsensitive balance sheet structure can provide for margin stability as our premium finance portfolios which comprise roughly a third of our loan portfolio should continue to reprice upwards over the course of this year which should substantially mitigate the rise in deposit pricing also as we discussed on prior calls the company has been entered into an interest rate derivative transaction specifically swap and collar contracts to protect the net interest margin in a falling rate environment our earnings presentation deck has the details of those derivative positions including terms and rates for your information the impact of those derivative transactions during the quarter was to limit the net interest margin expansion by basis points in other words the net interest margin would have expanded by basis points during the quarter rather than basis points if we had not entered into those contracts we believe it is prudent in the current environment to sacrifice some current margin expansion to mitigate a downside risk if interest rates were to decline materially in the future turning to provision for credit losses wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter compared to a provision of million on the prior quarter and a million provision expense recorded in the yearago quarter the lower provision expense in the first quarter relative to the prior quarter was primarily a result of less loan growth during the quarter and changes to the macroeconomic outlook related to projected credit spreads and commercial real estate price index data now rich murphy will talk about credit in just a bit but i should note that the current quarter net chargeoffs and the mix of classified loans remained relatively stable and very good and did not have a significant impact on the level of the first quarters provision for credit losses turning to the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections total noninterest income totaled million in the first quarter and was up nearly million when compared to the priorquarter total of million the primary reasons for the increase were due to an million improvement in the gains and losses related to the companys securities portfolio the company recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of compared to a loss of million recorded in the fourth quarter of the quarterly fluctuation was primarily related to changes in equity valuations that affect a portion of our securities portfolio and not from sales of securities a million increase in fees on covered call options in the first quarter of relative to the prior quarter also contributed to the increase and a million increase in mortgage banking revenue as production margins improved which more than offset a slight decline in the volume of loans originated during the first quarter of the year we saw mortgage application volume increase slightly during each month of the first quarter and are seeing continued increases in loan application volume early in the second quarter albeit still relatively small increases wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 but this should provide support to the mortgage banking revenue in the second quarter additionally for your information roughly of the application volume is related to purchased home activity on the noninterest expense categories noninterest expenses totaled million in the first quarter and were down approximately million when compared to the priorquarter total of million the primary reasons for the decrease were due to salaries and employee benefit expenses decreasing by approximately million in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year relative to the prior quarter the current quarter decline is primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation of approximately million largely related to lower incentive compensation accruals the category also saw approximately million of lower employee benefits expense due to fewer health insurance claims during the quarter these declines were partially offset by approximately million of increased salary expense primarily due to the impact of annual merit increases that took effect in the first quarter our advertising and marketing expenses decreased by million in the first quarter of when compared to the prior quarter as we have discussed in previous calls this category of expenses tends to be lower in the fourth and the first quarters of the year advertising and marketing expenses are expected to increase in the second quarter due to our marketing and sponsorship expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships other summertime sponsorship events held in the communities that we serve and marketing of our branded deposit products lending expenses also declined approximately million due to lower overall loan origination activity experienced in the first quarter offsetting these expense declines noted was a million increase in fdic insurance expense which was primarily related to the 2basispoint increase in the assessed premiums that the fdic began imposing on financial institutions in other than those expense categories that i just discussed all other expense categories in the aggregate were down by approximately million compared to the fourth quarter of our efficiency ratio declined to for the first quarter from in the fourth quarter of as expenses did not increase at a rate commensurate with the increase in revenues and our net overhead ratio was in the first quarter and lower than the in the prior quarter due to slightly higher fee income and wellcontrolled expenses looking forward we expect fee income and noninterest expenses to increase somewhat as a result of the wealth management acquisition which was completed at the beginning of april we would also expect mortgage revenues and related expenses to increase slightly as springtime hastens the home buying season additionally as i noted earlier the seasonal increase in marketing sponsorships will add to that expense category so we anticipate slightly higher wealth management mortgage revenues and slightly higher expenses in the future quarters but depending on the mortgage volumes and balance sheet growth we would still expect to maintain a net overhead ratio in the to range that we have generally experienced the last two quarters so with that ill conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the first quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter was million or annualized loan growth was largely concentrated in two portfolios commercial real estate which grew by million which wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 was primarily draws on existing loans and residential real estate which was up million this rate of loan growth is slower than what we have seen for some time and below our guidance of mid to highsingle digits we believe this slower growth is attributable to several factors the first quarter is generally the slowest quarter for core loan production and is a seasonally slow quarter for the commercial premium finance portfolio higher borrowing costs have forced borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects business expansion equipment purchases and premium finance costs and overall business sentiment which has dropped during the past few months however we continue to see solid momentum in our core ci and cre pipelines disruptions in the banking landscape continue to work to our benefit as we have seen numerous quality opportunities from other regional banks also while commercial premium finance loans were down by million in the first quarter based on historic seasonality we would anticipate that this portfolio would show solid growth in q2 as noted in prior earnings call we continue to be optimistic about loan growth in but would anticipate the pace of growth may turn closer to the lower end of the guidance for a number of reasons the wintrust life finance portfolio grew by million during the first quarter of compared to million in the first quarter of the rapid increases in rates during the past year have significantly affected the pace of growth we would anticipate the slower rate of growth will continue in this high rate environment and increases in commercial line utilization excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines continue to flatten during the first quarter reflecting a more cautious business sentiment and higher borrowing costs as a result while we continue to be diligent about and preparing for the possibility of a business recession we believe our diversified portfolio and position within the competitive banking landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid to highsingle digits and maintain our credit discipline from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen a number of ways nonperforming loans remain stable at basis points or million equal to the total we saw in q4 overall npls continue to be at historically low levels and we are still confident about the solid credit metrics of the portfolio chargeoffs for the quarter were only million or basis points and as detailed on slide we saw a stable level in our special mention and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level finally as ed mentioned the granularity of our loan portfolio has always been a critical pillar of the wintrust story this can be seen clearly on slide where the portfolio has been built around commercial cre premium finance and niche lending currently commercial real estate loans comprise roughly a quarter of our portfolio while we closely monitor all elements of our loan portfolio we are paying particular attention to this segment higher borrowing costs and pressure on lease rates are cause for concern particularly in the office category on slide we have highlighted a number of important elements of our office portfolio currently this portfolio totals billion or of our total cre portfolio and only of our total loan portfolio of the billion of office exposure close to is medical office or owner occupied the average size of a loan in the office portfolio was only million we have only five loans in the portfolio above million there has been significant concern about office properties located within the central business districts our cbd exposure is limited to million or approximately one quarter of the office portfolio half of this is in chicago wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 and half of this is in other cities the bulk of the portfolio is located in suburban areas in areas outside cbds and portfolio performance today has been very good with no loans currently over days past due we continue to perform portfolio reviews regularly in this portfolio and have stayed very engaged with our borrowers we are not immune from macro effects that challenges product type but we believe our portfolio is wellconstructed very granular and should perform well moving forward as noted earlier higher borrowing costs and pressure on lease renewals are having a meaningful effect across the cre space to better understand how these issues could impact our portfolio our cre credit team has performed a deep dive analysis on every loan over million which well be renewing between now and year end this analysis which covered of all cre loans maturing this year resulted in the following more than of these loans will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates roughly of these loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a shortterm extension at prevailing rates and approximately of the loans will require some additional attention which could include a paydown or a pledge of additional collateral we have tentative agreement on renewal terms with more than half of the borrowers in this final group again our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates but we have been diligently identifying any potential weaknesses in the portfolio and working with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to tim timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp thanks rich before ed wraps up and we take a few questions just a couple of comments first maybe the events of the last three weeks of march serve as a good reminder that as much as people think of banks as a commodity we believe thats absolutely not the case we continue to be uniquely positioned to take advantage of disruption in the market we frequently talk about that on these calls relative to many of our larger peer banks we provide a distinctly different experience we provide a level of service that our customers value evidenced by the jd power and greenwich and other awards we received and weve stayed very disciplined with respect to credit and risk management even when some havent we have a diversified mix of consumer and commercial businesses built on strong relationships our model has really been all about being the best alternative to larger banks and that opportunity continues to exist today and in some ways more than ever and so ill pause there and ed ive got some wrapup comments at the end but thats what ive got edward joseph wehmer chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp okay thank you tim well as you know this is my last earnings call im going to miss the banner and relationships ive had with all of you that being said i will still be involved in the foreseeable future in a limited capacity as chairman make no mistake about it though theres only going to be one ceo thats going to be tim if were going to have one guys hands on the wheel thatll be his im here to help and service and i can do wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 to help continue this organization to go in the great growth its had i thank all of you for your support through the ages other than the shorties out there hope you continue to lose money on wintrust i can assure you that wintrust is in great hands well continue to follow through and thrive no matter the issue we have the best management team and people in the business as always you can be assured of the teams best efforts in that regard tim back to you timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp great why dont we go ahead and open it up for questions and have a quick summary at the end question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey ed thanks for everything fun earnings calls over the last or so years and the wehmerisms are priceless so thank you for all of those edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp youre welcome jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah it was great guys i want to ask you a little bit about the margin the guidance maybe obvious but talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes and the factors that would drive it up or down from there and share with us what kind of interest rate and deposit flow assumptions that youre building into that outlook timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah sure jon its tim obviously the deposit mix has been one of the changes thats put some pressure on the margins the other as dave mentioned is kind of the hedging activities that we think will provide good support for the margin in a lower rate environment were getting back to a dda mix thats similar to pre wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 pandemic and so the hope is that that migration slows but thats certainly one of the things that were watching pretty carefully and the other is our opportunity to grow we think weve got really nice loan opportunities in the market right now and working hard to use our 15charter model to grow deposits and to take advantage of some dislocation in the market so those would be a couple of the factors going forward the hedge expense is a little bit higher in terms of the basis points goes to something like basis points but again we think thats a prudent investment at this point jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp we put a deck in the slide deck we put a presentation about the swaps that we added during the quarter but since they were only on for part of the quarter there was only a partial hit so that sort of includes going from to basis points jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp on that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp on those derivative positions so thats part of the equation too but we noted this last quarter too and i noted it in my comments but we still have a fair amount of asset data out there too to offset some of the deposit pressure that we saw i mean the main decrease there is really the sort of the mix shift and then people moving into the interestbearing deposits from dda but we do have billion roughly of premium financed loans that still repriced over the course of the year and as that repricing occurs that will substantially offset the deposit repricing that we expect to continue a little bit here in the future so we hope to hold it there sort of where it was at the end of the quarter a little less than we thought because of this deposit mix but we think were positioned well and as tim said we really think our positioning in chicago is wonderful we are chicagos bank we win all these awards for good customer service and we get those awards because we give good customer service and if we go out in this environment and sell our products we think we can grow deposits and fund this loan growth thats out there and theres a lot of things in the mix but weve wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 always been able to manage through it before so we think that number we can hold and hold through the rest of the year assuming something really dramatic doesnt happen to the yield curve indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats in the rate assumption of the forward curve is that right timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah pretty much jon were kind of thinking well get one more here at some point in the second quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay rich maybe for you on loan growth dave alluded to that as one of the keys to holding that you talked about slower utilization is that pre or post march and how dramatically have things changed in terms of your pipelines and demands since march thanks richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah well utilization i think really has been almost the entirety of the year i mean weve just seen that utilization kind of just flat we anticipated it would come up a little bit more back to more historic norms but i think the higher borrowing costs really have put a chill on that a little bit again its not down dramatically but just not recovering to the levels that we had seen historically in terms of overall loan demand as i talked about i think we have a big tailwind with our property and casualty group because we can already see the fundings that are going to be coming here over the course of the rest of this year but i think the thing that is most encouraging is that our core pipeline ci and cre both are at very good levels and again im not necessarily sure if its the pie growing or but my suspicion is we just continue to see opportunities coming out of large banks other regionals where theyre just pulsing in and out of the market the ability to get a timely answer has really been an issue and our teams have been very quick to respond and were just seeing continued opportunity in that space so those are the things that i would point to as being most opportunistic about jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thanks guys appreciate it timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james your question please david wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone and thanks edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp hey david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc for taking my question just to start out ed i know youre not going away but you will be missed on these calls going forward really appreciate your candor over the years and i want to wish you the best as you hand over the reign to tim and the rest of the team and do look forward to seeing you again sometime so edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thanks david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc congratulations edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thank you david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc as far as the thinking about the quarter here the interest rate hedges looks like you maybe added a couple of here in early april puts you close to about billion in notional value will you go much higher than that do you have a limit as to how high you want to go or is this sort of a kind of like your overall strategy take what the market gives you here timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp i think a little bit of the latter david well kind of see where the curve goes here but as you can see from the interest sensitivity slides that we include in the deck were getting close to the point where were more neutral than not so we think these last couple were nice adds we caught the market at a good time and if rates start to drift downward weve got a little bit of insurance that will help us here so again opportunistic david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then you talked about the mix getting closer to where you were prepandemic now most of the last years weve been in a zero interest rate environment outside of what and really can noninterest bearing deposits drop materially from here go back to pregfc years ago the average for the industry was wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 almost half of what its been since then can we go back that low or is there structural changes that wont allow noninterestbearing deposits to go down to to for the industry how do you see that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well i think for us the structural change has been the growth of our commercial businesses and so they carry with them dda deposits related to paying for both treasury services and excess so i would hope that we dont go back that low and that weve got some very material differences in terms of how we looked pre2008 or but clearly the events of the second half of march have everybody to looking at their deposits very carefully and so those conversations continue around the bank but our treasury results continue to be good so more and more of the balances here are used to pay for treasury and other services david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks ill jump back in the queue thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great echo the nice words towards ed edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thanks chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc in terms of the of course tim or dave maybe on the margin the i think indiscernible the next couple of quarters maybe more a medium term question if the forward curve plays out and you get cuts next year like how much downside from do you see david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i mean it depends on how steep you think its going to drop i guess you can look at our like our hedges but we think were fairly balanced as far as our deposits on our loans go weve really mitigated the upside and the downside so we give that sensitivity in the press release but like the derivatives if you look at that we probably average out in the on the swaps in a high3 range and so if rates came down basis points then those would actually start to contribute to the margin so probably a little bit of pressure down basis points and then after that we hold on but in the prior cycle when the pandemic hit and rates dropped dramatically as you know our margin fell into the mid we think this margin would stay in the so we think weve mitigated some of that downside risk but i guess it depends on the shape of the curve and the slope of it but were hoping to hang onto it fairly substantially with a little bit of pressure if rates drop dramatically until the mortgage could kick back again to offset that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great maybe just two followups i think in the past you talked kind of highsingle digit expense growth i appreciate the color for next quarter but just given the changes in the environment is that still like a reasonable zip code for a full year and then also can you help us on the covered call trajectory obviously youre pretty active there thanks timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah well have to see whether the regulators do anything dramatic that would change but barring that i dont think we have a different outlook for our expense structure this year were pleased with this quarter there are some unique attributes that kept it lower like the health insurance claims were down a little bit et cetera but and mortgages are sort of at their low point as far as things go we hope mortgages actually pick up here which will increase the expense base but well have more revenue yeah there too so thats not a bad reason for the expenses to increase but we still hold on to that for a full year there will be some increase as i said in the second quarter with the acquisition and the marketing and indiscernible health insurance claims will probably normalize et cetera but we sort of focus on the netnet because as wealth goes up on the revenue side the expenses go up too and as mortgages goes up on the revenue side expenses go up and so its hard to peg that expense number specifically so were still targeting that net overhead ratio and it sort of takes into account the fluctuations of those revenue streams going up and down with market conditions but yeah i dont see anything dramatically structurally changing here right now its really its the deposit cost side of the equation that had a little bit of impact this quarter with the sort of the structural mix shift there that happened this whole situation sort of woke up the sleeping hibernating bear as far as people looking at their rates paid on deposits and i think weve seen a substantial part of that move already so i dont expect it to have a similar shift this quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great and how about the covered call outlook timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp it sort of depends on where rates are at but usually helps protect the downside rate environment as we invest the volatility at the beginning of this year the covered call fee income if you go back over time this was a little bit of a higher level than wed seen over the prior four quarters but there was higher volatility and the fee range is based on the volume of securities that you write calls against but also volatility we saw much higher volatility so i would expect that to be down a little bit in the second quarter as we just said weve been retaining a lot of those securities of liquidity just to be cautious early in the quarter so well see how it plays out the rest of the quarter but i imagine thats down a little bit but therell still be some christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks thanks ed wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks just one followup for me the ramp scenario that you guys highlight credit cards down just curious what kind of deposit beta you guys anticipate and mix under that kind of scenario which is obviously pretty good timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah i mean i think im not sure i understand the nuance of your question maybe casey but were assuming that were going to get probably to a 50ish range for the full cycle here and so sort of depends on the timing of those cuts but as you can see and kind of the progression of those numbers in i want to say table dave right weve narrowed our asset sensitivity position dramatically over the last four or five quarters here so if im not doing a good job answering your question try again here casey haire q analyst jefferies llc no thats right so its a similar pace on the way down as it was on the way up edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp fall will be fast timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah no down would be a little bit faster than on the way up casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah right timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp wed lag on the way up we would be quicker on the way down so itd be a little bit accelerated and i think you can see that because on the up casey haire q analyst jefferies llc right timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 we make on the upside under the ramp scenario but only on the downside so a little bit faster cuts in deposit rates on the downside i dont have the exact data for that at my fingertips but a little bit faster casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay just one more i think i know the answer but just wanted to check with loan growth a little slower here any appetite for share buyback timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp we dont plan on it right now we certainly have an appetite because we think we all believe were undervalued here but i think wed like to see how this plays out a little bit as rich said the loan growth was a little slower this quarter but pipelines are more higher at the end of the first quarter than they were at the end of the fourth quarter theres good loan demand out there so we will play this out and see how that goes wed rather reinvest in the business and take advantage of this disruptive market like weve done in the past and go raise deposits and bring in new clients and expand the franchise so i think were going to see how that plays out first so thats always been our goal is to grow the franchise and take advantage of disruption casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks ed best wishes in retirement hope you spent a lot of time at wrigley edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp i will tonight operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning i also just want to echo everyone elses comments and wishing you well ed as you transition to chairman its been great working with you over the years edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thanks nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co just kind of thinking about the deposit growth outlook from here it sounds like you guys had the nice inflows year todate with the maxsafe products so curious how much of that occurred post the bank failures that we saw in early march and just kind of how our deposit flows trending quartertodate and just kind of the overall outlook for core deposit growth over the course of this year within the context so maybe kind of what youre seeing in terms wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 of opportunities to add new relationships in the wake of some of the marelated disruption that weve seen in chicago lately timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah there were a couple of questions in there nate one with respect to maxsafe we were growing deposits prior to march but clearly that activity accelerated the demand for sort of insurancerelated products and maxsafe and the other reciprocal products that can handle even larger amounts got a lot of airtime and a lot of popularity so the majority of the maxsafe growth occurred in march we continue to think were really really wellpositioned though and so this is the time of year were kind of wrestling some tax outflows as well we think were kind of weathering those just fine quartertodate as rich kind of inferred the loan growth is pretty good the deposits remain stable and weve actually paid down some of the home loan borrowings so we think were in a pretty good place here and were very focused on growing deposits and continuing to fund the loan growth nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay got it and then just in terms of the balance sheet size from here and specifically the earning asset base it was kind of stable quarteroverquarter is that kind of a reasonable expectation to assume for the next couple of quarters as you just take securities cash flow runoff and redeploy that into kind of mid to lowsingle digit loan growth or how you guys kind of think about kind of overall earning asset growth from here david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we sort of like where our securities positions are at we would expect the balance sheet to grow i mean were going to out and market our deposit products in the communities and our consumer deposits grew during the quarter and we expect that to continue to go on in the middle market space were strong in and with the pipelines pull we expect to bring in new customers so our expectation is that we will grow the balance sheet through deposits and that translates into loan growth and not just run the securities portfolio down to fund that growth edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp indiscernible we won the jd power award again this year three out of four years we won it another eight indiscernible awards this year saying our products are better than the big guys we dont have to sell here plus our positioning as local bank and we have some real neat ideas about helping people move their accounts its a pain in the neck to move your primary account and weve got some great ideas out there that were instituting and again the charters we have were going to offer a teaser rate in the lower in our smaller locations not cannibalize so i think were in great shape in that regard weve got to go through it we always do nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats helpful and if i could just ask one more on the recently closed rothschild acquisition any kind of guide rails that you guys can provide in terms of kind of the fee or expense impact or just kind of what you guys expect to have in terms of the pretax margin from those assets and team joining wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah initially expenses might be a little higher because as we transition it into ours theyve got some duplicate systems until we convert and the like and so therell probably be some integration expenses but that number is probably in the second quarter somewhere in the million to million range with some of the transitional integration costs and fees obviously we will make a margin on that we havent disclosed what the fees are yet we just i dont necessarily want to give away what our pricing is on those assets that we acquired but i think you can sort of ballpark it pretty well with that background nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah is the pretax margin just similar to what you guys currently earn on great lakes advisors thats sound kind of a good proxy dave david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i would think that their business would their asset managed business would be very very similar to ours and so on timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp again with the frontend implementation expense though so a little bit of time to get there david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah but we can create leverage combining the systems it was a its a nice add on to the assets under management and will give us leverage so it might take us a couple of quarters to squeeze all of the integration stuff out but were very excited about the acquisition very excited about the team that were bringing on and look forward to continue to have that be a growth area for our fee income nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got you thats great i appreciate all the color thanks again guys timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brody preston of ubs your question please brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i wanted to just follow up on the on nates line of questioning on the rothschild just on the expenses you said million to million but some of thats wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 transitional i guess could you help us think about as you once those transitional costs are out of the run rate what you think the goforward run rate specifically to rothschild acquisition will be timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp million to 6ish million something like that again were a whole two weeks into this in terms of our implementation activities so david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah it just depends on how we grow that business and if like if we can grow that business more then theres a little bit more expense thatll go with it but million plus or minus timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you for that and then i just wanted to circle back on the swaps i appreciate the detail on slide so i can kind of try to work through that myself but i did just want to ask if you could clarify for us like how much of the in the margin at quarter end how much was were the swaps negatively impacting that just in terms of basis points timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp its about basis points and we would project since we added some in the first quarter that that number would go up david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah but thats basis points for the full for the quarter timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp correct david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp but that probably has timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp to wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp to basis points on it as well brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay yeah yeah yeah that was the number i was looking for thank you for that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp okay brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc and then i just want to ask just one last one or well two just on the nibs you guys arent unique in this sense that the nibs have been pressured but i did just want to ask like do you have a good sense for like when the tide kind of could stem there like are you kind of close to what you would think would be the level that your customers need to keep from an operational account perspective are you expecting to see more headwinds on a noninterest bearing going forward timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah i mean i think hard to say i mean again were growing the amount of dda deposits that are required at the bank to pay for services and were adding commercial relationships so is there going to be more migration i dont know we clearly think weve talked to most of our largest clients over the last several weeks in some cases more than once but its kind of hard to say and i dont think were an outlier i think were kind of seeing what everybody else is seeing here david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean our gut would sort of say its stabilized that theres an initial if people paid attention to their bank accounts all of a sudden and realize that theres some interest bearing monies they could move away or throw into maxsafe or whatever brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i think that weve probably seen the bulk of it we actually think its probably stabilized but your guess is as good as mine as far as what the industry may do but we do think that they do need this base level of accounts there to pay for fees and operate their businesses and thats our best guess right now is its stabilized but wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay yeah i understand its tough and then the last one i had was just rich i wanted to just followup on the detail you gave on the on the cre analysis particularly as it relates to the that are anticipated to either be paid off or require a short term extension at prevailing rate so i think the prevailing rates part is the key right like you obviously you think that in the short term these borrowers could support a higher rate but it sounds like just the way you phrased it that you dont necessarily think these are credits that you would want on balance sheet for from a longer term extension standpoint so could you help us think through whats going on with that or you say yeah you can afford it but we dont necessarily think we want to keep you richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp i think thats not the case so those are really its a more construction loans things like that where we have financed and have a mini perm and longterm fixed rate loans typically are not where we want to put a lot of those assets and there are better alternatives out in the market so those thats just part of where we fit into the spectrum in cre so these are thats what we typically see all the time our runoff on cre is substantial so we would anticipate that that will continue to be the case and those these are loans that are stabilized and ready to go and we anticipate thatll move out without a problem brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it so its really that last bucket the that require additional attention where youre spending more of your time richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp exactly thats our focus right now are those that because of the market dynamics we talk about rising rates and pressured leasing activity that theyre not at our required debt service coverage and so theyre going to have to figure out how to go through paydowns or additional collateral or something were going to have to figure out a better strategy edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp indiscernible richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah no were already in agreement with of those identified loans weve already identified sort of the path forward for better than half of them and generally speaking because i think we are very thoughtful about client selection we should be able to reach agreement in the great majority if not all brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for that color i appreciate you taking my questions wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp no problem david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jeff rulis of da davidson jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just wanted to circle back of the optimism on the pipeline could you remind us what that actually is as you entered the quarter versus where it was at the start of the year david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah we havent disclosed that but generally in the past its been running in the last few quarters just for commercial and commercial real estate not the like the premier finance and the niche businesses there are the residential real estate but just the commercial and commercial real estate i think our growth pipelines have generally been in the billion to billion range and i think were more in the billion to billion and now that doesnt mean those are all going to close thats the pipeline and timing isnt always one year but the fact i look at that more as a barometer as to how is loan demand shaping up and so it has increased in the first quarter now whether that all comes true or not is im not saying that thats the case but generally our pipelines are good indicator of demand and future closings so up a little bit but still relatively stable its not like it went from billion to billion but it inched up a little bit jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp and the other thing is that as dave pointed out thats of course cre and ci that doesnt include the leasing portfolio which weve seen really good activity in so far this year as we also talked about in the in my comments the commercial premium finance group where were seeing fairly robust growth through the rest of the year so and earlier on somebody may have said that our guidance has changed it hasnt changed we just had indicated that with a slower first quarter and just where the economy is in general we would anticipate that its going to be to the mid or bottom end of that range of mid to high single digits so just a point of clarification there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay right yeah thats helpful those last comments you sound optimistic i think youre kind of maybe hedging that a bit just macro and a slow start but so again the guidance is mid to high and maybe youre going to hug the mid for now but kind of continued update is helpful just edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp and rich mentioned this one of the wild cards obviously is what our competitors are doing and thats a little bit hard to determine over the last month than it typically is so just another factor jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yes fair enough and just kind of related front my other question just sounds like youre getting some opportunities organically but i wanted to check back in on the ma side and your thoughts obviously a volatile environment but also opportunity potentially so any thoughts on looking at whole bank or you look at more of the like what youve done on the wealth management side any thoughts on the acquisition front timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp right yeah as you recall the last two have been nonbank the wealth management acquisition as well as about a little over a year ago the allstate agent finance weve talked about a fair amount of sort of exploratory activity that really hasnt turned into much because its been tough to come to agreement with sellers but we think that maybe opening up a little bit here were getting a few more inbound phone calls and some more exploration well continue to be opportunistic if they make sense but were also disciplined and so well see what happens but probably activity kind of picking up a little bit edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp i would expect it to continue to pick up as this whole cycle hits those billion to billion banks and they have lots of problems and issues and kind of ready to throw the towel in and we as tim said activity has picked up jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it thank you and congrats ed and look forward to the future yeah thanks edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thank you timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yes thanks wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger of hovde group your line is open ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hi thanks guys most of the questions have been asked and answered so i appreciate all the color but i was curious if we can just think like kind of 10000foot view here wintrust has really never had a longterm growth problem you guys are in perpetual growth mode which is good the deposits have been pretty tight to get across the industry especially deposit loan was was going down in quantitative tightening the cost has gone up so just in general do you have any internal red lines in terms of loantodeposit ratio i mean if growth kind of reaccelerates which is kind of alluded to here where would kind of be the internal red line that we yeah we need to get more deposits regardless of cost timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well i dont know about the regardless of cost but we think theres deposit opportunities out there weve tried to be pretty disciplined through this cycle as rates have moved up and weve not gotten ahead of what we believe to be the loan growth opportunities but were going to be working pretty hard on deposits and weve said before we dont want to be loan to deposit we probably dont want to be so i think youll see us working very hard to grow deposits to try and match the loan growth benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay and then when you just think kind of economically speaking i know you guys were a bit ahead of the curve in terms of kind of saying that inflation is not transitory when you guys position today it seems like economically were slowing down and the fed is likely to probably cut sometime in the next months or so is there any areas that intentionally tape break tapping in terms of growth or excuse me loan growth or new areas youre kind of avoiding timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp no i dont i mean rich can chime in here too i dont think categorically theres anything that were saying we either will or wont do but were obviously monitoring the rate impacts on our clients and for many of them down is good but well see richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i know i agree with what tim just said i one of the lines that we use a lot around here with our lenders is we never want to be the bank that jerks the wheel we think that ultimately that does a lot of institutional harm by saying were not going to do that were not going to do this because it just makes indiscernible much more difficult to get back into it when you want to and our general thought is just be really thoughtful about who your sponsor is who your customer is what the structure of the deal is how the deal is priced its just weve been at this for a long time and we just really want to focus in on that theres office is a great example would we do another office deal absolutely if its structured the right way weve got the right tenant mix and weve got the right borrower and we got the right collateral structure so its just we are trying to be very thoughtful i think as we talked about here the granularity of our portfolio and the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 way its structured allows us that flexibility if i had a portfolio that was cre in most of that office i feel a lot different but right now we are just trying to be opportunistic and also be really thoughtful about keeping dry powder for our customers benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you appreciate the color ed congratulations with the great franchise edward joseph wehmer a chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you i would now like to turn the conference back to tim crane for closing remarks sir timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp yeah thank you very much as i hope you can tell we continue to think were very wellpositioned coming off sort of atypical march timeframe here and were going to be working hard to grow deposits and take advantage of the opportunities available to us eds going to get mad at me but i do want to take one second just to remind everybody that coming off a record quarter and wellpositioned to the future is really a function of eds leadership and many of you on the call know ed personally and i hope as he transitions into a different role that youll have a chance to catch up with him but in years hes turned wintrust into chicago and milwaukees bank with several marketleading national businesses and hes done it in a way thats been fun for employees good for our communities appreciated by our customers and we hope rewarding for those that have been invested in our bank so ed on behalf of the whole team i just want to say thank you and wish you well edward joseph wehmer chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp thanks tim ill be around timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp yeah i know edward joseph wehmer chief executive officer founder wintrust financial corp id say dont screw it up timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 yeah so with that obviously if there are more questions feel free to reach out to us offline and as ed always says we
