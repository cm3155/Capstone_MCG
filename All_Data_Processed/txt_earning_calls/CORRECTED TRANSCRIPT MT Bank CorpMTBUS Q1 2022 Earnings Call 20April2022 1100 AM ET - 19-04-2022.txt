as we reflect on the past quarter it was an eventful one first off we were pleased to have closed the acquisition of peoples united financial on april 1st and to welcome our new colleagues customers and shareholders to the mt family were excited to turn our complete focus to successfully integrating peoples united of course not losing sight of the tenets that define mt delivering superior customer service offering rewarding careers for our colleagues engaging in the communities we call home and providing top quartile longterm returns to shareholders we plan on completing systems conversion in the third quarter this year subsequent to our january earnings calls the outlook for interest rates has changed materially low levels of unemployment and continued supply chain disruptions exacerbated by the situation in ukraine have pushed inflation to levels not seen since the early interest rates began to rise even before the federal reserve raised its fed funds target in late march and the forward curve anticipates additional hikes coming more quickly than we anticipated in january the change in rate environment created an opportunity for us to deploy excess cash into investment securities at a faster pace than we previously outlined and to restart our interest rate hedging program while were beginning to see the tailwinds from rising interest rates positively impacting our net interest income those same higher rates have prompted headwinds to our mortgage banking business both for origination volumes and for gain on sale margins we expect these headwinds to persist despite these macro challenges credit quality remains strong and expense growth has been well managed were wellpositioned for the future and excited about the opportunity to integrate the peoples united franchise as well as to deploy our excess cash and excess capital now lets review our results for the first quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the first quarter of compared to in the fourth quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linkedquarter on a gaap basis mts first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on assets just shy of at and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share down slightly from the prior quarter also included in this quarters results were mergerrelated expenses of million related to the peoples united acquisition this amounted to million after tax or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever exclude the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions mts net operating income for the first quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the mergerrelated expenses was million compared with million in the linkedquarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared to in 2021s fourth quarter net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the fourth quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results including tangible assets and equity included in the recent quarters gaap and net operating results was a million distribution from bayview lending group this amounted to million aftertax effect and per common share we received a light distribution in the fourth quarter of as well as the fourth quarter of next well look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated these results taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the first quarter of a decrease of million or from the linked quarter the primary drivers of the decline were million in lower interest income and fees from ppp loans as well as a million reduction of interest accrued on earning assets reflecting the twoday shorter calendar quarter those factors were partially offset by higher rates on interestearning assets and cash interest received on nonaccrual loans the net interest margin for the past quarter was up basis points from in the linkedquarter the primary driver of the increase to the margin was a reduced level of cash held on deposit at the federal reserve which we estimate boosted the margin by basis points that was partially offset by a 4basispoint decline resulting from the lower income from ppp loans rising interest rates had a modest 1basispoint benefit to the margin as the fed action on the fed funds target came relatively late in the quarter all other factors including day count and interest received on nonaccrual loans had a negligible impact on the margin compared with the fourth quarter of average interestearning assets decreased by some or billion reflecting a billion decline in money market placements including cash on deposit at the fed partially offset by a million increase in investment securities average loans outstanding decreased by about compared with the previous quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linkedquarter commercial and industrial loans increased by million or about that figure includes the decrease of approximately million in ppp loans that decrease was more than offset by million growth in dealer floor plan balances and a billion increase in all other ci loans commercial real estate loans declined by compared with the fourth quarter three factors contributed to that decline elevated payoff activity was the primary driver including several criticized and nonaccrual loans assumed by other lenders the quarter also saw construction loans converted into permanent offbalance sheet financing often facilitated by our mt realty capital corporation subsidiary and finally new origination activity remained subdued compared to prior years residential real estate loans declined by consistent with our expectations the change reflects new loans originated and retained for investment which were more than offset by normal runoff combined with the sale of ginnie mae buyouts as they became eligible for repooling into new rmbs consumer loans were up nearly activity was consistent with recent quarters where growth in indirect auto and recreational finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 on an endofperiod basis ppp loans amounted to just million average core customer deposits which excludes cds over decreased about or some billion compared with the fourth quarter that figure was roughly evenly divided between noninterestbearing and interest checking trust demand deposits drove the decline in demand deposits following lower levels of capital markets activity compared with the fourth quarter the decline in interest checking reflects our ongoing program to manage deposit pricing downward while our liquidity profile remains so strong some higher cost escrow deposits were moved off our balance sheet to other institutions willing to pay higher rates turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the first quarter compared with million in the linkedquarter as noted mt received a million distribution from bayview lending group in each of the past two quarters mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linkedquarter revenues from our residential mortgage banking business were million in the first quarter compared with million in the prior quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the fourth quarter both figures reflect our decision to retain a substantial majority of mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet the primary driver of the linkedquarter revenue decline is the higher interest rate environment has pressured gain on sale margins for loans previously purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools and which have become eligible for resale or repooling although these loans typically have higher rates than new originations that difference has been narrowing residential gain on sale totaled million in the recent quarter compared with million in the prior quarter commercial banking revenues were million in the first quarter reflecting a decline from million in the linkedquarter that figure was million in the yearago quarter as a reminder the commercial mortgage banking business tends to show seasonal swings revenues totaled million in the first half of compared with million in the second half which also included an elevated of prepayment fees trust income was million in the recent quarter little change from the previous quarter but up from the yearago quarter service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the fourth quarter that decline primarily reflects seasonal factors the previously announced repricing of our consumer checking products did not have a significant impact on the first quarter but we expect foregone revenues from the program to reach a run rate of million per quarter by the second half of the year turning to expenses operating expenses for the first quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and mergerrelated expenses were million the comparable figures were million in the linkedquarter and million in the yearago quarter as is typical for mts first quarter results operating expenses for the recent quarter which included approximately million of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement eligible employees like don macleod also it reflects the hsa contribution the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401k match and fica payments as well as the annual reset in fica payments and unemployment insurance mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately million in last years first quarter as usual we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter aside from these seasonal factors that flow through salaries and benefits operating expenses declined by million compared with the fourth quarter lower professional services costs as well as lower pensionrelated costs drove that decline the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2021s fourth quarter and in the first quarter of those ratios in the first quarters of and each reflect the seasonally elevated compensation expenses next lets turn to credit despite the challenges of the pandemic and its variants supply chain disruptions labor shortages and persistent inflation credit is stable to improving the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the first quarter little change from the end of we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter which was partially offset by just million of net chargeoffs as the covid19 pandemic eases forecasted economic indicators continue to show improvement from the prior period but inflation remains persistently high with upward pressure from energy prices and constrained supply chains which have been impacted by russias invasion of ukraine the first quarters baseline macroeconomic forecast consider these developments although theres a little difference in the forecast from the prior quarter for those indicators that have a significant impact on our cecl modeling results including the unemployment rate gdp growth and residential and consumer real estate values the result of these considerations is an allowance for credit losses that is consistent with our prior estimate nonaccrual loans increased very slightly amounting to billion that equaled of loans at the end of march up slightly from at the end of last year when we file our first quarter 10q in a few weeks we expect to report a modest decline in criticized loans as noted net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were just basis points for the first quarter which we believe is an alltime low that figure was basis points in the fourth quarter loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter in total of these days past due loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the fourth quarter this ratio reflects earnings net of dividends combined with a slight reduction in riskweighted assets tangible common equity totaled billion down just from the end of the prior quarter tangible common equity per share amounted to down or percentage point from the end of the fourth quarter this very moderate decline reflects our patience in deploying excess liquidity into longduration investments until the interest rate outlook became clearer as previously announced we expect to resume the repurchase of mt common shares shortly starting with the million buyback program recently reauthorized by our board now turning to the outlook on april 1st we closed the peoples united acquisition that development combined with the rapid change in interest rate expectations have had a material impact on our outlook for full year the information that follows reflects the combined balance sheet a more recent forward curve and includes three quarters of operations from peoples united first lets talk about our outlook for the balance sheet excluding the impact of acquisition accounting adjustments at closing we acquired billion in total assets including investment securities totaling billion cash placed mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 at the federal reserve totaling billion loans of billion and other assets of billion deposits totaled billion borrowings and other liabilities totaled about billion each and equity totaled billion the purchase consideration was approximately billion with the increase in rates the deal is now expected to be slightly dilutive to tangible book value per share however this also means that future earnings will benefit from additional acquisition accounting accretion lets go into a little more detail on our outlook for growth in the combined balance sheet first the interestearning cash position at the beginning of the second quarter totaled just over billion we expect these balances to decline to slightly under billion by the end of due to a combination of growth in the securities portfolio loan growth as well as a reduction in wholesale funding investment securities for the combined company totaled billion at the beginning of the second quarter and we expect to grow the portfolio by billion per quarter this cadence could accelerate or slow depending on market conditions we start this quarter with billion in ci loans including just over million in ppp loans cre residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios are billion billion and billion respectively in order to provide more details on our outlook for loan growth lets first look at our expectations for spot or end ofperiod loan growth from the beginning of the second quarter through the end of total combined loans are expected to grow in the to range from the beginning of the second quarter excluding ppp and ginnie mae buyout loan balances total combined loans are expected to grow in the to range the outlook for ci loan growth excluding ppp loans is in that same to range with solid growth in dealer floor plan balances ppp loans are expected to continue to pay down over the course of the year and not have a material impact on loan growth for cre loans we expect the heightened level of payoffs to largely run their course and thus the outlook for total combined cre loans is essentially flat for the rest of this year the tailwinds from our mortgage retention strategy are expected to help drive to loan growth in residential mortgage balances over the course of this year and excluding the impact of the repooling of ginnie mae buyouts growth is expected to be in the to range of course mortgage rates and home supply will ultimately affect that pace of growth finally were pleased with the momentum in our consumer loan portfolio and expect this growth to continue to be strong over the remainder of the year we anticipate growth in the to range in this portfolio to help you understand the outlook for endofperiod growth or how the outlook for endofperiod loan growth ties into growth in the average balance sheet when compared to standalone mt average balances we expect average loans for the combined franchise to grow in the to range when compared to standalone mt full year average balances of billion on a combined and fullyear average basis we expect average ci growth in the to range we expect average cre growth in the to range and average residential mortgage growth in the to range and finally we expect average consumer loan growth in the to range as we look at the outlook for the combined income statement compared to standalone mt operations from we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from higher rates and to manage through the macro challenges we noted earlier on this call this outlook includes the impact from preliminary estimates of acquisition accounting marks that are expected to be finalized later in the quarter our outlook for net interest income for the combined franchise is for fullyear growth compared to the billion in we expect that growth to be plus or minus depending on the speed of interest rate hikes mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 by the fed and the pace of the deployment of excess liquidity as well as loan growth this outlook reflects the forward yield curve from the beginning of this month turning to the fee businesses while higher rates are expected to pressure mortgage originations and gain on sale margins growth in trust revenue should benefit from the recapture of money market fee waivers sooner than previously anticipated we expect noninterest income to grow in the to range for the full year compared to billion in next our outlook for full year operating noninterest expenses is impacted by the timing of the peoples united system conversion and subsequent realization of expense synergies we anticipate to growth in combined operating noninterest expenses when compared to billion in as a reminder these operating noninterest expenses do not include pretax mergerrelated charges at the time of the merger announcement onetime pretax merger charges were estimated at million including million of capitalized expenditures these merger charges are not expected to be materially different than these initial estimates we expect the majority of these merger charges to be incurred in the second and third quarters of this year turning to credit we continue to expect credit losses to remain well below mts legacy longterm average of basis points for we conservatively estimate that net chargeoffs for the combined company will be in the 20basispoint range as a reminder the provision for credit losses in this years second quarter will include provision related to the nonpurchase credit deteriorated loans from peoples united we are still finalizing the acquisition accounting marks but given the improvement in economic conditions over the past year this provision will likely be lower than the million pretax provision estimated at the time of the announcement the so called double count finally turning to capital due to the delay and growth in capital at both firms the preliminary combined cet1 ratio at closing should be over we believe this level of core capital is higher than what is needed to safely run the combined company and to support lending in our communities we plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace we will be participating in the dfast this year and again in normally next year would have been an off year for a category iv bank like mt however the federal reserve has reasonably requested that we participate again next year so that our stress test and stress capital buffer can be assessed including the balance sheet and operations of peoples united with a solid starting capital position and a potential to generate significant amounts of capital over the next few years we dont anticipate the test results causing a material change to our capital distribution plans our objective as always is to bring our cet1 ratio down gradually to a level that is near the high end of the lower quartile of our peer group based on that objective we anticipate ending with a cet1 ratio in the range as noted earlier we anticipate restarting the currently authorized million common share repurchase program now that the acquisition is closed now lets open up the call to questions before which gretchen will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to drill down a little bit on your comment around the returning excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace maybe you could give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that because obviously with loan growth coming in therell be a little bit of competition but not that much so i guess really the underlying question is how measured is measured in your mind darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so as we think about it betsy were going to go through the next couple quarters and the impact of some of the onetime expenses associated with the deal will have an impact on capital in addition to the buyback and so as we think about it it might be a little bit lumpy in a couple of these quarters but if you think about it over the course of the next three years is moving down in maybe the to 30basispoint per quarter range thats probably a good starting point a bit of the wild card obviously is also the pace of increase in the fed funds rates because of the combined banks asset sensitivity that will have a meaningful impact on net income and capital generation so well need to be monitoring that in addition to the pace of buybacks to hit that kind of to 30basispoint target so it might bounce around a bit but thats kind of when we think about it how we tend to think about it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just as a followup the expense savings can you just remind us the pace of the realization of those that youre anticipating darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so if we go back to the due diligence we were and continue to target about a decrease in the peoples united expense base and when you look at when that really starts to come in it really is in the fourth quarter of this year and will probably leak a little bit into the first quarter of next year just given the timing mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 most of the reduction in expenses is tied to the system conversion event and so typically after that youll have some folks who will stay on that time plus plus plus days just as we stabilize the operation and then those expenses will start to go away so it will really be as we get to maybe the december timeframe of this year that well hit that run rate and really into the first quarter of betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i was wondering if you could just go back to your nii guide i think you mentioned up yearoveryear all in with the deal just talk to us around thought process around pace of cash deployment what youre buying and where do you expect to keep excess cash maybe at the end of darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so i guess a couple of things on whats going on there in that just looking at the cash and the cash deployment some of it will be into securities we talked about pace of an incremental billion a quarter in growth in the securities portfolio net of runoff when you look at the securities portfolio and where weve been focused of late its been in the shorter end of the curve typically in the two to threeyear space i think if you look at how that curve looks you see that it kind of flattens out once you get to five years and so we dont see a benefit to that extra duration but part of the way were getting some of that duration is through the retention of the mortgages were originating through our retail channels and so part of the cash then is deployed into the residential mortgage balances that will sit on our balance sheet and then obviously the other loan growth that we talked about and those are the things that we think help bring the cash levels from the place we are combined in april of around billion down to billion the other part that i didnt mention was there is some wholesale funding that is coming through the merger and as we look at our cash position we think we can bring those wholesale balances down and fund them with the liquidity position that we have ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 understood and just tied to that on the funding side we saw some deposits runoff you talked about this last quarter remind us in terms of when you think about deposit balances where you expect them to trend and are there other kind of more rate sensitive indextype deposits that you expect to leave the balance sheet over the coming quarters darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess were not anticipating additional runoff in the deposit portfolio right now well go through i think the first basis points i think for us and generally for the industry given the loantodeposit ratios in the industry the deposits are likely to be sticky and we wont see much movement due to rates as we go through the cycle theres a cadence that happens with these the deposits that tend to be the most rate sensitive are usually those in the wealth business as well as in the municipal or government space and we tend to see betas move there a little bit faster in consumer land it takes a little bit longer for rates to start to drive behavior and over time youll see some movement out of checking accounts and into money market savings and time accounts but that will all be based on the pace at which the industry starts to move up rates just on time deposits there is a slightly higher time deposit portfolio at peoples than there has been in mt and you might see a little bit of runoff in the time deposits early on but as rates move assuming they move as anticipated at some point youll see those lines cross and that portfolio will stop shrinking and then on a combined basis it will start to grow but thats probably not the growth part is probably not until late this year early next year would be my guess just based on our past experience and where the forward curves are ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from matt oconnor from deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i was hoping you could flesh out the cet1 target and i guess just to be blunt like why so high i think its above where most of your peers are targeting and kind of appreciate youre converting a deal and youve got dfast that you want to see but is that kind of the intermediate target and over time youll bring it down maybe closer to the that we see from your peers or how did you arrive at the and how longterm is that darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah happy to answer the question matt the is a stepping stone along the way we havent changed our thought process about how we manage capital that were always looking to deploy it into the franchise first and always looking to support customers and loan growth within our markets and to the extent that thats not there at a reasonable return then we look to get it back to shareholders we always think about the dividend as an important element of that and we try to make sure we target as weve talked about before right around a third of earnings as a dividend payout target we think that gives us a good mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 flexibility to make sure that we can maintain that payment through the economic cycles and then we tend to favor using buybacks as the rest of it and the when you look at where were starting and you look at what we believe is going to be the capital generation of the combined organization against the backdrop of an assetsensitive franchise in a rising rate environment the capital generation we think becomes pretty compelling and so the pace of deployment against the pace of capital generation makes it tough to bring that ratio down very quickly and as you pointed out its an intermediate step but next year will be the first year we go through the stress test with our combined balance sheet and what the history has taught us is when you go through that first time there can be surprises in how the portfolios are treated or react under the fed stress test models and sometimes in those situations there can be data gaps that you need to remediate and so we understand those issues and challenges but we think that going into that test at that level is just a safer place to be and then well have more information when we come out the other side and expect to continue on our path down to the target that weve always talked about well obviously have to look at that target as we take into account the new balance sheet in the combined bank that we have because we are getting some new portfolios and well want to run them through our own stress test models to understand how they perform under stress but consider the as a stop along the journey towards our more typical target matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then on the liquidity im probably missing some sort of liquidity rule on this but why cant you and other banks that have tons of cash just dump it in shortterm treasuries weve seen very unusual move in the treasury market so you could basically accelerate all that rate leverage and not really take any risk right like a 6month treasury is about months is doesnt impact the cet1 i dont think so just remind us like what liquidity rules out there thats preventing you from doing that and if its not a rule why wouldnt you consider that thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah theres not a rule matt when youre going through for banks theyre subject to a liquidity coverage ratio theres an expectation about what percentage of their liquidity is held in highquality liquid assets i think the treasuries count but cash is one of the preferreds and so shorter duration cashoriented instruments would affect banks that are lcr banks which are category iii banks for a bank like mt were not subject to that but when we look at the benefit of locking in now at twoyear treasury versus where we see the forward curve going we think were going to get a lot of that just with the rate moves without having to lock it in but yeah we maintain the flexibility of that cash and we keep the marks off the balance sheet and so you can see were starting to buy in and well continue to build a portfolio that does take advantage of some of that while trying to protect the flexibility that we have and we still expect to benefit from the increase in rates and were trying to dollar cost average in a little bit into that position and really the focus for us i cant speak for others but the focus for us is over the course of the next couple years rebuilding the mix of the balance sheet between whats in cash whats in securities within the securities portfolio whats the duration of it how are we thinking about that with what is the duration of the whole portfolio and as we talked about with whats in mortgages mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 and then the other thing thats really important is how much cash and whats you our deposit runoff assumption right because if you get too far into the securities portfolio and all of a sudden you see some migration in deposits and youve got to go out and fund those or youve got to react to outflows with rate if you go too far too fast you can get yourself upsidedown and so obviously at two years theres a lot less risk of that but those are the kind of things that were always thinking about and debating internally when we think about the pace at which we want to deploy that cash into something that might over the course of the next couple quarters provide a higher yield but based on as i mentioned where it looks like the fed is moving you might catch up pretty quickly there in the cash matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and just to squeeze in what would be the longerterm target of call it securities to assets or maybe a securities plus residential mortgages is the way you think about it like you said rebuild and kind of remix next couple years and what was it the end state as you think about darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess the way to think about it matt is to look at the combination of our securities portfolio plus our on balance sheet mortgages and look at that as a percentage of assets and then look at where the peers sit and if you think about the peers who have the lower percentage of those so the bottom quartile of the peers when you add up securities and mortgages as a percentage of assets think that kind of range for us as weve talked about before our goal is always to deploy our liquidity into lending while making sure that were not taking on crazy asset sensitivity and so well look to bring that close that asset sensitivity down and those would be some of the primary categories in which we would look to do that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks for taking all my questions operator your next question comes from john pancari from evercore john your line is open you might be on mute darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp boy after two years of the pandemic weve still got mute operator and well take our next question from ken usdin from jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks a lot good morning guys hey darren just wondering if you could just drill down to a couple more pieces of nii first of all can you help us understand that you mentioned the accretion can you help us mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 understand how much accretion youre expecting either in dollar terms ideally or can help us understand the percentage that adds to growth darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure when you look at the nii like i mentioned were still finalizing what the marks are but when you look at the forecast for the year and the coming years the impact of the accretion will be positive compared to where we thought it would be when we announced obviously because of the change in the interest rate environment but when you look at the percentage it could move what we guided its maybe a couple percentage points in either direction more likely to be accretive than not really the bigger driver of the growth in nii is just the composition of obviously our balance sheet and our asset sensitivity and the new rate curve which is the biggest part of that driver ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay so there is accretion in there but youre saying it could be more than what you have in there but youre not going to until you finalize the marks youre not going to update us on just what the amount of the accretion is in there darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well give you all of the information once we finalize it but i guess what im saying is its not going to change the outcome in a meaningful way ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it and then just a second question just on you talked about some of the moving parts within the betas but can you just talk us about like what youre expecting for deposit betas and how that might have changed given the faster pace of expected hikes that were now seeing from the fed thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah no problem i guess we talked a little bit about deposit betas earlier on and its really when we disclose the sensitivity in the q what well see there is the first bps in the first bps we really dont think theres a lot of reactivity and really when we look at the bps we look at each bps and then well look at the subsequent bps but really we think the first bps has relatively low deposit betas probably in the to range probably towards the bottom end of that it skews by portfolio when you look as i mentioned before at some of the government and municipal deposits they tend to be a lot more rate sensitive as do the wealth balances and so those would drive up the deposit beta and for our smaller business customers and our consumer customers the betas are a little bit lower clearly as you get higher in the absolute level of fed funds you start to get a little bit more attention one of the things that i think is different this cycle from others not just for us but for the industry for all of us to keep in mind is theres now an ability to pay interest on commercial checking accounts which there hadnt been before and you would look at the impact on commercial balances historically would be on earnings credit and mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 then the offset on fees and from an interest perspective it was typically sweep accounts and it was either on or offbalance sheet now much of that will have it in those commercial checking accounts where clients will have to decide between earnings credit against fees or between earning an actual interest income based on the rate on those products and so its something we havent seen how reactive those specific products will be because we havent really been through a tightening cycle thats looking like the one thats in front of us but again big picture if you just go back to where loantodeposit ratios sit and all the liquidity that sits not just on our balance sheet but on others unless theres a meaningful change in that position or meaningful loan growth you probably have deposit betas that are at the lower end of what we saw in the last tightening cycle ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah got it thanks a lot darren makes sense operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey darren hows everything darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp doing great good morning how you been steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning good on asset sensitivity could you give color you said you restarted the hedging program in the quarter can you give color on what youre doing there and now that peoples has closed whats the new level of asset sensitivity versus what you guys last disclosed darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so ill go in reverse order the new level of asset sensitivity is slightly less than what it is mt standalone if you look at the two balance sheets both were asset sensitive and on a combined basis the asset sensitivity drops maybe percentage point point in that range we saw in the peoples portfolio over the course of the last year similar phenomenon that we did and that there has been some loan declines certainly ppp loans that paid off and turned into cash and so they were looking at managing their portfolio in a very similar fashion to how we were and so there really wasnt a big change in the combined asset sensitivity and then when you look at the hedging program what weve been trying to do is since we see the curve that is forecast we can use some forward starting swaps much like we had done in the prior cycle to lock in those increases before they happen so in effect if you see where are we today bps increases in fed funds you can lock that in with a forwardstarting position and then youd have to see or bps before you thought that was a bad decision and given the fact that youre still asset sensitive youd be pretty happy if that was the case mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 but being able to lock in some of these today you can protect in case the pace isnt at that level and so its really with some of those cash flow hedges very similar to how we built the portfolio last time we try to leg into it a little bit and build it out each month as we go forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats helpful and then for my followup question i want to go back to your response to betsys question on the cost save phasein are you still assuming in and is the number still million darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so im trying to think about thats not a number thats i know what youre thinking about i got it first year im with you now steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp just given the timing of when the deals happen well start to see that run rate achieved towards the end of the year is it this year were not going to see in actuality in calendar year just because were not doing the conversion until the third quarter right and so in reality well start to get to the run rate as we come out of the year and so really the way to think about it is it will really kick in full year in and then were still in the range of thinking that were around cost saves but keep in mind that the peoples expense base has changed so the dollars will be slightly different theyve seen the same thing we have with expense growth and wage inflation and so the good news is is in dollar terms the savings are probably a little bit higher because the cost went up but the reality is is the percentage save has really not changed much steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so dollars up a bit and basically by the end of the fourth quarter youll be at the run rate not the fourth quarter okay darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes not the fourth quarter yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah indiscernible darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 really like i mentioned a lot of its going to come out in the third quarter but theres always some residual some folks that are or days past conversion and if were doing the conversion around the early part of september a little bit of that leaks into the fourth quarter and so by the time we get out of this year we should be pretty close to the run rate as we jump off into steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the run rate right darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay got it thanks a lot operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren how are you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning gerard how are you doing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you the question i have has to do with i think you said that you were able to see some of your criticized loans taken off your balance sheet from competitors i was wondering if you can elaborate im not going to ask the names of who did this but could you elaborate the underwriting standards that you were holding these customers to that made it more enticing for them to go to another competitor assuming they got better terms and conditions and do you see that continuing in the second or third quarter of this year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah weve seen a as we mentioned fairly substantial amount of payoff activity this quarter a bunch of it was in and around new york city real estate and in many cases in the leisure and hospitality industry aka hotel and its a variety of players gerard that are coming in sometimes its private equity sometimes its the funds we have seen a couple refinanced by other banks and it might not necessarily be the credit per se and what i mean by that is when youve got a company on your books and youve been watching their performance over time and you downgrade them you want to see a few quarters of reperformance before you upgrade them and they get classified as a troubled debt restructuring potentially depending on what happens mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 and someone who comes in new its not a trouble its not a tdr for them its a new loan they can structure it the way they want in some cases we saw us get refinanced out and then additional dollars were added and so its a new loan and someone else resides and so the treatment from an accounting and a capital perspective is a little bit different and theyre not waiting for a little bit longer history of performance before they regrade it and change it right they might look more prospectively than we might typically look where youre wanting to see a few months maybe even a couple quarters of sustained performance before you change the grade and so for those reasons thats why you tend to see this stuff i think and i would humbly say that a lot of times people look at our underwriting and know our history of it and so are willing to take us out because they know these credits are strong and a lot of times that proves out when you look at the chargeoffs this quarter at basis points the reason that was so strong was as much because of recoveries because of the things that we had previously charged off where it turned out that the collateral values where we thought they would be and we were able to recover what we had previously charged off and so theres a number of things that happened when others take us out and its not something that we necessarily love but its part of the cycle gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good in view of the time ill just leave it at one question thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp okay operator and next question comes from john pancari from evercore john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning thanks for taking my question just one for me on the credit i mean on the commercial real estate front i know you indicated that the book should be relatively flat here going forward can you just maybe talk about what gives you confidence in that front i know you mentioned that paydowns were impacting the balances for the first quarter unless you have the amount of those paydowns and that gives you confidence that they could abate and then lastly do you expect any of the particular securitization that you mentioned of the peoples permanent financing portfolio to come into play here thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so i think theres a couple things that are behind that john over time when we look at our portfolio we tend to see growth in our portfolio when theres activity in the market and there hasnt been as much activity until recently with properties starting to change hands and so part of what we were just talking about about some of the paydowns is property starting to change hands and so that typically is a benefit for us the other thing is when we look at some of the payoffs and we mentioned that many were in our nonaccrual or criticized space and in the hotel part of our portfolio weve seen a number of upgrades and we continue to expect more upgrades to come because we are seeing a definite improvement in that portfolio and so for those reasons we expect to see a little bit less payoff and paydown activity there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 i mentioned a little bit about the construction loans and those paying off in a lot of cases what youre seeing is some folks trying to lock in where they could a fixed rate rather than the construction line is a variable rate and so people are trying to lock in some of the financing in the face of rising rates which of course can still happen but loans have to be at a certain place along the way meaning the construction loans have to be far enough along that you can convert some of it into permanent and then i guess the other part of it is just the utilization rate of those lines and where they stand as the projects near completion theyll continue to grow towards and when we look at where that utilization is today its higher than its been since well in our history that im looking at but certainly from the low point in december of and so when you open up a bunch of construction lines and the projects start to move forward you see those lines slowly build and grow and from a low of maybe 50oddpercent in were now in the call it to range and so at that point the constructions got to go to completion for the developer to get paid out and so those lines will continue to grow which will be a bit of an offset and so for a bunch of those reasons thats why when we look forward we think that there will be enough growth to offset some of the paydowns that are natural and expected and the other thing which we shouldnt discount from just loan growth in general is now that theres certainty around the deal and the merger that anxiety goes away for our employees and for our customers who are waiting and i think that thats a we shouldnt discount that that does have an impact on the psyche and as folks feel that certainty and understand the credit window that well start to see the activity ramp up and so thats also part of that forecast john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and anything on the potential securitization of the permanent financing book at peoples darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp its too early john to go through that i mean we still we talked about it youre right we talked about it at the merger announcement and its something that we think is an opportunity we still see that as a great way to be able to provide capital for our clients and its something that well look at and more to come as we go through the second quarter and third quarter just give us a second to integrate these two banks and i promise well come back john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks darren operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi your line is open from piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co hi darren mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just a quick followup on asset sensitivity i recognize that deposit betas are going to start lower and trend higher at some point but just to simplify things i wondered if you had any updated thoughts with peoples in tow what a given bp hike should do for the nim at least at the beginning of the cycle darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah early on just to give an update on where we had been before we talked about standalone i think it was may be to basis points before combined with the change of the portfolio its a little bit higher we would estimate kind of to bps and on a combined basis basis points on a full year annualized basis that to bps we think equates to about million to million in incremental nii frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay ill leave it there thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp no problem operator and our next question comes from bill carcache from wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good afternoon darren thanks for taking my question darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc so how are you thinking about growing the securities portfolio versus putting on swaps from here and separately how are you thinking about what the level of liquidity you should view as excess right now against the backdrop of a more aggressive balance sheet run off the cycle darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 yeah its a great question its something that we spend a lot of time talking about as a management team and our treasurer and treasury team spends obviously all day every day thinking about it we have a long ways to go clearly before were liquidity constrained we mentioned we start the combined bank with billion in cash but as we think about the mix between how much we put in the securities portfolio and how we think about the hedges what we like about the hedges is its a nice offset obviously to the loan book but its capital friendly right and so if you think about what weve seen in the last quarter if you try to cover asset sensitivity and reduce it solely through the securities portfolio and fixed rate product to the extent thats held and available for sale then you have equity risk as rates continue to rise whereas when we do it through the hedging its more equity efficient what we recognize though is that just given some of the changes that are happening between libor and sofr on the rate that loans are coming on the books and the changes to move the position down we wont be able to do it solely with hedging and so thats when we start to look at some of the other instruments and we look at and make a tradeoff decision between mortgagebacked securities versus just the mortgages that we can hold on our balance sheet when we look at the flow that we think is coming today out of our retail production we think that provides us a nice opportunity to manage down some of that asset sensitivity and deploy that liquidity and then when we think about securities for the rest and i think well continue for now to focus at the shorter end of the curve there just because weve got some of the longer part covered in the mortgage book and the thing that we always just kind of keep an eye on is whats happening in that deposit book and really thats the trick right as you look at whats happening with those deposit balances they look pretty sticky based on what we see right now but well want to hold a certain amount of liquidity and cash just for part of our liquidity coverage and liquidity management under stress but go at a pace where if youve got the excess you can always deploy it but if you find yourself short thats a little bit of a problem so wed rather kind of work our way down slowly to take that away and ultimately as we mentioned before get to a position where that securities plus mortgage balances as a percentage of the total balance sheet is kind of in the range of the top end of the bottom quartile of the peers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood very helpful thank you operator and our next question comes from indiscernible your line is open q thanks i think this is pretty clear but it looks like net interest income is going to go up by hundreds of millions of dollars in subsequent quarters am i missing something darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thats how we see it but the caveat of course is the fed curve actually has to come through so far weve got basis points but mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 q whats the final share count because i need to make sure i understand this straight darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp post deal its in the million million range q i used million darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp million million million shares q thank you very much congratulations you guys well done darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah q cheers darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thank you thank you operator and our last question comes from christopher spahr from wells fargo your line is open christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks for squeezing me in im just wondering what you think the organic growth rate for the portfolio more specifically the loan book will be in thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah were still going through and doing the work there i dont have any reason to believe that it will go much below the kind of to rate that weve been seeing or expect this year i mean this year is a little bit high mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 because we had some runoff and this pause that we talked about while there was uncertainty but in general its hard to outgrow gdp gdp might be a little bit high but were expecting that that will start to come down when i think about the puts and takes cre is probably going to stay a little bit lower as we talk about and complete the portfolio repositioning that weve talked about for a while ci we think weve seen some really strong growth already this year and expect that to continue theres clearly a question about the pace of recovery in the floor plan business when you look at a lot of the growth it was early in the quarter late in the year and at the end of the quarter you started to see a little bit of a slowdown in production and supply chains and so if that gets resolved you could see a higher growth rate in ci without it it might not be quite as robust and obviously that spills over into the indirect consumer refi and then mortgages i think mortgage activity will be a function obviously of how high the third year goes than whats happening with people changing homes which has been when we look around many of our geographies the biggest issue seems to be just availability of homes to buy versus desire to actually purchase at least right now well see whether that shift as i mentioned when rates go up but i would be thinking as a starting point in that to range for the whole portfolio christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator and it appears we have no more questions at this time i will now turn the program back over to
