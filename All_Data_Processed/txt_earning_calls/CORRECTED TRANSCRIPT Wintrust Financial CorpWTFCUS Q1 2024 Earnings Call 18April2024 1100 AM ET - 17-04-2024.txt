press release and in the companys most recent s and as tim mentioned earlier theyve had net recoveries for a few years a very conservative and wellrun credit function i wouldnt expect much from that and you could tell that just from looking at their public disclosures jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay and then you had highlighted the excess funding coming from the deal if we do see accelerated loan growth from the core bank would you look at adding wholesale funding as a shortterm fix until those excess funds come on or should we really be thinking that youre going to match fund all loan growth with full market price deposits david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we sometimes use wholesale funding to fund the growth because you can never match it perfectly right but our plan long term is even if you backfill in the short term with wholesale funding and we continue to grow our core consumer and commercial funding in a manner that you dont have to rely on the wholesale funding long wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 term but sometimes you have to backfill in if the loan growth is much more accelerated than your standard deposit gathering activities but its not a longterm plan its a shortterm gap to our plan jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah okay great thanks and then just finally for me you talked about the better spread opportunity on commercial lending where are you seeing spot rates for new ci loans now in the market richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp its a pretty broad group i mean for really high quality wellsecured wellstructured opportunities where youre getting a lot of treasury you could be in the range but were still seeing rates that are still very attractive and north of that and smaller deals and deals where there is a little bit more structural issues but generally speaking our job as we talked about is really bringing these customers in because you dont get these opportunities very often so our bankers are incredibly eager to win these opportunities when theyre out there im not saying that were going to be the lowest priced necessarily but were certainly if its a deal that we want were going to work hard to win it jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you
