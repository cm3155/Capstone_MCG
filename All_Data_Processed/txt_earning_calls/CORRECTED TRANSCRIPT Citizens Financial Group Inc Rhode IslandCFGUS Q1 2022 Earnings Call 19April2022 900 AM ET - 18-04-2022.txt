thanks kristin good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today there clearly have been changes in the external environment relative to what was expected coming into the year along with significant volatility we feel weve executed well in this environment and are positioned to perform well over the course of among the highlights of the quarter we had a successful conversion of the hsbc branch and online customers which was then followed by closing the investors acquisition on april we continue to take actions to position our balance well for rising rates and weve made further progress on our strategic initiatives including our digital agenda and top program with respect to our financial results we are off to a good start with underlying eps of and rotce of this is generally our softest quarter from a seasonal standpoint given fewer days in the quarter and the impact of payroll taxes on expenses net interest income was up sequentially given average loan growth and higher nim which more than offset a sizable drag from lower ppp loan forgiveness revenue and day count we saw lower revenue in capital markets and mortgages given the environment so high volatility benefited our global markets hedging business we maintain strong deal pipelines in capital markets and remain optimistic for a significant revenue pickup if markets stabilize we managed the expenses well in the quarter and turnover has normalized somewhat credit citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 metrics are all excellent and so far both our consumer and corporate customers are navigating well through the current challenges our balance sheet remains in great shape with a cet1 ratio of we have the capacity to grow loans pursue feebased bolton acquisitions raise our dividend in the second half of the year and buy back some stock our loan growth has picked up on the commercial side and we plan to throttle back our growth in mortgage and auto which will maintain an attractive ldr id like to shift gears to emphasize a few key points that are topical for investors at the moment first and to be clear we will benefit nicely from the accelerated path to higher rates our funding base is vastly improved from where it was entering the last rate upcycle we had a benefit from a basis point gradual rise in rates a basis point cost of interestbearing deposits and loantodeposit ratio we project roughly million in higher nii given the current curve which annualizes to much more in this will more than offset roughly million in lower fee income from the environment john will take you through this in detail in his remarks second while inflation pressures are real and the possibility of recession in has increased we feel our credit risk position is in very good shape we have maintained a super prime to high prime risk appetite in consumer and over time we have migrated our credit exposure in commercial to bigger companies who have better credit profiles as a result our overall credit profile has improved over time our reallife and ccar stress test results demonstrate that our credit profile is slightly better than middle of the superregional pack and we have carefully assessed investors credit book and loss history and remain confident in their positioning which we will further harmonize over time lastly with respect to acquisitions i would like to highlight that our focus in is on integrating the acquisitions that we made last year and getting each of those off to a strong start particularly our new york city metro area initiative we will still look for acquisitions in the wealth space but we are a highly disciplined acquirer and have not been able to get much done as a result with respect to florida we now have eight branches in the state and job one is bringing them to network performance levels there does not appear to be much to do thats attractive inorganically and the likely path is that we will open several more wealth centers in additional cities down the road in short you can count on us to maintain the strong financial discipline weve exhibited since the ipo all in all we feel very good about how weve started the year and how we are positioned to navigate the challenging environment given the significant move in rates and the closing of the two bank acquisitions weve provided detailed guidance in our earnings presentation to assist analysts and investors in updating their models we continue our journey to building a great bank that can do ever more for our stakeholders and with that ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great thanks bruce good morning everyone first ill start with our headlines for the quarter we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit net interest income was up linked quarter driven by stronger loan growth and a basis point improvement in margin periodend loan growth was up a solid linked quarter our retail loans are up about while commercial loans are up or ex ppp impacts average loans are up linked quarter paced by commercial up or ex ppp and retail up citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 fees were down linked quarter driven primarily by lower capital market fees of a record prior quarter given market volatility seasonal impacts and some pull forward of transactions into the fourth quarter on a positive note we had our best quarter ever in interest rate and commodities revenues as we helped clients manage through the volatile environment we remain disciplined on expenses which were up sequentially excluding acquisitions reflecting seasonal payroll tax impacts yearoveryear expenses were up a modest excluding acquisitions we recorded an underlying credit provision benefit of million which reflects strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios the nearterm macroeconomic outlook remains positive though we are monitoring whether fed actions to slow inflation can do so while engineering a soft landing for the economy the underlying credit benefit for the quarter excludes million for the double count of day one cecl provision expense tied to the hsbc transaction our acl ratio stands at down slightly from at the end of and the day one cecl level our tangible book value per share was down linked quarter driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedge valuations that impact aoci we continue to have a very strong capital position with cet1 at after a basis point impact from the hsbc transaction next ill provide some key takeaways for the first quarter while referring to the presentation slides net interest income on slide was up given strong loan growth and the benefit of higher rates more than offsetting the approximately million combined impact from the lower day count and the reduced benefit from ppp forgiveness the net interest margin was up basis points reflecting the benefit of higher rates with front book yields rising which more than offset reduced ppp benefit margin is also benefiting from lower cash balances as we continue to redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth of note ppp spot loans were down to roughly million at quarterend and forgiveness benefits headwinds are substantially behind us we made continued progress lowering our interestbearing deposit costs which are now basis points an alltime low down basis points linked quarter moving to slide given the feds recent rate hike and the expectation for fed funds rate to end the year in the basis points to basis points range we thought it would be helpful to discuss why we are confident that we will realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out we entered this race cycle with a much higher level of asset sensitivity at before the first rate hike in march this is already starting to benefit nii in the first quarter and is driving a significant improvement in our full year outlook and those benefits will continue to accumulate into importantly our expected asset sensitivity reflects how we have completely transformed our funding base since the ipo we are beginning the current upcycle with a very strong liquidity profile our ldr is much lower our deposit costs are as low as theyve ever been and our overall funding profile has greatly improved our periodend demand deposits sits are our of the book compared with at the beginning of the last rate cycle and within our interestbearing deposits our consumer cds are now less than of total deposits compared with about at the start of the last cycle we are also starting this cycle with a much lower level of floating wholesale funding this improved deposit profile reflects the significant improvements weve made to our deposit franchise since the ipo with improved and expanded retail and commercial deposit offerings we have also enhanced data analytics that allow us to attract and retain more stable deposits citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 with a better starting position and the improvements in our deposit mix and capabilities we expect our interest bearing beta to be about over this rate cycle which is meaningfully lower than the last cycle our overall asset sensitivity stands at at the end of the first quarter this is down modestly from at the end of with the decrease primarily driven by the denominator impacts of our higher nii outlook given the benefits from the april forward curve and the evolution of the balance sheet pro forma for the investors acquisition asset sensitivity is slightly over since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain on the bottom left side of this page weve given you an estimate of our sensitivity to further changes in rates either up or down from the forward curve potentially a basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about million to million a quarter with most of that coming from our exposure to the short end of the curve this includes the pro forma impact of investors moving on to slide we delivered good fee results this quarter despite headwinds for capital markets demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses and we drove solid performance across other fee categories capital markets delivered solid results despite the market volatility seasonal impacts and some pull forward into the full fourth quarter of given the strength of our pipelines capital markets fees could rebound nicely as markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy demonstrating the diversity of our business we delivered our best quarterly results ever in global markets up quarter linked quarter as we work with clients to manage their foreign exchange interest rate and commodity exposures mortgage fees were down linked quarter against the backdrop of lower industry origination volumes given rising rates and seasonal impacts strong competition and excess industry capacity continued to pressure margins mortgage servicing income improved as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the msr card fees and service charges and fees were slightly lower linked quarter given seasonality debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed prepandemic levels and wealth fees also remained strong on slide expenses were well controlled up linked quarter and just yearonyear excluding acquisitions our top efficiency program is well underway targeting million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year periodend loans on slide were up linked quarter we were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth again this quarter up or ex ppp average loans were up linked quarter driving this was average commercial loan growth of or ex ppp impacts led by ci with growth across almost every region including our expansion markets average retail growth was also line utilization began to rebound a bit with an increase of about basis points to a little over on a spot basis primarily driven by corporate banking led by manufacturing and trade as companies look to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and facilitate some ma activity on slide our periodend deposits were up linked quarter as we added billion of lower cost deposits with the hsbc transaction excluding hsbc periodend and average deposits were down slightly given seasonal impacts as well as continued normalization from elevated liquidity levels moving on to credit on slide we saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios net chargeoffs were up slightly at basis points for the first quarter with good performance across the portfolio nonperforming loans increased by million linked quarter primarily driven by residential real estate secured loans exiting forbearance citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 other credit metrics continue to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans were lower while we are mindful of inflationary pressures and the higher possibility of recession we feel good about the improvements to the portfolio weve made over the last few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk in the event on slide youll see that the risk profile of our commercial portfolio has significantly improved given changes through the pandemic including prudent lending and a focus on growing the bigger midcorporate credit portfolio which is higher rated as well as reductions in stressed sectors such as retail malls education and casual dining on the retail side we continue to focus on the super prime and prime segment our risk profile has improved given our disciplined risk appetite and changes in our portfolio mix including the runoff of our personal and secured product of note investors portfolios have performed well in prior cycles and we feel good about them moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio remained strong at at the end of the first quarter after closing the hsbc transaction which had a 20basispoint impact we also wanted to mention that we have widened our target cet1 operating range to to from to reflective of the continued progress weve made in improving profitability revenue diversity and overall risk management our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company shifting gears a bit on slide youll see some examples of the progress weve made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make citizens a great place to work as you know we closed the acquisition of investors at the beginning of april further expanding the foothold we established in the new york city metro area through the hsbc branch transaction and significantly advancing our growth plans in the consumer business we were excited to complete the upgrade of citizens access to a fully cloudenabled core platform which enhances the capabilities of our national digital bank and is the first step toward our multiyear objective of convergence with our core banking platforms we also recently announced citizens evervalue checking a new overdraftfree checking account designed to meet bank on national account standards and increase banking access for underserved communities on the commercial side we continue to perform well in the league tables consistently ranking in the top as a middle market and sponsor bookrunner on the right side of the page weve included some digital metrics we are very excited with how our digitalfirst approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction given the significant change in the rate environment and the closing of our two bank acquisitions we provided a comprehensive update to our guidance on slide the good news here is that our guide is up in our standalone business rates are helping nii more than offsetting the fact that we are down a little on fees so ppnr is higher and there is no change in our positive view on credit and we remain confident in the outlook for the bank deals ill focus my comments on the full year outlook including both hsbc and investors but weve also added the standalone outlook without the bank deals to help isolate performance we have also included a comparison to our original guide from january to help highlight what is driving the overall improvement in the full year outlook the rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of april which implies a fed funds target of basis points to basis points by the end of the year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 on the long end this rate curve implies the 10year treasury to be above basis points at the end of the year it is also useful to keep in mind that the cumulative benefit from rates would also represent meaningful full year effect upside to nii in for we expect nii to be up to driven primarily by the improved rate environment and solid average loan growth of to on a standalone basis nii is about million to million better than our prior guidance given the higher rates average interest earning assets are expected to be up to fee income is expected to be up to on a standalone basis fee revenue will be about million lower than the january guide as the environment will impact mortgage revenue as well as capital markets somewhat noninterest expense is expected to be up to given the full year effect of hsbc and investors as well as our commercial feebased acquisitions credit is expected to remain excellent with net chargeoffs broadly stable to down slightly for the year and we expect to end the year with a cet1 ratio of about which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividend in the second half of the year our capital projections include the impact of our expected notable items for the year including the integration expenses for the acquisitions and our top costs you can see those in the appendix on slide importantly we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately on an underlying basis for the year excluding the acquisitions and if you set aside the impact of ppp that would be over operating leverage including acquisitions we expect operating leverage of over and over excluding ppp overall we expect our full year rotce to land solidly within our to mediumterm target range moving to side ill walk through the outlook for the second quarter on a standalone basis we expect nii to be up to driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth with the bank acquisitions we expect nii to be up to on a standalone basis average loans are expected to be up to led by commercial with interestearning assets up slightly fees are expected to be up to on a standalone basis reflecting some improvement in capital markets and seasonal benefits including the acquisitions fees are expected to be up to noninterest expense on a standalone basis is expected to be up to given higher revenuebased compensation including the acquisitions expenses are expected to be up to net chargeoffs are expected to be broadly stable and we expect our cet1 ratio to land at around to sum up with slide and we started with a solid quarter we have a winning strategy and are well positioned to succeed given the strength and diversity of our businesses we are very optimistic about the outlook for the rest of and beyond we expect to materially benefit from a higher rate environment and strong loan growth our capital markets business is well positioned as markets stabilize and we are very excited about the opportunity to grow our business in the new york metro region as we integrate and build on hsbc and investors we will continue to focus on execution in building a topperforming bank that delivers for all our stakeholders with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 okay thank you john operator lets open it up for some qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i was hoping maybe you could spend just a moment discussing sort of the magnitude of recovery youre assuming in the capital markets environment in the forward guide it looks like you assume some recovery in the second quarter but of course moderated the full year target a bit just curious for some thoughts or color on how you see things trajecting from here john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start off on that i mean i think you had a number of impacts there that were building into the guide id say that we mentioned our million guide over guide which is driven primarily by mortgage but theres some capital markets implications there as well given the fact that we have some pull forward into the fourth quarter if you look back at the fourth quarter we had a record quarter but our pipelines look excellent and so there could be a little bit of time to build that back into delivering in the last three quarters of the year but as markets stabilize we really think that the momentum there is strong and so maybe don can cover donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think its a tale of a couple of different cities so one thing were seeing is quite a bit of strength in the loan markets the syndicated loan markets so while the bond markets are particularly high yield and the equity markets have been pretty much closed for the last few months were seeing some rotation into the syndicated loan markets as liquidity there kind of rebuild and youve seen quite a dramatic rally in the loan markets over the last couple of days actually and thats been quite supportive so i think the second quarter will be really a story about syndicated lending and then if we get a reduction in volatility we think were going to begin to see the bond markets reopen a little bit and the equity markets reopen i will say what john said which is our pitch activity our pipelines and are mandates are extremely strong and so its really a matter of waiting for the constructiveness in the markets to return and then well begin to bring deals and we saw three or four deals start to emerge last week which we were on and we feel pretty good about particularly the back half of the year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the other thing you didnt mention is the ma pipeline which i think still looks really really good and again there if the markets stabilize a little bit i think well start to pull those deals through and its typically seasonal but the fourth quarter is huge which it was for us in and then the first quarter is usually softer seasonally pipelines look good and i think as the year goes we should see a nice build in ma revenue donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill also just amplify that bruce to say a lot of our capital markets and ma activity surrounds private equity so private equity is still flush with cash and they actually are looking at quite interesting valuations in the market right now so its a matter of matching sellers kind of desires and buyers desires and that will just take a little time to kind of work through the system bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah good r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful thats good color thank you and then john i was hoping you could talk just a bit about how your rate sensitivity changes as the cycle progresses meaning effectively how do the first few rate hikes look in your mind versus the next several john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so did you say asset sensitivity or was it fed i missed it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co in other words how much more powerful are the first few rate hikes than the next few john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean id say that the we mentioned our million to million per instantaneous basis points rate hike and thats really an average so you get a little more on the front and maybe a little less as you get to the end of it and thats really driven by deposit betas which are going to be extremely well controlled in the first and then that starts to build into the second and then beyond so yeah i think you will see possibly a bit more on the front end when were seeing those that lag effect in deposit betas contribute a touch more and then a little and then it will be a little lower on the back end i will mention this the other point that million to million is an average but its also a first year average and so theres actually more upside when you get into even if its instantaneous you still get a lag effect benefit from the asset side as well as assets reprice so you might see for example in year two even for an instantaneous basis point change you would see upside from there in the to range on top of that as you getting to roll in year two citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you so much for a slide and i guess john maybe let me start my line of questioning here so your current asset sensitivity from here is percent pro forma for investors i guess i want to understand the comment that bruce made earlier about acceleration right so on one hand we do expect deposit betas to accelerate as we are deeper into the rate cycle but on the other hand you have some swaps on your portfolio today can you talk a bit about the interplay of both and how should we think of this asset sensitivity as we move forward in the rate cycle and does the swap portfolio give you a different trajectory for enhanced sensitivity later john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks erika i think if youre on page i mean i think that the drivers there are that were entering this cycle but much better positioned than the last cycle when you think about just the starting point with interest bearing deposit costs being at basis points an alltime low for us we started the last cycle at basis points and a balance sheet position the mix on the deposit side is much better with noninterest bearing so we feel just much better prepared to benefit from rising rates this time around we still benefited from rising rates last time around by the way but were much better prepared to benefit from this side around this time around on deposit betas given all the strength on the balance sheet i think when you ask about balance sheet i mean i think and swaps you really have to think about in the context of the entire balance sheet so we do have a significant amount of asset sensitivity left to play out that will decline over time as nii keeps rising as i mentioned in my remarks the denominator effect as we as we update and increase our nii that alone reduces the percentage further benefit that could occur for future rate hikes just dollar for dollar is fine but the percentages fall but i do think that there is significant firepower left both with respect to the balance sheet loan growth part of the story as well as much more hedging left to do before asset sensitivity gets anywhere near neutral so thats how i would describe it i mean in terms of deposit betas again youre going to see a lot of lag a lot of lag in the first it will start to catch up maybe in the second and then if we really do get to basis points in fed funds youll see some of that catch up in and then ill just close out with our conversation about nii being up million to million guide over guide is an important thing to focus on and thats on a gradual rate rising scenario it may be it could be its much higher in a full year effect when you get to approaching maybe that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would just add erika that weve been i think very keen to leave the asset sensitivity high and not do significant additional swaps weve done a bit but anyway were still i think of the view that rates could go even higher here so feel good about how were positioned right now citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and the second question is for you bruce the stock is having a good start to the day but the valuation on tangible book value is underneath your rotce landing point for the year either on a standalone or a pro forma basis i guess what do you think in your estimation that the market doesnt understand about the improvements that the bank has made since the ipo and wondering i think part of that is the asset sensitivity and deposits wondering if you could answer that question the way however where you want to but also could you give us a sense of how much checking accounts you have for example on the consumer side versus previous and maybe remind us why you have to keep what seems like a basis point to basis point higher capital level than a lot of your regional peers bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah theres a lot in that ill try to unpack that erika but i think partly the our objective here is to continue to perform well through cycles and so were a relatively new company with a relatively fresh management team and so i think when the market goes into a riskoff posture some assumptions of how are they going to do were not as we dont have the historical track record of some of our peers i think i think weve done a good job of dispelling some of those worry beads when we went through the pandemic and our credit performance was very good i think there was some concern for a while that weve grown the balance sheet fairly quickly to get releveraged after the ipo and was that going to end in tears and weve said all along that weve been very disciplined in terms of where we were lending money and how we were allocating capital and i think thats borne fruit i think now with an upcycle at the beginning of the year when the environment looked like rates were going to go up gradually to use a goldilocks example that was the porridge was just right scenario and so our stock performed quite well out of the chute i think once it became clear that the fed was behind the curve and was going to start to raise rates much more aggressively i think then you kind of tipped into well maybe the porridge is too hot and will our deposit betas go up too fast and curtail some of the benefits from higher rates and i think again with all the work weve done and analysis weve provided were quite confident that the liability side of this bank is much much better than its ever been weve done a lot of hard work on that and so we still think whether the path is fast or whether its more gradual were going to benefit significantly in terms of interest rates id say also on fees theres probably a concern that weve built up some areas that maybe are more volatile in capital markets and mortgage is kind of a big fee element for us having said that i think youve seen that theres good diversity in our fees and so in a pandemic period when capital markets were a bit softer mortgage revenues were really really strong given lower rates and we can see that flip around but i think the fact that weve assembled an excellent commercial bank with very strong capabilities and a targeted focus on private capital and serving private capital and helping the industries that are really are the engine of the economy technology healthcare with our jmp acquisition i think were very confident that we can grow revenues sustainably and capital markets theyll move around a little bit from quarter to quarter but i think the trend line is upwards and to the right and again on the mortgage business i think weve built that out to have a nice diversity of revenues across wholesale channels and our retail channel i think we can combat some of the lower production volumes by building market share so we plan to hire more fellows this year so i think all of these aspects take time for the market to come around and fully appreciate and well just keep doing what were doing and putting up good results and executing well and then i think ultimately the stock will take care of itself citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 with respect to the noninterest bearing liabilities i mean the ddas as a percentage of the total deposit base is up to about i think when i walked in the door at the time of the ipo that was probably in the low so thats been a dramatic improvement focusing on total value proposition to certain target customer segments on the consumer side and then also on the commercial side actually just building out our capabilities and investing in our core platform and cash management offering and so its just been a gradual improvement over time as weve enhanced our capabilities and our targeting and weve had nice growth as a result so i think ill stop there does anybody want to add to that brendan do you want to talk about consumer deposits or don on commercials brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah im happy to give a erika you asked about sort of accounts of checking account customers just a couple of quick points when you look at total relationships in the consumer bank when we went public we had about million to million customers we now have over million customers in total now some of those are loan customers so when you unpack that to core deposit customers that number is sort of we went from million to million customers so thats good growth but thats really not where the action is in the story versus sort of heading down this path really under the covers on that growth which weve been in sort of top quartile growth of our peers has been a quality transformation so there has been a dramatic overhaul in how many customers view us as their primary bank and more than of the growth in the household base has come from mass affluent and affluent customers so when you combine the higher quality customer with deeper relationships thats whats driving a lot of the improvement in dda and noninterest bearing deposits which is very sustainable thats kind of ground game a lot of work over multiple quarters over a lot of years to get that to scale and look we still have some running room i think theres still oxygen left in that tank for us to continue to improve the quality of the customer base weve made a lot of progress in catching up to peers but we still have momentum it does not seem to be slowing i think you should expect more and more of that putting aside what happens with the excess stimulus deposits i think under the coverage the quality story is still continuing and continuing at scale the other point id make mentioned of as you think about betas for this upcycle last time because of the low dda balances that we had in consumer we had about billion in cds now we start that period with only billion and we look a lot more like a bigger sized bank in terms of deposit composition than we do a smaller size bank where were not as rate sensitive in how were driving deposit because of that quality transformation that you see in the customer base donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just emphasize bruce what you said in terms of weve gone through a complete reconstruction of our treasury service business it was frankly a basket case six years ago and now i would put it up against any other companies treasury service business and thats driving an above trend growth rate to in terms of year onyear growth and also driving a skew towards noninterest bearing deposits and we didnt even have a deposit team six years ago and now we have a builtout team which has got fantastic analytics bringing new offerings like green deposits on the esg agenda and also building a liquidity portal so its in a totally different place and were seeing results in terms of deposit levels and were seeing the skew towards noninterest bearing also citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so were giving you a longwinded answer erika but i wanted to just come back to the last thing you touched on which was rotce and also our capital targets so i think were pleased that we can say that will be solidly in the range for our mediumterm targets this year of the to and you can see that where we were in the first quarter that should ramp and so we could be even stronger i think as we exit the year so we feel very good about that we did move the targets from to to to so we moved them modestly im still a big believer in being somewhat conservative on the capital particularly as i said were a relatively new company and so i think all our stakeholders take some comfort from maybe being slightly higher than our peers but if you look at it over time weve been converging to peers and honestly when you look at the ccar results and our risk profile theres no reason that longer term well need to have that premium erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for the complete answer bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator thank you your next question comes from the line of brian foran with autonomous your line is now open brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hey good morning maybe to follow up on deposits youve been very clear and convincing on the improvement in the books so thats appreciated and great information as you think also about the ability to grow deposits over the next two years i wonder i know theres a lot of moving parts theres no one answer but if you could just give your thoughts on the ability to grow deposits overall and maybe touch on consumer versus commercial and how that might behave as rates go up john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah great question brian appreciate it i think that you basically look at excellent opportunities to grow deposits over time as our product lineup on both consumer and commercial have improved and i think if you separate the expectation for as rates rise theres some impact on how those deposits play out and theres also the surge deposits that came in in the pandemic that all appear to be a lot stickier than maybe a lot of us thought when they first showed up i do think more broadly when you think about the macro deposits have grown consistently over the last several decades under a number of different macroeconomic scenarios even through quantitative tightening and the like the banking industry deposit growth seems to continue to chug along so were optimistic that the industry as a whole and we in particular given our significantly expanded product capabilities well be able to continue to drive really strong deposit growth on both consumer and commercial side so maybe ill just turn it over to brendan and then maybe don citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah look i think weve demonstrated in a variety of cycles the ability to drive deposits at scale the question is always at what cost and i think were in a dramatically different position in this upcycle than we were certainly in the last upcycle we continue to make improvements sort of on the consumer side starting with just the breadth of the levers that weve built whether its the citizens access platform nationally to raise deposits away from our core book the new markets that were entering where weve got a solid and stable deposit base but we think theres a lot of running room in fact were starting to see early signs already of weve got million in inflow of balance sales already in the new york market from great execution and solid sales so were optimistic continuing and going forward that can continue and as we bring and convert the customer base from investors closely as they went into the platform we think that same opportunity will exist in new jersey and then our analytics have improved materially over the last couple years which allows us to be even more targeted and when you marry that with what i said a minute ago around just the quality and engagement of our customer base the confidence of being able to grow deposits with highly engaged customers at more market rates than needing to reach for promo rates is high so i feel really good that well be able to grow at the pace we need with a much more moderate cost donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just i think i said a lot of it in the last comment around treasury services and the growth of that business but also remember were expanding aggressively in terms of our client base so were in expansion markets were adding a lot of clients and with that comes the opportunity to gather deposits at reasonable costs so we feel pretty good about it but ill go back to what brendan said also its really a matter of the daytoday balancing of volume versus cost and managing that against the asset side of the balance sheet and where we can redeploy capital so its something that we managed carefully but i feel confident that were going to continue to expand the deposit base brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp i appreciate all that i will say im a citizens access customer im not loving the renewed beta assumptions youre making but i guess ill have to live with it brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island well you can count on us continuing to be disciplined yet still competitive though brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you very much i appreciate it bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 okay operator thank you your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one was just on the most recent conversation that we had on deposit growth i was intrigued by that relative to bruce your comment about flowing resi and auto lending growth to i dont know if this is the right word but keep the ldr protect the ldr at around the level so i guess i just wanted to understand if that comment about ldr was more about the deposit growth rate that you were talking to just now or was that because of the just opportunities in resi and auto that youre not seeing as much as maybe you have had over the past few quarters bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say its a kind of a factor of a number of considerations one is that were already seeing very strong loan demand on the commercial side were seeing line utilization tick up so there can be somewhat of a rotation over into more growth on commercial therefore when we look at consumer and in that higher rate environment some of the margins on the lending in areas like auto and mortgage arent what they used to be and so we can still get to the loan growth assumptions that we had coming into the year with that rotation up to more commercial and throttling back a little bit on the consumer side and we could keep the pedal to the floor and keep pushing on bringing in those consumer assets but we think we dont need to do that at this point weve got nim going up the rate hikes is providing a big lift and if the marginal return on that incremental lending in the consumer side for mortgage and auto isnt hitting our hurdles then we have no problem backing off that the net result of that is that benefits the ldr versus keeping the pedal to the floor so we think thats a tradeoff worth taking betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just your i guess the underlying question is how high up are you willing for ldr to go and then i also had just a quick question just on yields in general this past quarter you had some nice uplift in resi and the securities book other retail loans and im just wondering was that a function of swap activity that drove up those yields qq or was there it didnt look like the balances would have driven that qq so just wondering how do you approach whats there thanks citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island let me start off and then maybe john and brendan can add on the yield question but weve been historically since the ipo weve had a relatively higher ldr that we worked hard to bring down from the high down into the mid and then with this big influx of liquidity into the market weve been able to bring the ldr back down to 80ish and its inching up a little bit here with all the loan growth that were experiencing i think we should still be able to manage that in the i cant really call exactly where that is likely to be partly depends on the amount of loan growth that we see but i think just the way we over time brought it from high down into mid and i think we can take another step function here with all the liquidity that we have in the house and continue to manage that in a reasonably conservative position with lots of liquidity so that would be my answer there john maybe you want to pick up the yields john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start off on securities and maybe brendan can take mortgage but i can tell you overall that its not swamp activity thats having an impact on either of those and as it relates to securities just to give you a sense theres two dynamics going on there one is the front book where current yields on the stuff going into the portfolio are north of so were in the basis point to basis point range thats a driver in it wasnt at that level during but it was well over it was probably basis point to basis point during the first quarter and that was compared to maybe basis points in so thats the dynamic youre seeing basis points in 230ish basis points in and now its over so that will continue into the second quarter but the other dynamic is the back book premium amortization tends it declines when rates rise so youre seeing the tailwind from that into the securities book and so thats the driver there and maybe brendan can talk about mortgages brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah theres a handful of things on the consumer side so on other retail theres a good percentage of that book thats variable linked to the market with our merchant partners and such and you can see that kind of ramp up as the market changes on the resi side were obviously a very big lender in heloc which is essentially all variable and weve had four sequential quarters in a row in net balance sheet growth and i believe were the number one originator in all of the united states in helocs were really striking while the iron hot and taking advantage of that business so youre seeing that flow through in the resi book with the yield improvements there as the rates kind of march north on the mortgage side so a couple of things one is front book pricing weve been disciplined on front book pricing to the point of being a little out of the market at times as the market lags capacity but were going to make sure were using our balance sheet for deep relationships and try to push our rates up as fast as we can with the market the other just technical dynamic that youre seeing if youre looking at linked quarter on mortgages in q4 we did have a onetime reserve adjustment to the yields in q4 that is nonrecurring and didnt happen in q1 so if you look back a couple of quarters youll see a little bit of noise on what we saw in q4 but thats kind of gone thats sort of washed out so we should start to see the mortgage book begin to climb with the percentage of that book that isnt variable rate and continued expected discipline on front book pricing citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you guys could remind us with investors is there any portion of the loan book or securities book that youre looking to kind of deemphasize or run off john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just start off there i mean i think that the securities book at investors looks as a profile that we would migrate and frankly have already been migrating to our profile which is mostly clean duration plus mortgage backed securities agencytype paper so weve been in the process of migrating the securities book on that front in general we like the loan book that comes over from investors has performed well from a credit perspective they have a nice core portfolio over there maybe don could talk about anything else that might be migrated at the margin donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah there are certain elements of the book that might be a little bit different as we move forward but its not going to be quick and aggressive were going to do it were going to migrate it over time but a lot of the business that they do is very diversifying for us theyre in different elements of the cre business than we are so it looks quite different and then a lot of the ci businesses is smaller company business banking and were looking to grow that segment as we move forward so youll see some adjustment at the margin but no aggressive asset sales i think out of the blocks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island other than i will say matt on my side we are doing roughly billion to billion of dso adjustments on the citizens side and youll see us do some of that as we move around lowyielding assets that we might be acquiring but we dont have full plans on that yet donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah balance sheet optimization and stuff matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i guess obviously theres some opportunities as well to potentially crosssell but as we think about layering in investors to the kind of medium term do you think it will have any net impact as we think about your loan growth either a little bit less than citizen standalone or a little bit more or roughly the same citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well i mean i look at it as what don and brendan have been able to accomplish when we go into expansion markets right in particular dons business in commercial when we enter the southeast its a good playbook for how weve been able to grow those expansion markets a little faster for a period of time until it converges over time so i think you would expect that once we get the engine running with respect to all of the integration and conversion and weve been able to make our investments that we plan to make in new york metro i would suspect for a number of years you could see the growth rates once that all settles out and baselines you could see those growth rates actually being higher than citizens standalone for a number of years until it balances out in terms of the expected market share that we plan to take in that metro donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john ill also add that they have a very limited product set on the ci side so bringing in the variety of products that we can offer and capabilities that we can offer we think theres an opportunity to go after larger companies and also serve their clients in a much more substantial way brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah same comment on the consumer side our product set is significantly more diversified than both hsbc and investors which is great and we didnt build those revenue synergies into the deal model so were seeing early signs of significant sales opportunity in new york were delivering on that were starting marketing middle of the year were going to convert early on mortgage and wealth for investors inside of and then the rest of the platform will convert in so it will take some time but we see an outsized opportunity for sustainable revenue growth over time bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me just chime in here as well is that we think these deals are going to be a big success and its really not just the expense synergies which were going to go get but if its a big success it means that we were successful in crossselling more to the customers who havent had the benefit of our broader products and services and then just gain market share and i think we have some very clear ideas about how to go after that both on the commercial side and the consumer side and really none of that has been put into our forward forecasts at this point so our goal would be like within three to five years if new york starts to take on a look and feel of what we built in boston and what we built in philadelphia its going to be a home run for us matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning i had a question about reserving and provision so just looking back at where your acl is pre isbc and then just with all the cecl stuff going on just wanted to kind of understand where citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 do you think that the reserve lands visavis a blended day one and what does that mean for further release or provision growth relative to your expectation that you laid out four chargeoffs thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thats a good question i mean i think the first thing i would say when youre saying blended if you were speaking about investors on a blended basis i think that their profile is actually quite good and when you look back in different cycles their loss rates actually are lower than not only ours but the regional bank peer set and given the collateralization et cetera and a number of other things that help that profile so pound for pound they come on with a slightly lower acl and cecl hit to what a cfg standalone is its not by a lot and theyre smaller so it wont have a huge impact but they come in a little lower than call it the where we are so from that perspective it gives you a sense for how that might cause us to tick down on a blended basis cecl day one was were at weve cleaned out a lot of the portfolios of concern that might have existed back at the end of when cecl was adopted and theres been significant as we mentioned earlier and we have in the slide deck in the appendix significant improvements in both commercial and kind of retail businesses since then so you could see some opportunity all else equal for back book needs as long as the macro holds for those needs to tick down i think all of the variability will be on loan growth and so were just going to provide for our loan growth and allin probably be a little lower than we are here but not by a lot bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the other wildcard obviously ken is what does the kind of long term or the medium term macro forecast look like and can the fed engineer a soft landing if theres a higher possibility of recession which could change that dynamic somewhat but i think certainly right now with respect to we feel really good about our position from a credit standpoint and i would if you ask me to make a call id say its unlikely well have a recession in so at least the clean credit metrics should continue for a while whether we can still show net benefits on the provision line i think those days are probably numbered but in any case i think theres still going to be good numbers and as john said the acl may tick down a little more from here but were kind of starting to feel like were not going to go a huge amount lower ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and bruce as a followup to that it was good nice to see the commercial line utilization up basis points you talked about youre reiterating your full year loan growth guidance just wondering if you can give us some ontheground color about business activity supply chain constraints just in terms of and also the trade off possibly between loans going on the balance sheet versus out the door in capital markets and just kind of a feel for just how the commercial side of the economy is feeling and how that influences your views on commercial growth thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me just say a word and then don really has the best color but clearly its nice to see the line utilization pick up some of it is a little defensive in nature so people have been worried about their supply chain and inventory levels and so when they can get a hold of the materials that they need they go out and buy it so id say inventory build in light of supply chain issues probably has been the biggest driver and a little of that also is citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 inflation which is causing those materials to cost more so that would be id say number one theres still people doing deals doing smaller deals and playing offense in terms of growth theres a little bit of that ticking in as well i think what continues to give us confidence is the thing that don mentioned earlier that theres private capital has amassed tons of firepower to put to work in the markets and is looking to get deals done and so theres still deal related activity that should continue to fuel some loan growth but with that let me turn it over to don donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so i think you covered most of it and back to the second half of the question a lot of the capital markets activity we do is in the leveraged buyout area and things like that so thats an origination for distribution business which it should be we dont want a lot of that on our balance sheet and we continue to maintain average holds of about million in our sponsor business so very diversified very careful from a risk profile i will say that the utilization trend that were seeing is actually even a little bit higher as we sit here in midapril so that trend really is driven by cost of goods so theres an inflation aspect and some of the stockpiling but the broader question is were hearing generally positive things from our customers the credit quality as we said feels pretty good theres a little bit of pressure on margins as companies have varying degrees of inability to pass on cost increases where theyre seeing them but remember that these companies have been through hell over the last two years with the pandemic and theyve cut their costs theyve restructured their businesses and theyre entering whatever were entering whether it be a slowdown or something thats just slower growth in a much better position from a management standpoint that they were just two years ago so that gives us a lot of confidence and certain clients are being optimistic where theyre seeing as bruce said where theyre seeing competitors that are slightly weakened were seeing a little bit of ma activity in the middle market channels that companies are buying each other bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the one last thing you might also add don is on the subscription line financing and some of the securitization for private equity donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so were seeing significant volume in our subscription line financing for private equity and significant volume in our assetbacked securities businesses in the warehouses so those markets are very strong and we continue to see growth in the loan books on both of those activities ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for all color bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 operator thank you your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning i appreciate the color you gave there in terms of the commercial drivers and the trend behind the demand are you able to perhaps help unpack the highsingledigit loan growth expectation ex the deals and ex ppp for in terms of how you think about ci growth and perhaps growth in your cre portfolio as well thanks donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so why dont i start with that so were down to basically almost nothing on the ci side on ppp so thats in the rearview mirror so thats not in any of our loan growth projections the loan growth that weve referenced is really cfg loan growth weve assumed a little bit of growth on the investors bank side but not a lot for the rest of so all the comments were making are cfg specific i would say subscription lines are growing the fastest ci is growing the second fastest and cre were seeing very very modest growth and were basically on our cre business really still focused on purposebuilt office industrial and life science and a little bit on multifamily but not a lot were really offrisk on hospitality and retail so not a lot of cre business there the issue that were fighting and continue to fight although its getting a little bit better is our originations are really strong were seeing lots of activity both coming into the book and also in the pipelines but paydowns have been quite high and this was the first quarter where we saw paydowns begin to decline maybe thats a little bit of the volatility in the capital markets maybe thats a little bit of the loan market aggressiveness right now but were seeing a little bit of a benefit from lower paydowns which were running very very high last year for almost the whole year and really eating up a lot of the origination activity that were seeing john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thats helpful and then separately on the credit side just have a question there in terms of the increase in the npas and the increase in the 90day delinquencies i know you indicated thats mainly mortgage coming off forbearance just want to give you if you can give us a little color in terms of your confidence there in terms of the resolution of those items and then separately any signs of a fasterthanexpected credit normalization on the consumer side perhaps in your merchant partnerships or anything thanks brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its brendan i can take that on the mortgage side look this is fully expected these are sort of an administrative move of customers that have been in forbearance for quite some time weve done extensive analytics on how much loss exposure we have to folks that are coming off of forbearance on to a full repayment schedule and its de minimis especially in the mortgage side weve got very significant coverage on our loan to value and so we feel really confident in that citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 just broadly on the consumer book we havent seen much of any early signs that were starting to see a tick up and return to normal were expecting one but the delinquency levels generally remain in very strong spot and significantly depressed some of the newer portfolios that weve talked a lot about over the years on these calls and others around student loans and merchant point of sale maintained incredible strength and have not shown any signs of uptick in early delinquency whatsoever so we feel really confident around the outlook the state of credit and consumer is at the lowest levels thats ever been and we continue to sort of beat to the positive almost every month on what were seeing on ncos so i feel really good and i think and when you look at the other side of the ledger for the average consumer theyre still showing a lot of excess liquidity the money in consumer checking accounts are still at alltime highs really hasnt moved down while were seeing a lot of velocity in customers using credit cards and spending and paying for things its not adding to outstanding so in order to believe that youll start to see a meaningful correction on the credit line i think youd have to see some deflation on the excess cash builtup in the consumers wallet and start to see a rebound in receivables building up on the credit cards so we havent seen that so all the early indicators just arent moving yet of course we do expect it will but just right now its not so well take it bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island id just add to that john is all the early warning signs are flashing green which is great so on the consumer side delinquency roll rates some of the things brendan quoted all appear really really good similarly on the commercial side the credit class ratio continues to go down and the heightened theres very few credits that are in heightened monitoring so that also bodes well for the future you can at these very low levels for things like chargeoffs and npas you can see kind of one item can kind of move that number around a little bit but overall we feel really really positive about the outlook for credit for certainly the balance of this year john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks bruce operator thank you your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities your line is now open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks i was just curious are there any plans to manage the available for sale securities portfolio just given the rising rates or any plans to move any of it into like held to maturity or hedge some of this john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its a good question i mean i think were in about a little bit less than call it high single digits with htm in the first quarter i think youll see that that number will rise in the second quarter based upon a number of things that were doing weve put a lot were putting a lot of securities to work just in cfg standalone just given the environment now that theres a highly attractive place to grow the securities book at north of yields just on standalone citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 and then of course weve closed on the acquisition of investors and theres about billion of securities there that were rotating out of the profile that they had into the profile that looks like the kinds of securities that we own so theres lots of opportunities to address that and youre likely to see the htm percentage rise in the second quarter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks and then so secondly just on the hsbc acquisition i think at the time of the announcement in may there was about billion in deposits and you closed it with billion in deposits do you think at these levels deposits hold steady you can grow them just that if you could just talk about that change in the outlook brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah a prelegal day one the rundown in deposits is principally driven by their online business and a segment of international customers that were rotating into banks that have more global capabilities and so the good news on that is that we didnt have to pay a premium of any kind for those customers that we werent really going to consider core we had modeled in essentially twice the level of deposit attrition postlegal day one than you would normally expect in a deal like that given the profile of the customers that were banking at hsbc the good news is since legal day one it looks like a lot of that attrition had accelerated prelegal day one and weve seen the portfolio at a broadly stable level with good sales very strong sales and normal expected ins and outflows on the back book and so we do expect that to be stable now and start to get into growth mode as we ramp up our marketing activities which would obviously be a bit of a benefit on the deal model side offsetting some of the shortfall in deposits we got on legal day one so we feel really really good on the early signs that were seeing here we are six or seven weeks in john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i was just going to add given we had the transition prelegal day one that we dont have to pay for it and it produces the trend with the attrition happening postlegal day one i just wanted to add that data point peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks a lot operator thank you your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning gents bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bruce you said in your opening comments that obviously the focus this year is to integrate the acquisition you did in the metro new york marketplace but in the wealth space if something was priced right that would be something youd consider thinking about the florida franchise as you build that out if a depository came up at attractive pricing and again i know youve played this full with what youre doing in new york is that something that you could consider or really no were going to wait until we get these things fully integrated before we consider a depository deal bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i dont see us looking at a depository there any time soon i think weve got enough on our plate that getting off to this really great start and launching new york metro is job one we do have a strategy in florida that i think is interesting so we had a couple of de novo wealth centers one in palm beach and one in naples that weve focused on launching and starting to get those to the right customer levels and the right staffing so that we can really make some traction in those markets and then we had five or six come over from hsbc very attractive locations and branches with good staffing in the miami area and so again thats job one is to try to really make that work what we have and really drive up the performance of those sites and keep getting smart on the market keep talking to people keep trying to figure out kind of where would the next city be where we think we could come in and make an entrance and gain some share so thats to me the focus and well keep trying to get smart in the market but lets digest what we have and make that productive the other point id make with respect to florida and elsewhere where were kind of outside of our core footprint is were investing heavily in the digital bank and very recently weve migrated to a new cloudbased core platform which is really exciting for us and its going to unlock the ability for us to really broaden our offerings and integrate those offerings on the digital platform and so thats kind of also twinned with some light branches in markets like florida can we really start to bang the opportunity through our digital platforms and then over time well figure out what physical presence do we need to complement those digital offerings so its pretty exciting we have a similar opportunity in the greater washington area where we picked up i think its or branches from hsbc so we can try to attack that market through digital and decide is nine or ten the right number are they in the right locations do we need to alter that and then using test and learning from florida and from dc are there some other attractive cities where we might want to go next and really put effort into growing the digital presence combined with some thin branch presence gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good bruce and to pivot the next question is on deposits how do you guys weigh you talked about how certificates of deposits have come down dramatically youve got a very strong dva balance core now much higher than when you went public of course but with rates moving up so quickly now the year is almost at today when does longterm funding with lowcost cds make sense and then don when do your citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2022 customers start asking for higher compensating balances as rates move up have you guys seen more discussions there as well on the compensating balances on the commercial side john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start a couple of thoughts there i mean i think as you heard from brendan earlier and you saw on our slide our cd portfolio was much smaller than it was before and what that at the start and i think what the point there is is that cds could be part of the story and but we would do it in a way thats connected to a deep customer relationship rather than sort of a pseudo wholesale funding approach which is i think how things got played out early in the last cycle for us whereas this cycle its all going to be about customer relationships i think the other thing to keep in mind is that over the last cycle we expect cd betas to be lower during the cycle in part due to how quickly you think the cycle is going to go the last cycle took a longer time two to three years and so you kept getting that ratcheted up cost to cds every time they came to maturity so i do think cd is going to be part of the story given deep customer relationships and a shorter cycle cds can absolutely be something of a tool that well utilize coming off a lower base so thats the first point and the second point is that on the commercial side you will have balance migration thats natural as compensating balances dont need to be quite as high to as earnings credit rates actually rise over time so yeah there will be some of that migration thats built into the deposit betas that we articulated earlier and built into our deposit costs overall and so but its the same point there that given the number of ways that we can interact with our customers on the commercial side were deepening our relationships there and expect that those migrations will be well controlled and as expected donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i think thats exactly right and weve actually gone out over the last month or so with a full core information package with all of our bankers to discuss deposit and pricing levels as part of the overall relationship with all of our relationship managers so were well on top of it we have had some people pull deposits but we havent had a problem backfilling in and bringing in other deposits to basically cover any outflows gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you for the color bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay all right i think thats it for the questions in the queue and let me just close by thanking everybody again for dialing in today we appreciate your interest and your
