and what weve accomplished during the course of the quarter and today were going to review the third quarter results and update of our threeyear forecast and provide an overview on our key strategic initiatives as ive mentioned in the past it is important for the board and management team that we remain engaged with the analyst community and investors on our progress as we continue to transition for the remainder of and during the third quarter we continue to make significant progress on multiple fronts towards our goal of becoming a diversified regional bank which focuses on consumer small business commercial banking private banking and commercial real estate and some of the actions that weve taken over the last three to five months point us in that direction new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 turning to slide under the first area you will see that with our board transformation complete we are quickly building out our middle market commercial banking and specialized industry lending verticals with the addition of over new hires in this space over the last days this includes seasoned lenders and the infrastructure to support them in addition were excited we also hired a new chief information officer his name is chris higgins chris previously worked at us bank and most recently was the cioo at mufg chris brings tremendous amounts of experience and will be a key asset and leader in the company as we go forward as well one of the things i think were most excited about as we continue to attract toptier talent to the organization in virtually every area excuse me every area of the company and im very confident in the leadership team to the bank as far as our executing on our operating plan this quarter was the second consecutive quarter of really solid deposit growth both in retail and in the private bank in the private bank were seeing many customers returning to the bank after the disruption earlier this year and we are winning new relationships moreover the private banking deposits are more moderately priced having weighted average costs in the low range last quarter i talked about the opportunity to exit another billion to billion in noncore businesses during the quarter we made this strategic decision to exit certain nonrelationshipbased businesses and reduce our exposures under some larger exposure where we syndicated our positions out within the ci portfolio as a result the ci loans declined billion or compared to the second quarter to the runoff of these loans our proforma cet1 ratio including the impact of the sale of the msr and thirdparty origination business is which compares very favorably to our peers and as a matter we do anticipate at the end of this month the first of november of closing the sale of the servicing msr and thirdparty broker business to mr cooper also we made significant progress in reducing operating expenses through head count reductions and cost controls while still investing in key areas like our commercial private banking and our risk infrastructure last week we announced a workforce reduction plan which will show up in our fourth quarter results and in addition to that weve also taken out significant nonpersonnel cost as we focus the organization and brought talent in to perform functions within the organization and as craig will speak to you shortly we are on track to meet our earnings forecast goals by yearend under improved funding profile and these are one of the areas that when craig and i first arrived we talked about increasing the liquidity in the company our liquidity remains extremely strong at over billion resulting in an approximate coverage to uninsured deposits we also utilized a portion of our excess liquidity during the quarter to pay down billion of wholesale borrowings and during the month of october we paid down an additional billion which will help improve our funding cost over time finally there is our focus on credit and risk management youll get a chance to hear from kris gagnon our new chief credit officer we have completed reviewing virtually the entire cre portfolio at the end of the third quarter we were complete compared to in the second quarter we continue to proactively manage our problem loans and take appropriate action to derisk the loan portfolio including taking significant chargeoffs and continuing to build our allowance for credit losses in addition we continue to add both talent and resources in our risk management area as we buildout our risk governance infrastructure slide highlights the five key takeaways for the third quarter the biggest takeaway from our perspective is that our multifamily borrowers continue to support their properties during the first nine months of the year approximately billion of our multifamily reached their repricing date and in most instances these properties new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 are repricing from the mid3 to the mid or higher of these loans over have either paid off or are at par or remain current we also continue to reduce our cre exposure as kris will discuss we had another strong quarter and loan payoffs as you know one of our key strategic goals is to reduce our cre portfolio to about billion over time and these payoffs certainly will help us towards that goal deposit growth as weve previously discussed in our prior earnings calls was another one of the highlights this quarter this growth along with us paying down about a third of our wholesale borrowings resulted in a positive shift in our funding mix and lastly i believe we are wellpositioned to successfully execute on our ci strategy which weve talked about trying to get significant growth in ci which i will discuss in the next two slides on slide highlights the senior management team we have assembled within the commercial and industrial space to drive our growth in this area rich raffetto oversees this effort and has assembled what i believe as a longtime commercial banker myself some of the best leadership in the industry reflecting our commitment to this strategic area of growth as you can see we are hiring a proven group of individuals to execute on our business strategy slide outlines our ci strategy we already have a good platform to build from with approximately billion of ci loans our goal is to get that to billion in the next three to five years by expanding our existing platform across middle market corporate banking and various specialized industries and building out our product capabilities and to drive fee income in relationship pricing part of this buildout includes hiring more experienced bankers and support staff to date we have brought in more than individuals and continue to attract top talent im really pleased with how far the management team has brought the company over the last seven months we are building a great company that will be reflected in our future financial results and ill now turn it over to craig and i look forward to your questions craig e gifford chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you joseph on slide you can see our financial balance sheet information and you can see that our cet ratio on a pro forma basis for the sale of the msr business as joseph mentioned is we ended the quarter with an actual gaap ratio of the 60basispoint increase on a proforma basis reflects the lower rwas from the sale of the mortgage transaction as well as the increase in capital that comes from the small gain that we expect to recognize on the transaction joseph mentioned that we expect that transaction will close in the next couple of weeks adjusting for aoci our proforma cet1 ratio is in general we have lower securities unrealized losses than our peers and you can see that our liquidity position is robust and continues to improve slides and present an updated forecast out through and ill cover some of the more relevant changes from prior information that we provided the most significant updates reflect an expectation that our nonaccrual loans will remain elevated through which kris will discuss in more detail we also reflect an expectation of a higher fdic assessment cost level through principally related to our criticized and classified loan levels new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 and theres a line switch between margin and fees related to the cost of subservicing deposits that go away this quarter which ill describe on the next page you can see that from a ratio perspective the impact of those items does reflect an expectation from a eps perspective of a reduced level of earnings in and but as we get beyond the nonaccruals and the fdic assessment increases we would expect to be consistent with our previous expectations turning to slide from a margin perspective as i mentioned we will have pressure on noninterest excuse me on interest income related to a higher level of nonaccruals out through additionally in and theres roughly million of a change in remapping of interest expense on the custodial deposits which reduces from prior forecast our net interest income and increases our noninterest income so again its just a line switch if you think about margin our margin does continue to improve beginning in through as a result principally of repricing of our commercial real estate and multifamily loan portfolio we do expect that our margin has bottomed in the third quarter youll see in our press release the margin percentage we expect a similar margin percentage in the fourth quarter and then increasing through our provision for loan losses was impacted by a chargeoff level net of recoveries of million in the third quarter we do have an expectation of a similar although probably slightly less in the fourth quarter of charge offs and then tapering in our expectation for the full year of provision for loan losses for is a billion to billion thats an increase from our prior guidance and that is related to our experience on the chargeoffs associated with multifamily loans as kris will point out the multifamily portfolio continues to perform quite well and the vast majority of loans that are in our nonaccrual portfolio continue to be current on their payments from a noninterest expense perspective we do expect a higher level of fdic assessment again principally related to the criticized and classified portfolio that has an impact of about million a year in and incrementally in the fourth quarter of this year the mortgage transaction will close in the next couple of weeks but we had previously anticipated that it would be completed by the end of september regulatory approvals delay that a little bit and that will have a little bit of a negative impact on expenses for the fourth quarter these reflect those changes slide shows the success that were having on the deposit gathering front as joseph said earlier on the call this is the second quarter of very solid deposit growth we continue to grow deposits in the retail channel up billion or just under this quarter we also had a very good deposit growth quarter in the private bank with deposits increasing billion or to nearly billion as our bankers are successfully winning new relationships and many customers are returning dollars to the bank more importantly the private banking deposits overall carry a lower cost of funds that generally are more moderately priced and now ill turn the call over to kris gagnon to discuss our asset quality and credit metrics kris a gagnon chief credit officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you craig new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 if we turn to slide we had just over billion in commercial real estate payoffs during the third quarter bringing the yeartodate amount to billion importantly these payoffs were at par and approximate of these payoffs were related to our substandard portfolio if we move to slide this is an update of our annual cre portfolio overview through the third quarter we have reviewed of the total cre portfolio that includes of the multifamily portfolio of the office and of the nonoffice cre we turn to slide just an overview of the multifamily portfolio the key takeaways here are that yeartodate we had billion of multifamily loans repricing of those loans paid off at par and the remainder stayed within the bank well talk about the repricing that were facing going forward in the next slides so slide provides a few more details on the multifamily portfolio approximately of the portfolio is left to review these are loans with an average balance of million so were getting to the smaller end of the portfolio all of the largest loans in the portfolio have been reviewed and nearly all of the loans with rent regulated units between and of total units have been reviewed what i want to spend a little bit of time though is on the bottomright side of the portfolio as you can see through we have a significant amount of loans that multifamily loans that are either going to reprice or mature and the important thing to understand here is that as these loans enter a window months in advance we reevaluate those loans at current market rates and their ability to service those loans the borrower to service those loans on the changed terms this can lead to more severe classification of those loans if the result of the analysis is that the cash flow is either impaired or insufficient to service the loans appropriately moving on to the office portfolio on slide we reviewed of this portfolio again i think weve gotten through the largest loans so theres the remaining is generally smaller balanced loans weve been very proactive and aggressive in managing this portfolio weve taken significant chargeoffs through the years with this portfolio because early on the larger loans that we looked at there were some idiosyncratic losses i think were largely through those issues the office reserves associated with remainder of the loans in the portfolio is which compares favorably alongside our peers slide is our nonoffice cre portfolio of this portfolio has been reviewed most loans that remain to be reviewed are again less the smaller end of the portfolio which are nonnew york city loans its a very diversified portfolio slide provides our allowance by loan category our allowance for credit loss is up to this quarter compared to the prior quarter and then slide provides some further perspective around asset quality we have been diligently identifying problem loans and working towards resolution you can see that on this slide that this quarter we had approximately million increase in our nonaccrual portfolio important to note that of these nonaccruals are actually performing as agreed to the terms of their credit agreement and this sort of relates back to the issue that we talked about before as we put some of these loans on nonaccrual or substandard is related to future ability to pay as they enter those repricing windows so with that craig ill turn it back over to you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 craig e gifford chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc okay thank you kris slide depicts our liquidity profile overall our liquidity remains quite strong due to the success of our deposit gathering efforts over the last two quarters we have billion of total liquidity which represents about of our uninsured deposits slide summarizes our third quarter financials and as i mentioned the net loss attributable to common stockholders was million or per share principally driven by the provision to expense for the quarter it was also related to a lower level of noninterest income due to the sale of the mortgage warehouse portfolio which closed in july joseph ill turn the call back to you joseph m otting executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc okay thanks kris and craig one final slide before well turn it over for questions on slide we show new york cbs investment profile we currently trade at of tangible book value we think being able to move forward and deal with our credit issues and then the emergence of our ci strategy should help close that gap this compares to for category iv banks and about for regional banks so a significant upside in the company as we execute on the business plan i would also like to thank a number of you recommended and suggested that we convert our holding company name we chose flagstar financial with the symbol will begin trading on monday as flg this aligns the overall organization going forward with our flagstar brand in the branches which between november and march of last year and november to march of this year we rebranded all the branches with a consistent brand consistent look and consistent theme now all across our retail banking franchise which all of you know is california arizona florida new york new jersey and then around michigan great lakes so a really solid retail banking presence so finally id like to thank each of our teammates for their dedication and determination and their commitment to our customers and now wed be happy to answer any questions you may have operator you can now open the line for questions new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hello good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate all the color and the moving pieces between the old and new guide was any of the change from the change in the forward rate curve can you talk about how you think the balance sheet is positioned for rate cuts here craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so were slightly liability sensitive we will benefit from a bit from lower rates we do have quite a bit of very shortterm assets in our cash and securities portfolio so well certainly benefit from a deposit side perspective but there will be pressure on the on balance sheet liquidity aspect of the portfolio i would say though that weve been very successful in bringing down our deposit rates in the last six weeks so on our more liabilities our more rate sensitive deposits our savings portfolios and our ctes weve actually have a higher than basis points beta we brought down those rates between basis points and basis points compared to the federal reserve move so weve been very successful in tapering that the impact of that in the fourth quarter will be a lower level of deposit gathering on the retail bank i would expect i think that will be flat to slightly positive from a retail deposit gathering and but i still think well see strength in the private bank probably not as strong as the third quarter was but well still see deposit growth in the private bank in the fourth quarter manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and if i can have a quick followup so it seems like that the main difference between the two guides between last quarter and this quarter is the the nonaccrual loans so whats causing those nonaccrual loans to remain on the balance sheet for longer is it that youd rather not sell them given the pricing being offered in the open market and would you consider selling them down the line kris a gagnon a chief credit officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 yeah thank you for that question were exploring all opportunities to reduce our nonaccrual portfolio were working with borrowers to work them out we are looking at discounted payoffs we will explore the market to see if theres an opportunity to sell in some cases so far as weve looked at that we think that we can do better working them out ourselves as opposed to selling them so those are some of the avenues that were taking to reduce the portfolio manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey just wanted to followup on the credit comments so the of loans on nonaccrual and the maturity profile that you show through im just trying to get to it looks like your provisioning outlook did not change quarteroverquarter as you talk look into so are we to conclude that at this point credit quality risk tied to repricing all of that even for loans that are coming up for repricing in has been ring fenced either through reserves or these loans have been already put into nonaccrual so what im getting to is the risk of negative surprises on credit from here should be fairly limited and talk to us in terms of the rate sensitivity like the fiveyear being basis points or basis points higher or lower from where it is today does that have a meaningful impact in that analysis craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc ebrahim thank you so the rate profile is interesting right because at the end of the third quarter rates had come down at the fiveyear point roughly basis points but since then theyve backed up about basis points to basis points so we were cautious in reflecting the improvement in rates in the reserving recognizing that it can be transient but i will say that the decrease in rate levels that weve seen is quite favorable to the portfolio in our credit modeling probably about a million improvement in the credit risk profile as a result of the improvement in rates and i would expect a similar level of that as rates continue if rates continue to decline at the intermediate term but importantly its that intermediate term point that is particularly relevant for the repricing of these loans new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 as kris mentioned if you look out into the projections from a provisioning standpoint i do expect that the provisioning for the timeframe is still relatively in line i think that well see a higher level of chargeoffs in the first quarter and tapering through the rest of the year kris pointed out on slide the maturity profile or the reset profile of the portfolio so we are effectively reflecting in our criticized and classified loans those loans that we would expect to reprice out through the middle of so thats months from now and if you look at that chart then you still have a reset profile out beyond that which would be reflected as we then begin to regrade those loans as they move into that that repricing window that we analyze from a loan rating perspective but we feel like from a provisioning perspective the guide reflects the impact of that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that was helpful and just one followup question maybe joseph for you i think you talked about where the stock trade from relative tangible book i think the concern from an investor standpoint is the lack of visibility like youve seen a lot of senior hires that youve announced but we saw the big change in earnings outlook relative to what we expected last quarter appreciate is the same just talk to us in terms of how we can measure all the senior hires that youre bringing on to the bank banking is a tough business even doing a roe so im just trying to understand is the goal and should we start seeing proof points of these teams and come and we should see accelerated low cost deposit growth loan growth as we look even starting fourth quarter and whats the best way to measure that we are moving in the right direction in that regard joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you ebrahim i think it first starts with like how are we rebalancing the balance sheet and our goals here were sitting somewhere slightly south of billion in commercial real estate and our goal is to get that into the low billion range and so were doing that through a combination of payoffs which are averaging somewhere around since weve arrived roughly billion a quarter so obviously thats billion times three is billion so we naturally get there in a threeyear period so that rebalancing is occurring with going in our ci book today which is about billion in we would like to get that into the billion range is our goal and so most of us who have joined this company have spent the vast majority of our career in the ci kind of space and grew up in it and so weve gone out and have added really talented people who are highly experienced who have operated in this space for some of us to years so we bring those relationships and direct involvement with ceos and cfos and companies that we bank so to answer your question we do see right away the ability as these people come on to the organization the opportunity to do outward bound solicitation into relationships and the other avenue is if you look at the makeup of our ci portfolio very limited of that is commercial and corporate banking and the type of people that were hiring are commercial and corporate bankers so it isnt like were going into these syndicated credits or large one or twobank credits where we have a lot of exposure in that area we are somewhat of a new entrant into that segment of the market which should present us some pretty significant growth opportunities craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 the balance sheet projections if you think about the portfolio that reprices and resets and the experience that weve had in repayments if you look out on a projected basis something between million and billion of commercial real estate and multifamily runoff per quarter over the next two years and as we get into late were projecting a pretty similar level of increases in commercial banking and ci growth from a loan perspective were also expecting that those bankers bring in deposits and that will increase our deposit growth starting in late pretty significantly through and into roughly i think about it as roughly a twoforonebasis loans for deposits so were expecting that that commercial banking group does bring in deposits that are supportive in funding that loan profile ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you both joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc sorry if i missed this earlier but i heard you mentioned the billion to billion of assets that youve had assessed as noncore and you talked about that last quarter as well was just wondering where you guys stand on that now just given the runoff that weve seen on the ci front and then are you still looking at the business and trying to analyze for core noncore and could that increase from here how are you guys thinking about that joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah weve done virtually a business review of all the businesses now in the company and are in the markets generating new ci loans while some of those had been tabled prior to our arrival but we are the viewpoint overall is that the businesses that we have today we like there are certain aspects of some of the businesses where we wanted to reduce our exposure either because where we are in the cycle in relationship to that industry or our viewpoint was in some of the hold levels in the company were larger than what our comfort level was and so we brought the hold levels down and then brought participants in for those credits new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 so id say its a combination of reevaluating where we are in the cycles for certain industries and then the other is reducing hold limits the bank historically took very light hold positions in credit and we just favor a more diversified portfolio david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and wheres the billion to billion now is that billion to billion just given some of the runoff or where do you see it today craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc were not anticipating any significant portfolio repositioning in the near term at this point i could see a bit more of the rescaling on some credits but i think itll be less significant than it was in the third quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great all right thanks guys appreciate it joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah operator our next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please go ahead craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hello mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hey mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co this quarter you made some pretty sizable changes to your projections outlook over the next couple of years and i guess im trying to get a sense for i certainly understand theres a lot of moving parts here but trying to get a sense for how much more confidence you have in these projection than you did in the old ones and whether were likely to see similar kinds of variability in coming periods craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 yeah i would say that we continue to improve our visibility into the portfolio into the credit performance and into the expense profile of the company this is now joseph and i second quarter of indepth review of the financials we have instituted an indepth review at the business line level each month on our financial performance with each of the senior leaders so every month we get more and more visibility i have a pretty good degree of confidence in the noninterest income excuse me in the net interest income and the margin line at this point again theres a bit of noise in the everyones comparing the projections because of the remap associated with the cost of those mortgage deposits we had projected that as a benefit in the margin line thats actually a benefit in the fees line which is where the where that has previously been recorded from an expense perspective the other areas obviously what were seeing from a noninterest expense perspective we did take a pretty significant action last week that will improve our expense profile on an ongoing basis roughly million a year and we still have more to go so this forecast expects that we will continue to identify efficiency opportunities many of which are underway as we continue to improve our technology capabilities and our business processes and those will result in further cost improvements as we get into the and early timeframe the fdic assessment pressure is something that its related to the business profile and related to the the way the fdic determines its insurance premiums its a complex formula but it does encompass some things that are that provide that result in an increased rate for us and i expect thatll go through thats probably the most significant change in the forecast from an earnings perspective mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just one quick followup im curious craig on your modeling what are you assuming in terms of the balance sheet size maybe at the end of and the end of craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc were essentially assuming a relatively flat balance sheet were assuming that we will see a transition from commercial real estate multifamily loans into ci loans as the real estate loans repay and runoff and the ci begins to come on as those bankers get traction in the marketplace so not seeing a lot of balance sheet growth or projecting a lot of balance sheet growth through but we are projecting a degree of balance sheet growth in the commercial banking space in mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator our next question comes from the line of bernard vongizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning first question is on revamping the company structure you know youve done a good job on bringing new hires on the senior management level and changing the board i know you highlighted progress within ci can you just talk to like what inning you are in with regards to building out your ci platform new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 and then in risk management given previous deficiencies identified how far are you with revamping your risk control function and then just lastly on the same topic any other further head count optimization left to go that hasnt been announced joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yes so at obviously the board level we announced that peter who is a longtime flagstar board member will be leaving the board and we do anticipate to fill that position hopefully in the fourth quarter so that is kind of the remaining board spot at the kind of what i would call the executive management team we are fully deployed now and with the addition of chris higgins that completes the rebuild of the executive management the next level down weve hired to people in that category where weve upgraded both risk positions and infrastructure under craigs world of finance people to help us prepare our financials we have confidence in them and then when you look at the two specific areas you mentioned id say in the ci were rounding first base is what i would say we anticipate to go from roughly hires to hires its whats built into our plan that we will build that out so we have a fair amount of hiring to do but were not hiring all those people at once now were going to start to grow the revenue and so it will be a revenue of seeing the revenue then well add the expense seeing the revenue out the expense on the risk infrastructure i think thats a relatively good story of the direction and how far weve come in seven months obviously weve added some really highly talented people who worked at the occ for the vast majority of their careers that includes bob phelps sydney menefee and bryan hubbard so three very senior people from the occ and it helped us one of the things that were doing in the company is really building out the first and second and third line of defenses those were not here in the organization and as everybody knows that category bank core bank you have enhanced standards you have to adhere to but i really feel good about the people and the direction that were going in that regards and i do believe that we work closely with the regulatory community since we all arrived i mean obviously my background of being the comptroller i understand the importance of that and so i think weve built a strong bridge to our regulatory regulators we appreciate their input and guidance as we build this but i would say as we look the risk infrastructure we feel really good about where we are with the risk management in the organization our internal audit and were building out the first line of defense in the business units and thats also built into our cost model bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for that color just maybe as a followup so you paid down nearly billion of borrowings utilizing your excess liquidity from the business sales and deposit growth and you noted that you paid down an initial billion in october what are you targeting as a normalized level of borrowings and how can we think of the pace of those coming down from here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so thanks for the question so if you look at the third quarter we will have a reduction in the overall liquidity of about billion related to the mortgage servicing sale business sale so those deposits will leave and we have been holding excess liquidity to provide for that from here i think that will relatively match the loan growth with deposit growth we have a bit of excess liquidity that we will use to reduce our broker deposit funding in as those brokered deposits which are principally cds come due we wont i dont expect it will replace those brokered deposits on a dollarfordollar basis so well see the broker deposit funding come down and then as we grow customer deposits particularly in the private banking commercial space then well look to continue to repay some of our wholesale borrowings with the home loan bank but i wouldnt expect that it would be material in the rest of and assuming the rest of and then maybe a couple of billion dollars bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays please go ahead joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks okay just circling back on the deposit trends could you give us a spot rate on the deposit costs at the end of the quarter and then you talked about a beta the early beta being greater than on some of the retail deposits how should we be thinking about beta over the next few rate cuts craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so our spot rate on our savings is is at that was about basis points three or if you call it six months ago even three months ago so we brought that down over basis points and i would expect to see that continue to decrease as rates decline here in the fourth quarter a bit further modeling from an overall interest bearing deposit perspective im modeling a basis points beta obviously on the more premium product itll be more significant than that and from a private banking perspective again we see thats a little more moderate deposit base because it has more noninterest bearing dda type of accounts there so when we bring on those deposits generally that has not been in our at our most premium rates its been in a more moderated rate and thats what i would expect going forward jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 okay all right thanks and then as a followup how should we be thinking about the multifamily reserve level here with the expectation for higher losses have you been reserving for that or we should expect to see that reserve level start to go higher with the provisioning going forward craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well its a balance of the expectations around the criticized and classified portfolio as well as the level of charge offs i dont expect to see the reserve level coming down significantly in the in the fourth quarter in the first quarter beyond that as we get into and particularly as the portfolio gets through a lot of the repricing and we see how the borrowers perform against that repricing that will inform where we go with reserve levels but i think well see a pretty consistent reserve level for the next quarter or two jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with citi please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i just wanted to clarify something here on your guide a little bit forward couple of years because i believe craig you talked about the remapping so if you look at nii change and then fees change and the remapping was kind of associated with the ecr excuse me just remapping of a couple of items so netnet like revenue is down million thats kind of what you wanted to convey i just wanted to make sure thats the net change associated indiscernible revenue difference craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah to keep it simple in and theres million that moves from non from net interest income to noninterest income and thats associated with the earnings credit on the escrow deposits subserviced escrow deposits incrementally i do expect a higher level of nonaccruals than what we had previously contemplated out through and that has an increased level of pressure in the guide for benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you okay and then coming at ecr or excuse me from an expense guide perspective you guys had increased at million so when you think is that million of that roughly to fdic that guidance for kind of just the creditrelated items which is really just temporary like once you have lower rate you assume you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 could probably do a little bit better on the credit review and so that doesnt get taxed its not tax deductible thats kind of what the difference is i know its the footnote here so im just trying to think like your guidance didnt really change much youre just kind of elongating that expense craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc particularly with respect to the fdic thats correct yeah the piece related to taxes is mostly because the tax rate moves around quite a bit and thats because the fdic piece is pretty sizable the fdic assessment is pretty sizable and being nondeductible it represents a fairly large percentage of the bottom line over the next two years and that causes the tax rate to move around so that footnote is just explaining the tax rate benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you so when you think about that rate perspective if you were to move rates lower back to kind of where it is were recently a couple of weeks ago youd probably get a little bit more of a green light to change how long do you need to be in that green light you need straight months before things would look better on a credit perspective due to the rates or im just trying to think about the timing of which you think itd look like it is better but you cant just oscillate these things quartertoquarter based on rates themselves craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc right we cant move them around and the other challenge is that once we once we do have a downgrade the rates have to move pretty substantially in order for us to be able to upgrade the loans and so that that pressure continues out for a couple of years i do expect itll be through benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you okay appreciate the color thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning and thanks for hosting us just want to clarify if the substandard and special mention loans are falling this quarter or kind of what you see as their trend from here joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah in the fourth quarter i would expect to see that our special mention and substandard loans will continue to increase at a not at the pace that weve seen thus far but as we we still have a bit of financial information to get through and we have things moving into the repricing window so i think the trend would be for an increase in substandard and special mention christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 okay and they are higher at the end of september just given the inflow outflow i mean that payoffs which you also push the new loans in from the repricing schedule as you said is that right joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats correct christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay got it and then on the general cost of funds for the company going forward how would you look at that relative to wherever fed funds goes like if we look at a year from now if fed funds is ph for example would the cost of funds be at a more of a discount to that than it is today craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc im thinking about the math of your question i think that the answer would be our average cost of funds would be at roughly the same discount that it is today on in total if you think about our funding profile about half of our funding profile is very shortterm priced and the other half is either noninterest bearing or longerterm priced so you can kind of do the math of that as the fed moves the shortterm price component of that i expect that well see a very high beta on that so virtually all of our wholesale funding at this point is priced something under a year and of course our savings deposits are moved immediately so i think that youll see that discount remain roughly the same over time joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc the mix will change a little bit with wholesale with more ci customers coming on board the mix of that will move more to transaction accounts which should help as well christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you very much for that background joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah operator our next question will come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great the loantodeposit ratio is it about where you would like it to be longerterm kind of low craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc id actually like to see it be a bit higher i think that will continue to gather customer deposits over the course of the next two years well see a relatively flat overall balance sheet and continue to gather deposits then so i would expect that it would improve that well see a continued decrease of the loan to deposit ratio but it wont be of the significance that weve seen in the last two quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then just a couple of housekeeping items for the fourth quarter just teasing through the one timers that are in the guide could you just help spell out the fees and expenses for the fourth quarter and also the share count once the almost all the preferreds are converted thanks craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so the share count has pretty much settled down the end of quarter share count will be is reflective of the expectation on an ongoing basis virtually all of the preferred that i expect will convert in the near term did convert in the third quarter and thats been public information from a onetimer perspective in the fourth quarter i do expect that well see some charges associated with the mortgage business transaction exit so well have some asset impairments and a bit of severance and then the action that we took last week also have some severance associated with it all in i think that those charges will be in the million range christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay great thank you craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning i was hoping we could first talk a little bit about loan portfolio yields so loan yields have been down for four consecutive quarters despite kind of a positive repricing narrative and repricing dynamics within cre multifamily so i guess how much accretion was there this quarter within loan yields how much impact did nonaccruals have and when do you think we can actually start to see loan yields begin to expand new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc the majority of the impact on from decreasing loan yields is from the nonaccruals there is not much accretion at this point thats built into the margin or that would go away its maybe million a quarter that tapers off over the next four quarters if we think about from a repricing perspective here you can see that weve got about billion a year that will reprice and that moves up from an average rate of about billion to in our forecast we do have rates coming down but at that intermediate term level not a lot so we see that those loans as they come in from a repricing perspective reprice from the billion level up to the billion level so thats whats driving the increase and i do think that well see that that turn in the fourth quarter a bit and then as we get into and we see less incremental nonaccruals than what weve had on a quarterly basis for the last two quarters then well see that turn positive matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then i just wanted to go back youve noted that you expect the balance sheet to be flat a couple of times now if i look at the forward guide the nii and then guide it implies it will take earning assets down to around billion in and from billion today can you just talk a little bit about that and then the pros and cons of going below billion as it relates to category iv bank designation it feels like youre hesitant to go that route to go sub billion im curious if theres more to it than we currently understand joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so regarding the billion level if you work your way through that if you get below billion you still have four quarters that you are anticipated to be compliant with the category iv and then from a regulatory perspective when you start to get close to billion you have to put in place a plan to become compliant so just because you get below billion doesnt mean that you dont have to have the enhanced standards so that isnt like our target to get below billion and said what weve taken the approach was to build out the appropriate risk infrastructure in the company and then allow our business model to take it where we can grow and expand and so it isnt a goal of ours it isnt a desire and quite frankly you probably have to shrink billion or more to get to the point where you wouldnt be subject to those standards matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood is my thinking correct in that earning assets could shrink billion to billion here craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah but i think that theres a reasonable chunk of that is actually coming out from a cash perspective so its earning but were deploying that cash either to pay down debt or to pay down brokered deposits so in the loan portfolio i dont expect it to be decreasing as much as the cash component matthew breese q analyst stephens inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 appreciate that thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i dont know if this is an easy question or hard question but if the economy stays in kind of a steady state when do you guys think well see the peak in nonperformers craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc i think the repricing that comes into the portfolio over the course of the next two years will continue to have a component of it that moves into nonperforming and so i think well see a continued level of new additions to nonperformings through and then the question becomes how quickly we will be able to action the existing portfolio of nonperformers many of the loans that are in the nonaccrual category are in there because of our focus on looking out at the repricing characteristics and a pretty stringent assumption that or a criteria that from a classification standpoint would suggest that we expect them to default the reality is that we see the vast majority of them continuing to perform even when they do reprice and so that will those loans are performing they are amortizing their principal balances but i think that well continue to see new loans being added to the nonperforming portfolio over the course of the next two years as loans reprice jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc anything unusual about this quarter in terms of the review obviously it didnt go up like last quarter but are you saying this is increasing at a decreasing rate or how material do you expect it to be the increases kris a gagnon a chief credit officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah no there wasnt anything particularly unique about this quarter we just continued to run our process we still had financials to grind through the level of new substandards sort of in the same pace that we saw before weve gotten through the bigger loans so its smaller so were looking at a lot of smaller loans that more widgets but there wasnt much of a change were just sort of getting through it this is an annual process as craig said this will continue each year well have to do new financial reviews and review these loans as theyre getting into the refinance window so i wouldnt say that theres anything unique joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 the one thing that i would add is kris as this is an annual process but we went to a standard on the expectation is that the borrowers would provide us the financial data and perhaps in the past there was more lax about whether they sent their financial data into the company and then second of all i think theres a new standard of underwriting around debt service coverage and loantovalue as opposed to using loantovalue for the risk rating process and so that in itself theres more rigor around your primary and secondary source of repayment kris a gagnon a chief credit officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yes i agree with that joseph we were very aggressive in terms of getting financial information and i think of our borrowers provided financial information which is significantly higher than in the past and we did in the second quarter institute changes relative to how we evaluate risk with more of a focus on debt service coverage ratio than as joseph said as opposed to loantovalue but you know that process started in the second quarter and continued on into the third and that will be our standard going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay that helps and then just two others you guys do a lot of benchmarking in the presentation and i know this isnt an easy question but what do you think the normalized more normalized reserve percentage should look like for the company in and into craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc from a provisioning or overall reserve percentage jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc overall reserves overall reserves yeah craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah i think our portfolio is pretty idiosyncratic and it kind of depends on how the portfolio performs as we transition into a more ci based portfolio and balance of portfolio i think that youll see the ci reserve levels will be substantially lower than what the commercial real estate levels on the existing portfolio are and so that will have an impact but it will really depend on the portfolio performance joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah portfolio mix its very important jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc the mix okay you said the mix okay i understand that and then on slide and then some of your comments about the margin thinking i hate to ask it this way but is that the easy part of the formula just the margin lift from cre repricing is that just the natural output of the maturity schedule and you have high confidence in that margin trajectory new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah the bulk of that its the margin percentage is a combination of the repricing of the commercial real estate multifamily portfolio but its actually tempered a bit with the ci build because we expected the ci loans would have a slightly lower overall spread than the commercial real estate and multifamily loans as they reprice so its the ci its the lift from the repricing balanced with the growth in the ci portfolio jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thanks guys operator our final question will come from the line of steve moss with raymond james please go ahead steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi steve kris a gagnon a chief credit officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi there steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc i just wanted to followup on nonperformers here the multifamily bucket was the driver of the increase this quarter and im just curious if thats related to the roll forward set up in terms of the 18month look forward on as you analyze whats substandard and criticized and just that maybe therell be certain quarters well see the step up given the repricing dynamics stretch out into and pick up in or if theres something special this quarter about the something else that drove that craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well this quarter is a combination of getting through more of the portfolio we moved from to of the portfolio and another quarter coming into the 18month window so to speak moving forward we have a little bit more of the catchup to do but not much and then well each quarter have more loans that will come into the window its about billion a quarter for the next four quarters that comes into the window and then the repricing that move in are about a billion a quarter that move into the window for evaluation and when they do some portion goes to substandard some portion remains in pass graded with that that repricing pathway is what will drive it moving forward if you get once we get beyond fourth quarter or weve gotten through the full portfolio review new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2024 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then just one followup here in terms of i know the secondary market seems to have improved here in the past couple of months just curious if you think theres any potential for an acceleration in prepays for the multifamily portfolio you know just in the shifting rates i know weve had a backup here in the last couple of weeks but im just curious if theres any possibility joseph m otting a executive chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so one commentary would have obviously when rates as craig mentioned backed up a bit there was somewhat of a flurry of a lot of people locking in rates i think because theyve now increased back up slightly people are waiting to see the next fed move but that should spur a fair amount of refinancing and what were finding is people are coming out of pocket to rebalance loans and our objective would be for them to take those loans elsewhere and get financing so we have found in the a number of the large office transactions we have as you probably noticed we moved one large transaction to help our sale we do expect in the month of november to close that transaction we marked it at what our agreed upon sales price was for that transaction and there are a number four or five other large transactions were under discussion at this point so there is interest even in the office space for investors and some of those were selling at where we have a market and some of them were taking slight losses but overall that we do think that will pick up and then on the multifamily side there has been kind of a renewed interest even in the rent regulated space for people looking for assets in that space so we are optimistic that in the next couple of quarters as we did bring on a new head of our workout group hes organized that group with a team who is doing outreach to customers and having dialogue we have an assigned kind of swat team thats taking that on we do think well see the fruits of that that activity going forward steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great really appreciate all the color thank you very much craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you operator and with that ill turn the call back to joseph otting for closing remarks joseph m otting executive chairman president chief executive officer new york
