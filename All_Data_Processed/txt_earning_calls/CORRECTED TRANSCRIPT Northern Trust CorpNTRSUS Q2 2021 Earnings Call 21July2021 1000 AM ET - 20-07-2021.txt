mark and mike in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page this morning we reported second quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on common equity was this quarters results included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 as you can see on the bottom of page equity markets performed well during the quarter recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels and both the sp and eafe local had strong sequential performance based on those calculation as shown on this page average one month and threemonth libor rates were stable during the quarter with only modest declines us dollar was weaker on a yearoveryear basis which had a favorable impact on our reported revenue but its unfavorable to our expenses lets move to page and review our financial highlights of the second quarter yearoveryear revenue was up with noninterest income up and net interest income down expenses increased while net income was up in a sequential comparison revenue and expense were both flat while net income taking our credit provision and taxes into account was down the provision for credit losses reflected a release of million in reserves in the current quarter compared to a provision of million in the prior year and a release of million in the prior quarter return on average common equity was through the quarter up from a year ago and consistent with the prior quarter assets under custody and administration of trillion grew from a year ago and sequentially assets under custody of trillion grew from a year ago and sequentially assets under management were trillion up from a year ago and sequentially now lets look at results in greater detail starting with revenue on page trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were up from last year and up sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the quarter down yearoveryear and down sequentially the sequential decline was driven by lower client volumes as well as lower volatility the remaining components and noninterest income totaled million in the quarter down from one year ago and down sequentially within this securities commissions and trading income was flat with the prior year and down sequentially the sequential performance was driven by lower trading within our core brokerage business partially offset by higher transition management revenue other operating income totaled million and was down from one year ago and down sequentially net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million in the second quarter down from one year ago and down sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our corporate institutional services business fees totaled million and were up yearoveryear and down sequentially favorable currency translation benefited total cis fees on a yearoveryear basis by approximately points custody and fund administration fees were million and up yearoveryear and up on a sequential basis both the yearoveryear and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business with a yearoveryear comparison also benefiting from currency translation assets under custody and administration for cis clients were trillion at quarter end up yearover year and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential growth were driven by favorable markets and new business with currency translation also a benefit in the yearoveryear comparison investment management fees in cis of million were down yearoveryear and down sequentially higher money market fund fee waivers were the key driver of both declines partially offset by favorable markets and new business fee waivers in cis totaled million in the second quarter compared to million in the prior quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 assets under management for cis were trillion up yearoveryear and up sequentially the growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets client flows and favorable currency translation the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and net flows securities lending fees were million down yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear decline was primarily driven by lower spreads partially offset by higher volumes while the sequential performance was driven by higher spreads and volumes average collateral levels were up yearoveryear and up sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million and were up compared to the prior year and up from the prior quarter fee waivers in wealth management totaled million in the current quarter compared to million in the prior quarter across the regions both the yearoveryear and sequential growth were impacted by favorable markets and new business partially offset by higher fee waivers within global family office the favorable impact of markets and new business were offset by higher fee waivers assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarter end up year overyear and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows while the sequential performance primarily reflected favorable markets moving to page net interest income was million in the quarter and was down from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter up versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year while loan balances averaged billion and were up compared to the prior year the net interest margin was in the quarter and was down basis points from a year ago the net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet on a sequential quarter basis net interest income declined average earning assets and average deposits each increased on a sequential basis while average loan balances were up the net interest margin declined basis points sequentially primarily due to lower average rates turning to page expenses were billion in the second quarter and were higher than the prior year and flat with the prior quarter the current quarter included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits category this charge represented approximately points of yearoveryear and sequential growth the yearoveryear comparison for expenses was also unfavorably impacted by currency translation by approximately points of growth compensation expense totaled million and was up compared to the prior year and was down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by higher cashbased incentive accruals as well as higher salaries the growth in salaries was primarily attributable to unfavorable currency translation the sequential decline was primarily due to the prior quarters equity incentives including million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff excluding the previously mentioned pension settlement charge employee benefits expense was up from one year ago and down sequentially the yearoveryear increase was primarily relating to higher medical expense while the sequential decline was due to lower payroll withholding partially offset by higher medical expense outside services expense was million and was up from a year ago and up from the prior quarter revenue and business volume expenses accounted for nearly twothirds of the yearoveryear growth and nearly northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 half of this sequential growth the remaining growth within the category included higher technical services consulting and legal expense reflecting investment in the business as well as the timing of engagements equipment and software expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth reflected higher software support and amortization costs occupancy expense of million were down from a year ago and up sequentially the prior year included costs associated with our workplace real estate strategies other operating expense of million was down from one year ago and down sequentially the year overyear decline was driven by lower miscellaneous expenses including account servicing activities mutual fund coadministration costs and supplemental compensation plan expense the sequential decline was due to lower miscellaneous expense partially offset by higher business promotion and staff related costs and turning to page our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach flat with the prior quarter our tier leverage ratio is up slightly from in the prior quarter during the second quarter we repurchased  of common stock at a cost of million we also declared cash dividends of per share totaling million to common stockholders the current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients needs and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise theyve come to expect from us our competitive positioning across each of our businesses wealth management asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace so thank you again for participating in northern trust second quarter earnings conference call today mike mark lauren and i would be happy to answer your questions stephanie will you please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question so maybe ill start with expenses and was hoping jason you could unpack some of the trends both on the comp and noncomp side of the equation and i guess on the comp side when we look at the sequential decline in compensation almost all of that was really just kind of explained by the seasonal effects so comp was pretty wellcontrolled especially in the context of i guess better revenue environment so how should we think about that for the rest of the year are there things that would is there enough for you guys to kind of hold the line on the expenses for the second half and then similarly on the noncomp side of things things were i guess a little bit higher than originally expected and you previewed that at a conference a few weeks ago but similar line of question kind of how should we think about the jumping off points for the noncomp side of the equation jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so let me take them in order i think you hit the comp walking into this period well in that it was controlled you look at head count in particular alex and thats flat for the second quarter in a row which evidences how weve been managing through the announcements we made in january about what we were trying to do and part of that is that we also look to reinvest some of that savings which maybe plays into the second part of your question which ill come to in a second but in terms of thinking forward for the rest of the year part of what we did was go through that expense savings exercise earlier in the year we talked about million to million somewhere in that range of savings weve gotten through that and executed that pretty well at this point not saying that were going to continue to see a downward trajectory now i think frankly the business growth and some of the investments were making in the business might cause that to start to have more of a traditional feel going forward so then if i come to the noncomp side and i think the area youre probably looking at alex is probably outside services i mean weve got a theres a million increase sequentially there and we did talk about that i did reference that that line item was going to be higher than anticipated and so it probably make sense for me to unpack that a little bit for the group and the way weve been thinking about it is to separate that outside services category outside service line two categories first theres a lot of businessrelated expenses that are that are in there and so its subcustody thirdparty advisory brokerage clearing market data and those are line items that are going to trend with the growth of the business and about half of the growth that we see sequentially is related to that business growth northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 and you can kind of even litmus test that if thats half of the million you say its about million compare that to the fact that we saw about million in trust fee growth exwaivers and so thats not bad and thats you should expect that when weve got that kind of lift on trust fees youd expect there to be some increase coming in these business related growth exercises and then the second big category theres a lot of our technology cost is within that outside services line and weve been weve had a very consistent goal of strengthening the foundation of technology improving data architecture and our client experience and since were doing well on those head count exercises and markets are up we want to be deliberate and say were going to reinvest some of that savings back into technology and that accounts for about half of that increase now to your question on how should we think about it going forward all that that tech investments not going to continue to grow at million a quarter the components of outside services that relate to technology should actually be flat over the next few quarters and weve got some of the engagements we had with consulting firms and others kind of front load the activities there and so at this point were thinking that component should be flat the other component subcustody thirdparty advisory brokering thats going to continue to trend with the business and in the hindsight i think even thinking back to the charges we talked about in january thats a good example of how weve deployed some of those savings in areas that we talked about to reinvest in technology broadly for the business alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thats super helpful thanks for that and then maybe i can squeeze another followup just around capital return dynamics the buyback was a little bit light this quarter obviously you guys continue to have very strong capital ratios and weve seen your peers talk about the willingness to sort of go even a little bit below their internal set of management targets because the balance sheets have ballooned as much as they did how does that inform at all your appetite for share repurchases i know you guys kind of think about yourselves relative to peers in that sort of construct as opposed to the absolute sort of vacuum but given the backdrop for share repurchases for both indiscernible curious how youre thinking about yourself jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah no to acknowledge a lot of firms have talked about aggressive share repurchase to us share repurchase is tied to a lot of factors as we think about how to deploy earnings and to keep capital level roughly level weve got to consider dividends which if you consider those kind of predictable then youre managing the two other factors one the capital required to support rwa growth and then lastly share repurchase so if you look at we actually looked at the last five years prepandemic and dividends are interesting theyre consistently about a third of net income and so think about the other twothirds split between supporting rwa growth and share repurchase over that five years coming into the pandemic rwa wasnt changing significantly so the increase that we saw related to rwa growth is just about and that leaves about of our earnings that were redeployed to share repurchase since the start of the health crisis though the relationship between repurchase and retention is actually flipped and so dividends are still roughly a third maybe a little higher but the rise in loans in securities that you see on the balance sheet that leads to an increase in rwa so about half the earnings have been redeployed in the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 form of retention to maintain capital levels and that left about for repurchase thats kind of the narrative the overall lens of how weve gotten to where we are now that is not to say that we wouldnt change our capital levels or that the change in rwa is a longterm phenomenon we could easily see lower rwa levels in a lot of different scenarios that we could predict but that at least explains what happened in the five years prepandemic and the trends you saw there and then how things have changed in the midst of the health crisis and how at this point our share repurchase are light relative to what you saw coming prepandemic alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you very much for taking the questions daniel johansson a absolutely thanks alex operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello thanks hello there good morning so a question on just rate impacts in general flat rates from here were better do we finally see the signs of nim nii and fee waivers bottoming out or is there another level to think about as nonoperating deposits might start declining just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence from here jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah high level i think the band at this point has narrowed a lot and so theres still runoff in the securities portfolio were twothirds of the way through the runoff there and we were still losing about basis points but if we think about the impact of what thats doing its not as significant as it once was and then another component people obviously youve seen ioer up and i think one thing to note there people see weve got about billion in cash but we only have about billion billion billion at the fed and so that translates to million or million a quarter its not that much in lift libor continues to be a big impact and you actually saw libor come down a little bit and went from i think basis points to basis points over the quarter and so all those things together were at least at this point were not talking about million and million and million moves were talking about million million million moves a quarter and theyre offsetting each other largely so i think were in a band where the volumes across the portfolio are going to be the driver of what happens in net interest income northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that i wonder if you could just expand or just comment on the fixed versus floating rate mix of both your debt and in the securities portfolio im just curious if youre just thinking about locking in either side as rates have moved yet again lower jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp no it wouldnt cause us the recent moves wouldnt cause us to make a change were constantly looking out on the market and just thinking broadly about how we feel about it and so we did have duration step out a little bit it went from to and maybe somewhere in that range but thats more reflective of the longer journey weve been on extending the securities portfolio but were conscious to not try and chase return by doing anything inconsistent with what weve talked about strategically and the strategy we talk about at alco has been to get about where we are right now in duration and in mix and so no significant changes that i would want to forecast coming up glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay appreciate it thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you glenn operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning mike good morning jason hi guys can i follow up on the money market mutual fund waiver fees now that there has been a slight increase in rates in the reverse repo area where many in the money market mutual funds are now engaged with the federal reserve do you sense that your money market mutual fund waiver fees could actually decline sequentially some of your peers have pointed that out jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah i think they will unless we get a significant change in the short end of the yield curve but what happened midjune was helpful for waivers and if you think about if you just think about the math of it well first of all ill tell you i can tell you where we were we peaked at a run rate of million to million a quarter and thats where we were early june and now as we sit today the run rate is more like million a quarter and that run rate changed pretty quickly after the fed actions june or whatever it was northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 now that said theres not much i dont think theres that much more thats going to come in terms of run rate and i think at this point because the money market mutual funds are so short and probably of them on average have days or less in duration of portfolio so theyve already turned over and reinvested and so the run rate i gave you is largely reflective of the post ioer and overnight repo facility changes but yes theres a benefit that came from that actions in midjune gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then as a followup youve talked a little bit about your reserves at the fed i think on your balance sheet your total deposits at banks all central banks is around billion if thats the right number can you tell me whats a more normal number once we get into maybe a more normal environment at some point in the future what would be the lower number that youd be comfortable with jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well im not im not sure its lower interestingly we talk a lot about this what is if we layer in the overall deposits on average deposits are forget about just whats at the fed but just in general whats driving the asset levels is the liability side and if were at billion billion is that a post pandemic normal and its just too hard to tell and i think theres clients are right now theyve held on to liquidity longer than what we would have anticipated and that the billion the other billionish thats in billion billion thats in other currencies and other central banks its all driven by the deposit base and its held in there pretty flat for a while now on that billion billion level gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you jason thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure thanks gerard operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question jason curious about the loan growth so that was pretty robust this quarter and actually the end of period higher than the average so certainly suggest it was steady through the quarter can you maybe give some color around whats driving the loan growth and also the decline in the loan yield was that simply a function of libor or was there some mix that was contributing to that as well thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so the loan growth im going to id put it in two buckets one is there has been an ongoing for the last several months for this year and maybe even leading up to it an initiative a desire a deliberate level of activity with clients to explain to them we like the types of loans that we do but were willing to do more of them with those clients and ive talked about being perceived as more of a reluctant lender and so weve been talking to clients saying well do more and so that has been a continued lift to our loan portfolio i think particularly relative to what weve seen in the rest of the industry that said theres also a chunk of it thats more thats probably more episodic and weve talked about the spikiness and the deposits that can come from particularly gfo clients who are very large asset owners and theres an element thats there that we would view as episodic and spiky and thats leading to both the a big part of the increase that you mentioned and also is a driver of the yield but back to the fact that we did see libor come down a couple basis points that obviously is also going to have an impact on the loan portfolio as a whole brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks for that and then thinking about organic growth in the quarter you guys had signaled recently that things were starting to pick back up after being on hold with the pandemic and of the disruption so how did organic growth come in this quarter and when you think about organic growth particularly on the wealth management side do you all typically use metrics that are consistent for wealth management like net new assets in order to gauge that growth and is there any chance that well be getting some disclosure maybe some formal disclosure around those metrics at any point so we can have a better more clear sense of how this business is growing jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well the feel like were revenue numbers by region and also splitting out the family office business and so we can come back to the disclosure element if youd like but just maybe start sequentially with your questions the organic growth across the company was good and it was strong in cis for the quarter we look at that very much yearoveryear its very difficult to try and unpack that on a sequential basis but the cis business has had strong new business growth and thats coming to fruition its being onboarded and were seeing good organic lift in the business and then wealth as you can see is benefiting a lot its more exposed to market growth and so that has been more of a help but there has also been good yearoveryear growth in the wealth management business as well ill also call out in looking at the numbers a little bit deeper that a portion of the growth sequentially in wealth came from what we think of as some nonrecurring items we have those items in cis and we call those out but we also have those in the wealth management business and so that can be trust and estate settlements it can be how we account for alternatives coming onto the income statement not a huge amount but call it million million of the lift that we had nonrecurring in nature but overall it was a good its a very strong organic growth quarter for the enterprise northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color jason jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi mike your opening comment you mentioned the digital strategy and some changes that you made and how thats helping out right now thats a very high level comment and its appreciated but can you connect that to some more concrete metrics on how its actually impacting the results that were seeing and maybe will impact the results ahead michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so i think with digital mike theres a number of ways to look at it but to start with the reference in my opening comments there particularly in wealth management a lot of this is as ive talked previously about switching from a new business generation model that has historically been primarily ill call it either inperson or onthephone if you will to be more digital and so when i talked about the navigate the now campaign that was essentially or driven by an online digital campaign and the key to it was that how do we generate more opportunities from that so leads from that and so both with what was online it was supported then with some more traditional media through advertisements that generated thousands of leads for us at a high level which then have been worked through to get to the leads that fit our profile and then could be followed up ill call it in a more traditional way in doing that the other one ill mention mike that i referred to is the tax policy resource center which is part of the northern trust institute and while we talk a lot about that is our knowledge base that we leverage for our clients but its also a significant new business generation asset and the reason why thats also digital specifically to your point is when we launched that center which essentially is online then that has generated significant new leads so just with that policy resource center since it has been launched weve had over views of that and then from that that gives us the data if you will to then follow up with those that are going to the center and again that doesnt mean that of them will be good leads but its the funnel which you then work those through down to ultimately being new clients so when i mentioned digital that was the reference on that front and then to your point more broadly with what were doing just with digitalizing our entire business thats much broader with regard to our technological capabilities that drive both new capabilities for clients but also efficiencies for our business model mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 and on that last point when you talk about efficiencies for the business model is there any way you can size the potential your aspirational targets lowering unit costs improving the fees with expense relationship any kind of context you can put around that michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so as you know and you highlighted it there theres a number of financial metrics but one that weve looked to which is the expenses the trust fees and weve continued to drive that down over time and i do think at a high level financial perspective thats where youre going to see it come through and just to try to make that more tangible so one of our big investments in asset servicing is in our matrix platform that first is focused on transfer agency and so with it yes it will provide a much better experience for our clients clients right because were doing that on behalf of asset manager clients but also that is going to yield significant efficiencies for us essentially thats the first ill call it funding mechanism for the business plan to make that investment and then the other of course is generating new business because of the capabilities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc audio gap with regards to the outlook jason i was hoping you could speak to whats driving just some of the increased loan appetite in the current environment i know you talked about really strong growth in demand across our client base but i was hoping you could provide just some context around how much was seasonality a factor that maybe drove this stepup given some of the tax seasonality and just the implications for the nii trajectory in the back half whether theres a sufficient offset to the securities yield headwind that you had cited earlier in your remarks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp not a lot theres not a lot of seasonality on the loan side for us at all some on deposits but not on the loans and so what i was talking about earlier is there may be a layer there thats less about seasonality but more about northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 just the spikiness of how some of our very very large clients will sometimes come to us and say we want to borrow very large dollar amount to either avoid selling a large asset avoid the public sale of large assets and were happy those are extremely highquality loans and theyre meaningful to clients to help on their liquidity needs but you can also imagine pricing on them isnt something thats driving incredible increase in nii either and so i dont think that i think it probably sticks out more in volume levels than it will in nii levels over time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just for my followup also on nii i was hoping to get a sense as to how youre thinking about managing some of the excess liquidity thats parked at the fed you saw a very healthy stepup not surprisingly sequentially and the securities growth has been relatively tepid as excess reserves have continued to expand i want to get a sense as to whether you have sufficient excess liquidity or buffer some of those incremental funds back into securities jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah weve got a lot of weve got plenty of room right now if we wanted to move from whether its hqla or nonhqla whether we wanted to increase the balance sheet size of clients were the driver there and saying we wanted to do significant increases again we havent were not incredibly receptive to the phone calls from organizations we dont work with saying can we park billion to billion on the balance sheet weve always talked about the balance sheet being there for our clients and being a strategic resource for us engaging with our clients but at this point we feel like weve got a lot of flexibility i think you look at tier leverage of and that gives an indication in and of itself of tens of billions of dollars of room that we could have to bring on additional assets and then in terms of how we would deploy it theres also plenty of room we have to move between hqla and nonhqla based on what we see as attractive in the market and the risk profile that were looking at across the different asset classes that we invest in steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great color thanks for taking my questions michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi beth northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a couple questions on some of the initiatives that youve announced recently in particular the european etf launch and the alternative asset servicing digitization initiative maybe you could give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the rollout the timing the impact is it likely to come through earnings in the next couple of years or is this client acquisition over time type of initiative jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp id headline both is longterm strategically important but shortterm not needlemoving from the income statement perspective and take for example the european etf just weve got billion in aum in overall assets mostly in europe related to esg and weve got a nice business in europe when it comes to dealing with esg and fund launches and so thats a good example of us thinking about whats important for our clients and working with the asset management business to determine what they can do to provide incremental resources for clients long term you think about the size of trillion in assets and aum in the asset management business and thats not something that we think is going to be a needle mover to that trillion but also strategically really important i dont know mike if you have anything you want to add michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp and betsy to address the other one it fits into my comments on digitalization and the fact that the first driver often is the efficiencies that we get from it so what we announced there on the alternative asset side is the ability to use machine learning in order to essentially capture all the data for alternative assets and digitize them if you will so that then they can be much more efficiently processed through the entire process and so something that will benefit us on the efficiency and productivity side betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just separately obviously equity markets are up nicely were hearing about a lot of pension plans that are looking to get frozen and put into the hands of ocio providers i know youre involved in that business could you give us a sense as to how you believe youre positioned for what seems like is a wave of opportunity here jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah yeah youre right i mean were in that business and in a good way and we if you think about particularly north america pension plans our ocio business is and im a little indiscernible on the numbers but it was at one point within the last few years we were the leader in that space and so it falls into our sweet spot well weve got very good expertise very sophisticated client base particularly on the db side of the ocio market now the flipside to it is you get a lot of clients who as they derisk and do other things with their portfolios that can sometimes work against you and so i dont think about it as a big wave that again is going to move the needle on billion in fees but thats a very strategically important business for us where weve done extremely well over time with high quality clients and a very talented team and so when theres money in motion there for firms to be thinking about outsourcing their db plans i think were very wellpositioned northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah i would just add betsy because we do believe were particularly wellpositioned for that trend because in addition to what jason said if you think about our business model you have the ocio practice that jason talked about but also we have relationships through wealth management and through the family office part of that as well where we have exposure and connections into a number of foundations that might not be as large as some of the biggest that you read about but are going through the same decision making of whether they want to just outsource the investment activity there and we think that will continue and we think again we cover it i would say as broadly as anybody betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks and then just one squeezein question on the dividend i know we talked earlier about the buyback but should we be expecting any changes to the dividend going forward jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well if you look over the last few years particularly pre2020 was just kind of goofy year but our dividend is pretty consistently to of net income and its been very consistent and if you look at where this quarter falls it falls right in the middle of that to range and so nothing there that would raise a flag up or down we think its very attractive and we also interestingly i think something people dont do a lot we look at dividends relative to rwa which is an interesting way to combine thinking about payout ratio with returns so as we look at our peers and you can pick your own but both in terms of that the level of that payout ratio on a percent basis relative to earnings the consistency of it and also how it is relative to rwa which again gets to both returns and payout relative to the peers that we look at we scored really well on those different lenses betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp ken kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 hi good morning just a follow up on that point on capital further i just want to make sure im clear that it seems like youre focusing as much on just maintaining capital ratios with that balancing act you mentioned on rwa versus the combined shareholder return so i know you guys dont give us formal targets but i think historically i might have thought you might have lived relative to where the others are is this a little bit of difference maybe its postpandemic or maybe its a you want to keep some aside for inorganic opportunities just wondering like just how we think about how northern trust thinks about your absolute capital in that regard i understand the mix of usage has changed but coming back to just like where you want to live on absolute levels thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure and ken its mike i think you hit on the key factors and how those do change over time so to your point you said well the pandemic and how you may feel about that criteria is the operating environment so were always looking at that operating environment determining where we think we need to be the second i would say is certainly from a regulatory perspective and again we feel very good about where we are there but thats another lens to make sure that we think were in the right place visàvis all the ratios and the whole ccar process and everything and then third as you mentioned indiscernible absolute its the relative capital ratios which we know that that is a part of the considerations that clients have when they think about a financial partner a partner that they need to trust not just today to be around and be strong but be around for a very very long time i mean thats part of the pitch if you will ken is that northern trust has been around and will be around through all types of environments and that we have amongst all the capabilities but we also have the financial strength and capitalization so thats why that criteria is important and to your point that can change over time as our peers move their capital levels up and down kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay its just would seem to me that you got plenty of capacity on all of those factors plus room for balance sheet growth plus room for buybacks but it just seems like the mix of the buyback has become a smaller proportion obviously as we saw this quarter michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah it did but as jason went through weve just gone through in the last six quarters a meaningful increase in rwa largely intentional if you will as jason talked about where we saw that opportunity to really support clients and to get prospects that would not just be credit clients but broader relationships and so we saw that as a better opportunity at that time to redeploy in the business and rwa went up as he said more in the six quarters than it did in the five previous years in a meaningful way does that stay the same going forward obviously we dont know but generally speaking these things tend to change over time kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc very fair thank you mike and just one question on deposit growth which has remained stickier as you guys have mentioned are you comfortable housing it all on balance sheet even though youre getting relatively low returns in the low rate environment or do you contemplate trying to move some of it off into offbalance sheet vehicles northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp we can start in that instance with whats best for clients and weve got billion in money market fund family and the performance there is good its a very attractive set of money market mutual funds at the same time some clients really like the saying we want to be on the balance sheet and some of it is geographic obviously in the us theres much more prevalence to use funds where some of our european clients like to use the balance sheet more i think were in a good position where weve got room on both sides leally good attractive offerings on both sides dont need to nudge clients one way or another for us that said we sometimes look in different operating environments we can about pricing we can think about the value proposition that we can offer clients in one platform versus another and we can have conversations with them about that and do things but not in a position at this point to have to nudge again thats in this environment where all bank balance sheets are inflated it gives us a lot of room to be able to just lead with what makes the most sense for large sophisticated depositors kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks guys jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking the questions just let me jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc come back into the capital question since the buybacks and dividends have caught everybodys attention following up on your comment that you do do it with versus you watch versus peers and that youre focused on the riskweighted assets so that would imply that youre focused on the cet1 ratio versus peers is it a gap what is the gap that youre trying to maintain above peers is it basis points is it basis points can you give us some sense of sort of as we think about how do in the constructs of your balance sheet whatever assumptions we make what is it that we should be keeping in mind jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 yeah theres no gap in particular and thats not even i also wouldnt say thats the only ratio that we look cet1 were looking at weve talked about tier leverage a few times just this morning on this call and there are other things that we look at as well in terms of the balance sheet strength and what are credit quality and other factors and how all that duration and what exposure is like to interest rate risk and so theres a lot of ways to litmus test that and then at the same time weve also mentioned and mike just walked through the framework a few minutes ago were thinking not just about the relative but at an absolute level where we want to be and thinking about what the regulatory environment is like and then i always remind people that were not just making this decision unilaterally internally we have really good engaged conversations with our board around this topic as well on where we might want to be where we might want to take the balance sheet strategically and so i know its tempting to kind of look and say okay well whats the floor and where are you going but theres so many factors that were looking at and also whats the reinvestment opportunity set look like and if weve got opportunities to let rwa grow in ways that we think are building the future earnings and thats what i think some people can miss is that the rwa growth isnt just a drag that theoretically should give you should give a sense that theres potential future earnings thats expected and were still were trying to grow earnings and so looking at dividends and share repurchase i think can sometimes take it pull that narrative toward thinking about those things is the better way to redeploy earnings but the rwa growth is reflective in some ways over the long run of the base of business that we have now again its not to say that we think rwa is going to continue to increase it could come down even mentioning the loan growth weve talked about is something that had a significant increase in rwa this period if that goes away in a year then the rwa would come down and so theres so many factors that when we sit around the table and talk about where do we want to go with redeployment of earnings weve got to try and predict not just where things are but where things are going at each of these elements but its certainly broader than thinking about a specific gap on cet1 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay great and one more on as you look at your overall expenses youve told us that the other operating expenses what do you expect the trajectory to be are you seeing any other impact from an inflationary standpoint any color on that given the big talk in the environment about inflation what are you able to do to offset that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i think we missed the operative word there are we looking to see any changes and what did you say to that vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc from the rise in inflation are you seeing any inflation increase impacting your expenses jason and if so how you either what are you do being able to do to offset that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 thanks for clarifying and then just another component of the question the comments we made earlier werent on other expenses it was on outside services just to make sure everybody understands what we were talking about in detail there but the inflation is showing up in different areas i mean every firm is dealing with talent issues and the pressure is there we certainly see that and experience it and talking at management levels about how to address it and the inflation we see across the business and different areas as well and some of it is unit costs but some of it is just the increased cost of doing business and we talked about the significant increase in technology oriented expenses that were having in some ways thats an inflation cost on the business its not just a unit price inflation but its inflation in the overall cost of doing business so its showing up in different ways across the organization michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah i would just add vivek if you think about it in a manufacturing context to jasons point were seeing inflation on the cost side in a number of ways in the manufacturing context your question will be are you able to pass that on to the end consumer and thats not the way our operating model is set up that said if you think about generally how were pricing what we do a lot of it relates to the asset level so to the extent that that inflation is going through to aum auc levels youre capturing some of it there and then also to the extent that you believe that theres inflation on the horizon as well you would expect the interest rates to go up as well and we know where we are on rates and what the impact would be to the extent that those increase vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you both jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe just to come back on the seasonal expenses in the second half you gave us the color on the outside service expense typically you see a seasonal bump in equipment and software expense that has been pretty reliable at least over last three years so if you could just maybe comment on whether we expect to see that similar dynamic and then in other expenses just i dont know if i missed it but the northern trust open is that is going to be a factor for northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks for bringing up the equipment and software price i should have referenced that earlier yeah there would likely be an increase there as we think about whats happening over the remainder of the year and its not one or two areas that i could point you to but its just youre right there are some dynamics where that tends to tick up some of the expenses that we some of the capital expenses that we put in place you start to see depreciation come up there and its in a lot of different line items but there should be a tick up there a normalish or maybe even slightly above that increase in equipment software and then in terms of golf i dont know mike do you want to take that if you want michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp it will be in their third quarter mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah and brian this is mark i mean you could look at the business promotional line even though thats not all the golf but theres seasonality to it and if you looked at it through there was about a million to million stepup from second to third quarter so thats probably a decent way to think about it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thats helpful jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i think last quarter brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp last year as we came in we were wondering whether because of the pandemic those numbers would be lower and i think everybody should be thinking about it as more of a normal year so mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp the numbers are marked throughout it it will be the one thing thats important for people to take away jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp right northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right right okay yeah really makes sense and then maybe just on esg just back to that twopart question you mentioned i think mike you mentioned that the esg vector score that you launched i think thats for asset owners if im not mistaken i guess the question there is that something that you are charging for separately or more built into the overall service offering and then on the wealth side are you seeing demand from your wealth clients increasingly to invest in investment with social responsibility and are you meeting that through your own investment management or other open architecture managers on the platform michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so yes we are seeing the demand brian kind of across the fronts that you talked about so let me just give a little more detail to it first of all with our asset servicing clients to your point as they invest more in esg they need the analytics and data and reporting to support that and so we are providing that type of service to them and one of the examples that i mentioned earlier the marks spencer mandate that we had in the quarter was for that service just as an example and then with wealth management absolutely our client base is interested in esg and increasing their investable assets in that area and as much as we have an open architecture model with wealth management much of it is serviced through ntam and so weve seen the benefit of that in ntam and ntam on its own or in addition on the institutional side is seeing that demand and fulfilling it as well and so just to put some numbers on that our esg assets in ntam now are at about billion which is up over from a year ago so healthy growth in that area and its an area of focus for us as a company brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay thats great color thank you michael g
