all those on the frontlines who are battling this crisis every day before i discuss this quarters performance i would like to cover topics with you these two topics first i would like to share with you some of the actions we have taken across the bank to deal with covid19 crisis it goes without saying that the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and shareholders is of the utmost importance to management and the board of directors the company was very proactive during the very early stages of the crisis and immediately enacted a business continuity plan and pandemic preparedness procedures by midmarch close to of our bank office employees were working remotely in addition we temporarily closed all of our instore branches along with several other locations converted some to driveup only and adjusted the hours at our remaining branches on the consumer side we have enhanced our online banking and mobile capabilities temporarily waive certain retail banking fees for those customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties during this time and offered 90day payment forbearance to residential mortgage customers new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 on the commercial side we have proactively reached out to borrowers on a casebycase basis to help them manage through this crisis as well we put in place several risk mitigation strategies including enhanced monitoring of certain credit payment restructuring plans and deferral options consistent with regulatory guidance second i would like to clear up some misperceptions regarding trends in the rentregulated multifamily market in new york city we are not a newcomer to this market if you recall at this point we have been doing this type of lending for over years we have relationships with some of the largest property owners in the city and we have very strong ties to some of the biggest commercial real estate brokers including the largest one servicing the new york city marketplace we also have a as directors several real estate professionals who participate in this market for a living providing us with a unique perspective on the multifamily market over the past week or so there has been some discussions about the level of rent collections in our market with our conservative view on underwriting we closely monitor a number of trends in the multifamily market and when things change we reevaluate during the month of april we surveyed a wide gamut of our borrowers including some of our top borrowers we spoke to brokers and we also reached out to a number of industry experts based on our market intelligence april rent collections on the rentregulated buildings in our portfolio are estimated to be in a range of to on the market rent properties it is even higher this is very encouraging given the impact on the new york city area given the covid19 pandemic while there are still many uncertainties regarding how covid19 crisis will ultimately unfold to what degree it will impact the economy over the long run we believe that we are better positioned than most other financial institutions to navigate through it given our strong credit culture and low operating model while no two economic cycles are alike i would impress upon you the fact that throughout various cycles our actual loan loss experience has been much lower than the rest of the industry with that out of the way lets turn to our quarterly results earlier this morning we reported diluted earnings per common share of for the three months ended march thats up compared to the yearago quarter and ahead of consensus estimates despite what is usually a seasonally slower quarter we had strong loan growth a higher level of net interest income and net interest margin expansion lower operating expenses and stable asset quality metrics we enacted the first quarter with positive underlying momentum and we are a strong capital and liquidity position our results include a provision for credit losses of million thats far below industry metrics due to the application of cecl during the quarter this reflects an additional reserve for the potential impact of covid19 this was slightly offset by an income tax benefit due to certain provisions under the cares act that notwithstanding we are very pleased with our first quarter performance we entered the year with strong fundamentals building off of a solid performance in the fourth quarter of last year one of the highlights of the quarter is the improvement in both net interest income and the margin after reaching an inflection point last quarter when these two metrics both increased for the first time in five years they increased again during the quarter the current quarter net interest income excluding the impact of prepayment activity increased million or on an annualized basis compared to the previous quarter due to lower interest expense as funding cost continued to decline the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 net interest margin also continued its upward trajectory also excluding the impact from prepayment income the first quarter margin would have been up basis points and in line with expectations we are currently very wellpositioned for further growth throughout in both the margin and net interest income albeit at a higher rate than we experienced during the current quarter this is due to our liabilitysensitive balance sheet the fed having lowered its target rate to near zero and the significant repricing opportunities embedded within our funding mix especially on the cd side we also reported a strong increase in preprovision net revenue ppnr was million for the first quarter up million or compared to the yearago quarter on the expense front total noninterest expense was million down from a yearago quarter the efficiency ratio in the first quarter was and continues to reflect positive operating leverage moving on to the balance sheet despite the usual beginningofyears seasonality federal loans increased almost million or on an annualized basis compared to the fourth quarter specialty finance lending and multifamily portfolio continue to be the primary drivers of this growth the specialty finance business had strong growth this quarter this portfolio rose million to billion on a linkedquarter basis meanwhile the multifamily portfolio increased million to billion sequentially as i alluded to earlier given all that has transpired over the last two months multifamily credit spreads have widened significantly due to market dislocation and less competition similar to what has occurred in previous cycles origination activity was also strong as overall originations increased on a yearoveryear basis to billion with both multifamily and specialty finance originations increasing significantly compared to the yearago quarter first quarter originations exceeded last quarters pipeline by billion or multifamily originations were billion and specialty finance originations were million both up relative to first quarter of last year we continue to be encouraged by our potential loan growth over the course of this year our pipeline currently stands at billion higher than the fourth quarter and yearago pipeline of the billion approximately is new money on the funding side our deposit growth continued into the first quarter as well total deposits rose million or annualized to billion most of this growth was in lower cost savings and noninterestbearing checking accounts while of cds declined modestly wholesale borrowings also increased as we took advantage of the low interest rate environment to replace matured borrowings with lower cost longer duration borrowings borrowings increased million to billion during the current quarter on the asset quality side as discussed in more detail in our earnings release we reported a million provision for credit losses mainly driven by covid19 net chargeoffs totaled million or of average loans million of which was taxi medallionrelated loans that portfolio continues to be in runoff mode and currently stands at million importantly we had no losses in our core portfolio the adoption of cecl did not have a material impact on our asset quality metrics as they remained strong during the quarter nonperforming assets declined million or to million compared to the level at year end or basis points of total assets as with chargeoffs the largest component of npas is taxi medallion loans excluding taxi medallionrelated loans npas would have been million or basis points of total assets as noted in todays investor presentation billion or of our total multifamily portfolio is subject to new york state rent regulation laws the weighted average ltv on this piece of the portfolio is compared to for the overall multifamily portfolio unchanged from the previous quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 lastly we also announced that the board of directors declared a cash dividend per common share for the quarter the dividend will be payable on may to common shareholders of record as of may based on yesterdays closing price this represents an annualized dividend yield of before moving on to your questions i would like to make a final comment at nycb we are not just a community bank we are a family and when things get difficult our family comes together i am extremely proud of all the efforts everyone every employee has made to ensure that we

collective thank you to all of our employees throughout our franchise lastly our prayers go out to all those members of the nycb family past and present who are suffering from covid19 and particularly those employees their families and friends who have lost due to disease on that note i would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions we will do our best to get to all of you within the remaining time but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or this week question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc good morning everyone so i guess just to follow up your comments about the multifamily indiscernible i guess my sense is well probably see an uptick in rent deferrals when we look at the may week data so those numbers probably go from to to something lower so would love to get your thoughts on that and additionally if you can talk about the strength of your customer base given as the ltv is in the low whats the risk in terms of from a credit standpoint to nyb and what level of payment deferrals have you provided to your clients in the last month or so joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc tom do you want to take that thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah sure so ebrahim good morning its tom cangemi joe can address the market but ill clearly give you the specifics on what weve done with our customers we were very quick to react to obviously this pandemic indiscernible to support the customer base so we offered right out of the in midmarch when the government shut down the country the ability for customers to come to us and defer for a period of four six new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 months and part of that deferral was they have to be current at the time theyve entered into a deferral agreement and they have to be also paying their escrow payments throughout that period that being said we actually as of yesterday which is indiscernible may we have approximately billion of multi or of the entire multi portfolio thats in a deferral agreement if you think about the entire portfolio and add to it cre its approximately billion and the cre piece of that i believe is approximately billion in total percentage of the cre is approximately so allin its about of multifamily cre of billion and the ltv of that portfolio thats on deferral is ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc and thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and thats as of yesterday so thats in a realtime ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc and its a 90day deferral to loan like what is like is your expectation thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats a 6month deferral indiscernible ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc and if we start seeing these lockdowns kind of open up lets call it somewhere around in june july is your sense that most of these borrowers or all of these borrowers will go back to being current coming looking out into third quarter towards the end of the year thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so ebrahim i dont have a crystal ball but i can give you actual specific collections as of yesterday were looking at when you take into account the deferrals as well as people that have indiscernible up to of april collections compared to all of the previous months around the same level when you back out deferral so the multifamily thats at versus so were really not seeing a significant adjustment here on payment on payments coming through so were very pleased on the current collection effort that is going on as of yesterday ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc understood and just moving away from multifamily to anything when you look at the other cre book i think cre retail is obviously under the scanner or just talk to us in terms of the risk exposure there particularly to any new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 more retail high end and also if any risk on the specialty finance book which has grown a lot over the last couple of years thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure so obviously the percentage of deferral is higher for commercial real estate in particular looking at retail and office and alike so we expected that especially on the mixed use properties indiscernible the highest percentage will be the mixed use properties where you have smaller buildings that have a higher concentration of retail on the ground floor and you have residential above that that number is in probably in the percentile when you think about pure well call it pure retail and office for office and professional buildings and retail is at when you blend that those numbers in for the portfolio its but clearly the higher level is going to be as expected theres no revenue coming in in the ground floor on the multi side we happen to have some very interesting statistics the larger the buildings the much lower the amount of deferral so the buildings that have in excess of 100plus families living in the building thats like a deferral rate so its much lower so its type versus the retail which is could be substantially higher because theres no revenue coming through on specialty finance i would tell you that as we stand right now everything is current and no missed payments we feel pretty confident on the portfolio given our senior security and our position and weve been growing that portfolio very nicely and again were an assetbased lender we feel that we dont have significant exposure thats covid related we do have some energy couple hundred million dollars in energy but thats all super senior secured to very stable institutions and on the auto side which is dealer floor plan we believe that portfolio will do well given the ppp program as well as the ability to get up and running towards the end of the year with the with their option to take on deferrals and eventually get these dealerships open up again so we think that that portfolio we should have zero losses in the specialty finance business ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc got it thats helpful and just one separately and last one on the margin so you have a ton of like funding coming up for refi just talk to us in terms of the new deposit rates offered and if you can provide some cadence of the interest rate backdrop if it stays where it is given the spread widening on the lending side like what level of margin expansion should we expect between now indiscernible quarter or if you can talk to just the next few quarters like what is the level of margin we expect to the end thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure sure so id say big picture as we talked about going back to we said theres an inflection point in the fourth quarter the margins start to rise in q4 with the anticipation seeing significant rise as we go into with the exception of a substantial adjustments in interest rates obviously the fed has intervened here indiscernible close to a near zero fed fund rate with that being said we did hit our guidance for q1 as expected up to but when you think about second quarter margin well see more likely than not doubledigit margin expansion we believe that throughout we anticipate double digit every quarter so were going to have substantial margin expansion given our liability new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 sensitivity balance sheet and more importantly we have substantial amount of cds coming due as you can see from the press release we put the numbers out there its approximately billion coming due in the second quarter its billion coming due at a and in the event that you have a cd rolling off in this environment youre going to end up in a probably more likely than not a level well below basis points so i think when you think about the potential there billion in q2 q3 is almost billion at these rates are coming down well below so the margin is really going to be driven by a number of factors we have the cd cost dropping materially funding cost is dropping on the borrowings side if you look at where borrowings are right now on twoyear bullets at basis points with a swap its close to effectively zero and you think about the money coming due on the borrowing side and if were growing the portfolio depending on how we grow with deposits and our borrowings the cost is relatively cheap but more importantly theres been a real change in pricing in respect to the multifamily cre space i mean no question that theres been some dislocation with cmbs players are on the sidelines you have the agencies tightening up their standards so were looking at north of basis points increase in our product mix so if you were to come to the bank today indiscernible an atype credit fiveyear structure our typical bread andbutter structure youre at a coupon thats pretty attractive compared to where fiveyear treasuries are trading at right now so were very bullish about the economic spreads on the product mix were extremely bullish on the drop in the cost of funds so we can see doubledigit margin expansion every quarter throughout and that will be assuming credit costs are in ph shack youre looking at eps growth in the mid teens ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning brock operator brock please check to see if your phone is muted brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc oops sorry joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning brock new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning could you kind of dive into the multifamily credit spreads i think we all saw the dislocation in march it seemed like the gses kind of pulled themselves out of the market why doesnt this mean revert and how much of that aggressive margin guide is based on the current pricing holding thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so again we dont have a crystal ball what happens with interest rates but clearly it seems like rates are going to stay low for a while here given the pandemic and the circumstances so we have in our run rate indiscernible well just talk about fed not doing anything in at the same time weve been through many crisis and cycles and weve seen adjustments within the marketplace and clearly go back to the adjustment you had massive dislocation you had cmbs you had the agency out of business back then so its it doesnt indiscernible say that the agency is out of business but the agency has clearly tightened their standards they have widened their spreads there is a premium riskreward thats priced in the marketplace and were enjoying that healthier spread i think whats most important here when you talk about asset growth were anticipating net loan growth but were seeing substantial favorable results on retention as we ended up the quarter so as we go into q2 we think our retention level will be higher and we have well over or billion in next two years coming due from our own customer base so we believe we will retain a high percentage of that unlike we did last year so i think the fact that the competition has waned significantly basispoint spread with funding costs coming down to zero it can be a very powerful margin expansion story here at nycb brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and you were going through these numbers very quickly could you just review again the cre and multi family forbearance percentage thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure billion as of yesterday that weve entered into agreements on forbearance for multifamily billion for cre which is office and retail predominantly on a percentage basis thats in total multi on cre ltv in the total portfolio is of that deferral brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from steve moss with b riley fbr please proceed new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc all right good morning joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc on the loan growth here just wanted to see youre talking about a pretty strong pipeline here any thoughts any updated thoughts around total loan growth here for the year thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so joe do you want to handle that one joe joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i think the idea here is that as always is the case when the market is stressed we get a greater share of the market we do believe that well be growing our loans at least at the levels of last year and well likely in excess of the levels of last year so the important thing is that in this crisis our principal asset will greatly outperform and our ability to take share of the marketplace will increase both of those factors have always been the case in a stressed environment we do believe that the period ahead will represent an environment where many of the other lenders in our niche will lend less and we will lend more thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc steve i will indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc some color on our projections obviously were projecting in midsingle digits which is were pretty bullish about the pipeline and more importantly going back to my dialogue as far as retention it feels like our team has done a phenomenal job on really conveying that were really fighting for that retention so we moved that retention rates back up to the historical norms what typically will happen when a lot of competition is waning we should see the potential as joe indicated of higher growth but for conservative purposes we feel comfortable that net loan growth is reasonable for the company and i think this year youll probably see more on the multifamily side than youll still have strong growth on the specialty but multifamily should be backloaded here especially in q2 obviously q2 is usually a strong quarter for us steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 great and then just in terms of underwriting standards here any changes as youre getting new customers approaching the bank thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so i would add that we have made some changes obviously given the marketplace weve tightened the standards in particular when cash money refi coming out of a transaction we feel that we have a lot more flexibility now given the marketplace so were actually when we do a transaction with a cashout type refi were actually holding six months of both pi and escrow payments in escrow with the bank so thats one of the major changes weve done in this environment and obviously you can imagine that when the environment gets tighter were one of the tightest underwriters in the marketplace so were going to continue to be there for our customers but were going to be there at a very conservative level and thats the hallmark of the company steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc great and then on funding costs here interestbearing deposit costs down basis points i hear you in terms of significant repricing just wondering if you could put a little bit more in terms of what you would expect this quarter versus the first quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so i would say the continuation of substantial declines in deposit cost is real we have a unique situation going in particular were in the epicenter so its very difficult to go out to the branch and change your deposits when cds are coming due so many people are just very comfortable for safety reasons keeping their cash in the bank now that being said thats people that were at last year or are going down to close to basis points today until they come back to the branch and or make a phone call and try to get a higher rate and my guess is that given where the marketplace is youre looking at rates indiscernible probably be south of basis points for between or 2yeartype period we do have an offering now but theres no real takers on that type of coupon at to basis points but the reality is were going to be continuing lowering our rates unless theres a change in the market because were looking at close to interest rates and being a thrift were very stable when it comes to targeting some spread off of the us treasury which is at a very low rate so we feel highly confident that the substantial amount of coming due of billion in particular q2 billion in the middle of the epicenter at will drop materially lower for us steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc great and then just on the energy exposure that you just mentioned tom you said a couple hundred million in energy senior secured just wondering what type of loan it is and indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc its equipment for schlumberger is our largest client there its theyre a household name large institution weve been lending to them for multiple years since we started the business and theyve drawdown on some facilities but its all super senior secured and we have it at a pretty high rated on a scale i think its indiscernible its a high rated internally classified asset however we feel highly confident that its money good new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 and in particular its a household name that has very strong fundamentals and more importantly its super senior secured so its not a loan to schlumberger the corporation but its on its equipment steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc great thank you very much thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator our next question is from collyn gilbert with kbw please proceed joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning gentlemen first question just on the pipeline really strong pipeline obviously this quarter do you have a sense of sort of how thats going to behave going into tom i know you just mentioned you expect strong loan growth in but just curious kind of where youre what your borrower behavior is how closings are getting done so maybe what the pull through rate is on that pipeline and then also what the blended rate is on that pipeline indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so let me hit the easy one first the blended rates about as of yesterday but if you think about how it evolved when you go to the end of the quarter spreads widen out materially we started with the rent regulatory changes in last year when we went from to basis points because of the change in the rent control market and then we hit the pandemic now were north of so it really was a change in the marketplace towards the backend of the quarter so this is more of an evolving pipeline that were going to see throughout the year but the business that were out there getting good flows of opportunity right now within our own portfolio and others as you indicated our new money pipeline is about youre seeing a much higher coupon relevant to the current the one i just cited at its going to take some time to work through the bank but clearly weve never i dont think weve ever closed last time what weve announced in our pipeline i cant remember ever where we announced the pipeline we didnt close it at a minimum our pipeline so were looking at a billion pipeline in q2 so indiscernible close that and some collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and collyn one thing i would say is the providers are assuming that the market reopens right this we did this we had great closings in a very difficult environment where we had to get attorneys together appraisers together we get actual appraisals were not we are in the marketplace closing loans on a daily basis with all these operational issues that are out there assuming that the country reopens that only would be better for us collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but your assumption that you close that pipeline lets assume things dont open certainly not new york city indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc assuming assuming the lawyers are in business and assuming that the banks are still funding well be funding we went through a pretty collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc difficult march and april right so and we had some very significant originations we had substantial originations collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then just on the amount that you deferred you gave the ltvs on those loans you gave what the debt service coverage is on that on thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah yeah sure the debt service cover is at for the top for the thats the commercial real estate portfolio and for the multi collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and thats for the deferred loans or thats for the broader book thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats only for the deferred loans thats right new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then of thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc of those deferreds how much of those were going to be coming due contractually anyway this year thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i dont have that number for you i would again i would guess probably not many but i can follow up on you offline on that collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i think whats interesting about the program we were very active and obviously it was publicized within one day that were doing this so people when you read the real deal its public that were doing this program and people call and we offered it and more importantly weve done our own due diligence on each customer right and the fact that you have to have your escrows current you have to be current on the payment and we worked out a six month arrangement we think that liquidity indiscernible for them for the next six months will be very helpful to get to the other side of this problem we have with this pandemic in the united states and we think that sixmonth time should be reasonable we could have gone a shorter period we think six months is more reasonable because its going to take a few months here to get us in particular on the ground floor for businesses but we think its a reasonable timeframe that we can at least have the landlords work it out with their tenants so we can move forward and be there and be supportive of them given the crisis collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 okay along those lines and you sort of answered it but just broadly right so obviously sitting in unprecedented times your book has not been tested to this degree i dont think i wouldnt even say tested it like it does right now how does that impact the way youre thinking about the reserves i mean it was a modest reserve build this quarter just kind of broadly given the risks that are out there how are you thinking about indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so collyn im going to actually defer the time tested to joe ficalora who has been with the bank well over years joe maybe you want to talk about the time tested as far as your experience in multiple decades more than i have joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well i think the good news we are structured such that this adverse change which of course was not anticipated is not all that different than many other reasons why a market place deteriorates and payments are deferred or otherwise evaporate the environment were in presents challenge but none of this challenge actually changes the reasonable expectations that our owners will in fact remain stable our buildings will remain stable and much much more importantly we cultivate relationships that are way bigger than isolated properties that are funded by us the very people that have each and every loan with us in many cases are extremely large players in the new york market and they have long history with us and the opportunity that a deteriorating market represents and in every deteriorating market the large players buy and in every circumstance when theyre buying in a deteriorating market we fund there is a very big difference between having a relationship with us and having a relationship with a giant bank or with another bank many other banks literally vacate the space because theyre experiencing so much adverse performance theyre not willing to continue to lend within the space were not having adverse performance and we gained share during periods of crisis the period ahead will literally provide for us additional market share and that additional market share will give us the ability to grow our book with good product and better than existing rates the ability for us to earn on our principal asset go forward is actually better than it has been for a long period of time thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc look collyn ill address the reserve indiscernible good history of the bank and obviously hes been here for many decades as far as the reserve is concerned assuming the covid did not happen weve guided in the first quarter for cecl that indiscernible be no impact at all other than the transitional adjustment that we took so just that if you take covid out of the equation for the first quarter youre looking at probably close to a zero provision in in first quarter so thats kind of how we looked at the covid analysis in particular we actually did some more quantitative adjustments just because of the moodys change on as far as their view of unemployment going into in the second and third quarter so were indiscernible history of really no losses in the marketplace and these are predominantly residential units that are housing people in the city of new york so we feel highly confident that our loss content is low but yeah obviously we booked a sizable adjustment that we didnt anticipate because of covid19 collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 okay all right and just lastly i wanted to clarify there was some confusion at least to me the way the press release was written and i know the share count moves happens in the first quarter what was how many what did you guys buy back this quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc its in the press release i mean we were slightly active and we had a little bit indiscernible evaluate the market depending on market conditions but its really not a material number left as of yeah very small indiscernible so we did buy shares collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah okay thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible given the price action in the quarter sure collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay the actual share number is in the press release that you bought back this quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible we have the numbers on the second page john yeah its in there second page collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and you did not issue any shares then in the quarter indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc oh just normal indiscernible its netted against the plan when you look at the share count in the back of the documentation its netted against indiscernible  so i would say probably what weve bought back is what weve issued for mlp shares no significant change there we dont have we dont have a material buyback in place its insignificant collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay i will leave it there thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc it doesnt mean that were not buying back shares right so were not halting anything we feel very bullish about our business and obviously very and we pay a very strong dividend were comfortable that given the guidance i gave you albeit credit issues which we know unforeseen credit issues were looking at significant eps growth new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 and more importantly doubledigit margin growth every quarter throughout and actually youll see growth continue to but i dont want to get too ahead of myself but clearly this has been a significant change of our funding costs going forward so youll see q1 up basis points q1 versus up i mean sorry q2 versus up indiscernible q1 thats a substantial change we envision that change continuing in q3 and q4 as well collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay very good ill leave it there thank you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc good morning guys so just back on the cre book real quick what was the total retail exposure you had how large is that segment roughly and can you just talk about like a rough breakdown of that what that is whether its mixed use strip centers whatnot thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so again we have approximately billion of retail storesshopping center of which weve indicated about million of that as deferred that ltv in that portfolio is like with a debt service coverage ratio as far as further breakdown we do have office and professional buildings in the cre book which is a vast majority of it thats about billion of which million is deferred which is and that ltv i believe is about a with a debt service coverage ratio so a lot of it mostly in the manhattan region david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah and pretty low ltvs too thats good thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc oh yeah oh yeah i mean we have a handful of garages theres no people going to parking garages so thats going to be deferred and its not material for us but we would expect that to go for a deferral program until they start opening up the city again new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah and then you guys gave us some great color on the cash flow trends for the rentregulated multifamily piece and i know youre holding most of that at a risk weight given the loans meet certain debt service coverage and ltv requirements was just wondering what those thresholds are for debt service coverage and ltv that they have to continue to meet in order to maintain that capital treatment and then do you have thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah and then do the loans have to switch to risk weight if you trigger one of those thresholds or do they have to trigger both how does that work thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so its is the number and then ltv and weve been in constant dialogue with obviously our regulators but the reality is this regulatory expectation under the cares act is to work with the customers were getting some very good latitude now based on this change under the versus we envision that after these customers come off a deferral theyll be treated as if they were riskweighted thats what were expecting could that change possibly we dont expect that to change we believe that the cares act was very clear for the banking sector to work with your customers so i believe that well have some grandfathering in when we make these deferrals and when they come back we hope that theyll be cash flowing north of that and the ltvs will be wellinsulated so we should have we dont know if thats going to be the final ruling when the regulators decide a year from now but clearly theres a lot of regulatory guidance and weve been working directly with the regulators as far as some specific guidance given our business model and it appears that under the cares act theres theres a mission here for the banking sector to step up and do right by the customer base given our ltvs given our business model we feel highly confident that these when we get to the other side people will be living in manhattan and the five boroughs and paying their rents david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc if you have to and if you have to restructure any of those and the restructured loan actually meets all the criteria is it okay or its because youve restructured it it actually has to go to risk weighted thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i think that will be fine on the reconstruction but again i dont want to get the cart before the horse here again we feel highly confident that as we get to the other side people are going to be living and working in the city and we believe that theres still a housing shortage in manhattan theres still a rent regulation shortage in manhattan so we think theyll be fully occupied and were not in a luxury market were nonluxury lenders right so even though our buildings have a blend of rent regulated indiscernible is nonluxury for the most part new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 so we have a unique portfolio in the event the market was to be priced itself down as far as rentals were insulated because were not looking at the luxury market so we feel pretty confident but we dont have a crystal ball this is a like as collyn said untested times but were working with our customers and given the percentage that has occurred the good news in the past week or so we havent seen any upticks of more people asking for deferral so were almost sitting here in may we think a lot of thats been out already so well monitor every month and the next time we speak to you in next quarter well have an update but the good news is that here we are coming into may and we dont see the spike in additional requests david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay and then how often do you have to do that cash is that once a quarter or once a year and when does that typically happen thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc we do it every quarter depending on what loan comes due as far as the review sure quarterly indiscernible by the way its all automated quarterly david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cool okay and maybe just one last one on expenses how are you thinking about that trend at this point is that you were talking about maybe for the year in the last call is that still a level you think you can achieve thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah it seems that look i think q1 was better than expected i think q2 will probably be better than expected internally so anywhere from to 129ish just slightly south of and then maybe flat for the rest of the year again were not seeing a ramp up in expenses now we dont anticipate substantial expense because of covid but well evaluate as we move along here but i would say based on absent the pandemic versus last year i think our expense guide is still within that range i dont see any major change here i would say the only real change is that we havent completed our conversion and that would have probably added some savings but i guess it gets postponed because of the stayathome order we anticipate to have that once the once new york opens up hopefully by the summer well be able to do the full conversion david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay all right thanks guys thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning pete peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning pete peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc the ones that reach contractual maturity and then get refinanced can we just talk about whats happening to the ltvs with those loans and also whats happening with the cap rates post the new rent regulation laws thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so we indiscernible our cap rates post id say prepandemic and we actually saw a slight drop in cap rates believe it or not we didnt change the way we viewed our stress testing because of that we do it every six months we evaluate the market so from june to cap rates actually trickled down a little bit believe it or not so in our internal analysis when we look at stress testing and how we look at the potential risk we simply kept it flat without decreasing it i would say that its too early to tell how thats going to pan out in this environment but interest rates again near zero we have a higher spread but youre still talking about a mid3 type coupon so we havent seen any noticeable changes yet who knows what happens in the next two three quarters out but clearly no noticeable change in cap rates and with that being said when we when we have loans that come due to us we havent seen any situations where customers can cash flow out on a refinance if anything customers are still actively taking down funding because theyve improved their rent roll theyve been working so these are i would say delayed refinancing indiscernible have an average life thats this short youd assume that the portfolio is so short because the people have delayed their refinancing so they still have equity built and they are still drawing down equity and like i said given this environment given the nature of the difficulties in the environment were actually tightening our standards on refi cashout where were actually withholding escrowable taxes and pi payments for a period of six months as part of our strategy to mitigate risk peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and then can i just ask about how big the ppp program is and with this downturn is there an opportunity to take market share from the larger banks aside from the multifamily business thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 yeah so pete for us you know were not a ci lender so were a commercial real estate lender and mostly multifamily so weve got geared up we were a little bit late on getting geared up we worked with thirdparty providers we partnered with a thirdparty provider and we were very active on the second round so our ppp numbers are going to be between million to million at best however a lot of the customers that we have internally were putting through this system and were getting great success our team has done a phenomenal job in getting it up and running but its interesting this is more anecdotal a lot of our indiscernible customers come from other banks bank of america jpmorgan citibank in particular where they had no results these are smaller businesses that were left behind on the first round we put them through the second round and they were successful and believe or not they are switching their accounts to nycb you still have to go through the vetting process you still have to go through the bsa process theres a lot of work but many small businesses were left behind locally so were there for them were actively taking some new business but i wont see its going to be material but i think on an anecdotal basis theres no question that the larger players are protecting their book and we were there to pick up a handful of crumbs here and there to help out the local community as joe said this morning its a family here these are local businesses that need help and were going to here help the local community not a big number for us but we are in the program peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks guys thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please proceed christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thank you for all your information this morning if we go back to the beginning of the call when joe mentioned the sort of implied survey of collected in april would that number get stronger in may and june do you think and does that ultimately kind of square with the deferrals that youve talked about this morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc joe you want to handle that one new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah i think that that number does continue to strengthen were in a very very good place with the relevant players in our niche so our ability to not only have a performing portfolio but a growing portfolio in the period ahead is quite real and is very consistent with how we performed in other stressed environments we should assume the period ahead to be stressed and during that period we will gain share of what we want from the marketplace and therefore as has always been the case during periods of difficulty we do not just better than our peers but better than we historically have done and this environment presents opportunity for us to lend favorably in greater numbers in the environment in front of us thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great joe thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc chris i would just add to joes commentary big picture our portfolio were a very large player in this marketplace so we have 100plus families in some of these large buildings and clusters of buildings and we you think about the percentage of deferral versus all the other deferrals its the lowest percentage that means were getting significant rent collections these are very sophisticated billionaire property owners that have devalued equity that are going to protect their investment but more importantly theyre not even asking for deferral so if the program is out there only has come to the table on the 100plus family dwellings which is very encouraging now the smaller ones obviously its a higher percentage because you have that ground floor issue and you can have revenue coming in so going to the next months ahead as the country opens up and the city opens up and they start working out their lease arrangements with their tenants we envision that in the next sixmonth period to start to stabilize christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thats helpful and just a followup tom my impression has been that you still are sitting on enormous liquidity to deploy and that that liquidity really presents new opportunities for you both on the investment side as well as loans as youve documented so will that kind of get put to work in the next two quarters or do you think its going to take in the next year to really deploy kind of your full horsepower thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so chris we do have a lot of liquidity on the balance sheet we have excess cash we sold some securities going into the second quarter actually end of the middle of the first quarter given that we felt that rates were going to go much lower than they were these are floating rate securities that would have been having close to yield that was about million that created a lot of cash for us we believe thatll be put right back into our new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 core lending product so we want to stay liquid we want to have the liquidity and the cash to fund on that loan book i dont think theres a lot of value in the securities market right now there was maybe a one or twoweek blip during the end of the quarter as the market dislocated but it seems that given where the treasury is very active on buying all asset classes we will probably be keeping securities portfolio relatively flat because indiscernible any riskreward opportunity there and put it into our loan portfolio which as joe said joe indicated if this continues and were in a difficult cycle we tend to have significant growth were only forecasting but you can easily see a substantial number of growth because of the retention that we have within our own portfolio and the lack of market players who want to step into this market christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great tom thank you again appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from matthew breese with stephens please proceed matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc morning matt morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc looking at the borrowings book ive been surprised that the costs there havent come in more can you give us the breakdown between the structural advances and the classic advances and help me better understand how the structured advance side behaves and reprices relative to changes in the yield curve thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so we have what about billion john thats john j pinto a executive vice president chief accounting officer new york community bancorp inc yeah billion in puttable thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah billion of puttable its interesting because obviously in january the environment was different than the end of march right so we had some money coming due in the beginning of the quarter we refinanced that at new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 lower cost based on what was coming off however where we are today that number is close to zero if you hedge it if you put a derivative against and if you just go straightforward you still had a number thats probably what basis points basis points basis points for twoyear bullet so i think the cost is coming down materially we wouldve been active when we look at the opportunity to get unique swap opportunities that probably drives maybe anywhere from to depending on the anomaly of the marketplace and theres been a lot of anomalies so you could effectively borrow money swap it out from float to fixed fixed to float and then youre looking at a effective interest rate which is unique but the reality is that its significantly lower than our current cost of thats coming due which is around in the remainder of we have about billion coming through this quarter another million to million in q3 another million at the end of the year and indiscernible is q2 and then the back half for the year is so for the six months ended so again matthew breese q analyst stephens inc im sorry are you putting that are you more apt to put on the structured with a swap at bps or are you going to take the classic at thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc we may just keep it short in this ball basis points indiscernible i mean we have opportunities we dont see the fed actively driving interest rates higher here so we have options right but the options are still all well below so conservatively in our model we have high cost i gave you doubledigit margin expansion with expensive funding so im assuming our funding will be cheaper so im hoping my guide and my margins even conservative up double digit matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and is that the risk to that portfolio that interest rates go higher and the fed has the federal home loan has the right to call it thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible rates go up basis points theyre going to call it but again if you think rates are going up basis points thats not what were running in our model we have the fed remaining flat this year im not going to talk about im talking about and i dont envision any real changes to policy given the current situation with that being said in the event a puttable structure gets called and rates are obvious to have higher borrowing costs thats correct matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay understood and then whats the incremental securities yields that book i mean on a quarteroverquarter basis fell quite a bit just curious what the incremental what does it look like if you do buy what are you buying and whats the yield on it thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 yeah so like i said were not buying anything were just keeping it flat so if we still get called out we have some calls expected so lets just say we may have a few basis points bleed next quarter if not could be flat this quarter depending on what prepays and speeds we do have some mortgagerelated securities its all agency for the most part so were not really in the market buying so i would say that unless we see a significant dislocation in security yields and is attractive opportunity well keep it flat matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then i appreciate the retail exposure in the commercial real estate book just curious is there any additional retail exposure in the specialty finance book and whats the health and characteristics of those borrowers if theres any thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i would say i mean we have a handful of maybe some grocers some household and grocers that have been very successful because their business is booming right now so theyve been drawing down on their facility but id say for the most part especially finance group has been performing a stellar performance we havent had a delinquency since weve been in the business and as far as our ratings were very comfortable with all the credits we have were very selective we always talked about that that what we see or of that we decline so we have large relationships amazon some indiscernible some very big large household names were not the lead bank we participate on where we feel theres low risk and again this is not a high yielding portfolio but its a low risk portfolio and its super senior secured i would say on a deferral perspective youre probably looking at maybe million of deferrals on auto but we think that the auto sector will be fine this year and by the end of the year that stuff will go off of deferral and well be back in business and by the way all these clients in the auto have access to ppp and theyve all been funded so we feel pretty good about that matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay last one is just on capital how comfortable are you operating at these levels especially as new york city is the epicenter and economic conditions do remain uncertain thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so again i would say very comfortable obviously were going to earn more money this year assuming that credit holds itself weve taken a sizable provision for covid19 absent covid19 we talked about cecl we didnt expect to have any real provision in the quarter other than the transitional adjustment so we think that our portfolios performed very well in this environment we are not a ci lender we do have tenants that landlords that have tenants that have retail and they have to work that out but given the deferrals program we think that as they open up the city as they open up america we should be in a good place matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it great thats all i had appreciate taking my questions new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible operator and our final question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc morning just in terms of the margin i guess im a little surprised that you dont get more benefit sort of near term and it sounds like you get as you said doubledigit nim expansion sort of every quarter over the course of the year can you just talk about like why its i may so consistent over the course of the year is it just because of how your deposits are repricing thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so rates are zero close to zero so pretty much the entire liability side of the balance is getting close to zero so thats the major driver at the same time we do have lots of loans coming due and were not getting bleed on the loan yields going forward and the coupons are reasonable theyre not spiking but if we take the cost of funds close to zero pretty much all of our most of our retail funding is tied to shortterm funds right so like i said billion plus this quarter is at and theres really no high cost opportunity in the marketplace we dont envision customers leaving the bank to go somewhere else so and if thats being said we still have the ability to borrow funds that are close to zero so i think that the funding cost is clearly driving this opportunity and at the same time asset yields are holding up very nicely so youre going to have like i said doubledigit margin growth in the second quarter we envision that happening in q3 and q4 as well we talked about q1 being up basis points we hit our guidance the pandemic hit towards the middle of march and the fed thought of cutting interest rates we actively cut interest rates and then were going to see that benefit going right into the q2 again we dont know where the markets going to end up on shortterm funds but given that the where the countrys position is my guess is that rates are going to stay relatively low in and most customers are not going to go past one year to restructure their cd portfolio and as we continue to build the savings account and not operate on operating accounts that will also benefit a very stable cost of funds for the bank ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it but in terms of the timing thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible go back just remember we had five years of not seeing nii growth we were positioned at the lowest returns this bank has experienced so were in an upward trajectory both the eps growth and margin expansion this will continue into we do not have the crystal ball whats going to happen new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2020 and were talking about margin expansion here but we think the margin bottomed out in the fourth quarter of we saw that inflection point is going to continue significantly because of fed action at the same time the business model is getting a much higher spread that were accustomed to when the competition is robust fannie freddie cmbs the whole world looking to get into the space youre at to spread right so when we raised that to after the rent was changed now were north of so thats a very healthy spread ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and back in terms of the timing though i mean do you have just as much repricing in second quarter down couple hundred basis points as you do in say fourth quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes second quarter on the cd side just under billion and thats a so its continuing so youre going to get the benefit from the repricing in q2 going to q3 and more benefit in q3 as well that continues throughout the whole year so again i feel highly confident that were going to have a very nice nii growth okay top line growth eps growth assuming and im not talking about the potential of credit because thats the unknown out there and i understand that but clearly if you run that analysis given where our profitability was which was sub1 on return on average tangible assets youll see a very unique growth in earnings story and growth in margin story that could continue throughout and were only talking to right now its shortterm visibility but for the shortterm in the second quarter margin expansion double digits ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc and is that margin expansion also premised on the view that your credit spreads stay above basis points thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah but yeah but again we have a coupon coming on indiscernible pipeline were feeding our pipeline through our model right the model is sophisticated we just take the billion pipe that we have we have new money and thats going on at now new moneys has gotten that new deals that we would offer you if you come to the bank tomorrow indiscernible credit if youre a little less than a youre going to pay closer to ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay great thank you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc ken pleasure operator we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing
