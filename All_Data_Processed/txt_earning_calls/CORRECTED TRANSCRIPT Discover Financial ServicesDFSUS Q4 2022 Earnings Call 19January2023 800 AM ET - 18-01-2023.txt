net income of billion or per share for the fourth quarter and billion or per share for the full year this was accomplished against a fluid and unusual macroeconomic and monetary policy backdrop and i want to thank the entire discover team for their solid execution this performance gives us significant momentum going into and beyond i want to give a few highlights that underscore these strong results first we grew new accounts by and loan receivables by this demonstrates the appeal of our consumer value proposition and advancements in our consumer targeting and acquisition capabilities while maintaining our conservative approach to underwriting and credit management discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 were also prudently investing for growth including in acquisition and brand marketing the continuing buildout of our data and analytic capabilities and increasing field personnel for both servicing and collections all while achieving a efficiency ratio the combination of revenue expansion and disciplined cost management contributed to our return on equity this past year and underscores the highly capitalgenerative nature of our business model over the course of we repurchased billion in common stock and increased our dividend by over and we expect to sustain attractive levels of capital return to our shareholders into the future as we look into we expect a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop nevertheless we intend to maintain an appropriate level of investment in our organization for example we have several initiatives that will improve our digital marketing capabilities and we anticipate the broad market launch of our massmarket cashback debit product and of course well continue to invest in our brand and in account acquisition in a manner consistent with the environment were very aware of the climate in which we are operating and should there be changes in economic conditions we will adjust our model with its focus on prime lending and throughthecycle underwriting has historically supported resilient returns through the economic cycle these factors combined with our earnings power reserves and capital underpin our strategy of being the leading consumer digital bank ill now turn the call over to john to review our results in audio gap john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone ill start with our financial summary results on slide the takeaway of the quarter is largely about strong asset growth and net interest margin expansion partially offset by growthbased provisioning asset growth combined with a nim rate improvement increased revenue sequentially and yearover year similar to last quarter asset growth also drove an increase in our reserves of million this increase kept our reserve coverage ratio relatively flat at in the prior year we released million of reserves so while our reported net income was down yearover year adjusting for the reserve change our net income would have been higher on a yearoveryear basis lets review the details starting on slide net interest income was up million yearoveryear or our net interest margin expanded benefiting from the higher prime rate partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances nim ended the quarter at up basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially for the full year nim was up basis points from the prior year receivable growth was driven by card which increased yearoveryear reflecting continued strong sales new account growth and payment rate moderation sales increased in the period a deceleration from the growth we experienced in the prior quarter and in the first half of the year new card accounts grew by from last years fourth quarter similar to the prior quarter the sales growth decline was mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate which fell basis points in the quarter we expect payment rates to continue to decline through but at a more moderate pace discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 turning to our noncard products organic student loans increased as a result of peak season originations personal loans were up we continue to stay disciplined in our approach to marketing underwriting and pricing of this product our attractive value proposition has positioned us well in the market that is experiencing strong consumer demand and some improvement in competitive conditions in terms of funding mix our customer deposit balances were up yearoveryear and sequentially deposit pricing continues to be in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment recently we have seen some moderation in the pace of pricing changes looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was partially due to a million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a million loss this quarter adjusting for these our noninterest income was up this increase was primarily driven by two items first loan fee income was up million or driven by volume and second we had higher net discount and interchange revenue which was up million or reflecting strong sales and a favorable sales mix partially offset by higher rewards costs moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear and up from the prior quarter compensation costs were up primarily due to increased head count and wage inflation marketing expenses increased million or as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products premise and equipment expense was elevated this quarter due to a onetime write off related to the exit of our phoenix servicing location adjusting for this premise and equipment would have been flat to the prior year quarter with this recent action we have resized or exited three of our four major call center locations and will continue to evaluate our footprint going forward moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter in the card portfolio the net chargeoff rate of was basis points higher than the prior year and basis points higher sequentially as expected portfolio loss rates are normalizing reflecting seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years normalization of older vintages and mild deterioration in low credit bands largely inflationdriven these trends are within our expected risk tolerances and are consistent with our historical approach to underwriting and credit management among our core prime revolver segment we dont see evidence of broader stress given the robust labor market ill cover our view in a moment turning to the discussions of our allowance on slide this quarter we increased our allowance by million driven by the increase in receivable balances our reserve rate declined slightly to adjusting for the elevated level of transactor balances in the fourth quarter our reserve rate would have been near sequentially flat under the cecl accounting standard we are required to contemplate life of loan losses and adjust our reserve levels accordingly for us the changes to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to our forecast for the yearend reserve our baseline assumption was unemployment in between and with alternative scenarios above discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was our longerterm target remains at we expect to make progress against this target over the next four to six quarters yesterday we announced a quarterly common dividend of per share and in the fourth quarter of we repurchased million of common stock concluding on slide with our outlook momentum is strong which should help to generate doubledigit revenue growth and positive operating leverage we expect endofperiod loan growth to be in the low doubledigits with average loan growth somewhat higher this is driven by three factors our prior year growth in new accounts moderation in the payment rate and sales volume trends through midjanuary sales are up but we expect deceleration to the high singledigits over the course of the year we expect net interest margin to be modestly higher than the fullyear levels more specifically we expect nim to be above the fourth quarter levels in the first half of the year driven by continued loan repricing benefits and decline in the second half we are looking for total operating expenses to increase less than salary and benefit expense will increase due to hiring in the second half of additionally we expect marketing to be above our fullyear level we expect net chargeoffs will average between and for the full year the low end of the range is more in line with our base case while the high end is more consistent with a weaker employment scenario lastly we have billion of remaining capacity under the billion share repurchase program that expires in june of this year we expect to repurchase around billion of shares in the first half of well provide an update on future share repurchase authorizations after we complete our stress testing process and review recommendations with our board in summary receivable growth continued to benefit from new account acquisition payment rate moderation and positive sales nim continues to benefit from prime rate increases with funding costs consistent with expectations and credit is performing in line with our approach to throughthecycle underwriting process and conservative credit management our perspectives for reflects our focus on advancing our strategic priorities generating high returns and capital while remaining disciplined in our credit and expense management with that ill turn the call back over to our operator to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and john thanks for kind of outlining the parameters of the range of expected credit loss but could you talk a little bit about the past kind of from here to getting to the like what either has to happen thats bad or not happen thats good and at what points along that way would you know whether that base case is too high or too low john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah great yeah thanks for the question moshe so the range is ph somewhat locked right to for and we certainly have a great deal of visibility through the first six months of the year through a roll rate methodology post six months so in the second half of the year we use our analytical models which anticipate a number of different possible outcomes but used as historical data thats been tested significantly to make a projection of what we expect to happen so as we get through the first quarter well be able to see whats happening with our roll rates in terms of is it a roll to one bucket and a roll to two bucket consistent with our expectations on the base case on the reserve beyond that well certainly look at the macro environment and whats happening with unemployment levels and the overall job market that will give us some perspective and then an important component of this and i know there were some questions in terms of the stepup from where we ended to where were projecting we have fairly significant vintages that are going through the normal seasoning process right now so for example our endofperiod card portfolio so last year to this year increased by billion and if you think about kind of a maturity cycle of a credit card typically within the first year to two years you hit peak losses so that is some of what were expecting here and therefore the guidance that weve provided we do expect that in a stable macroeconomic environment in the second half of the year we should see this slope of the curve begin to bend down a little bit with perhaps top losses coming through in and then returning down so overall what were seeing here is just a strong portfolio very significant vintages that came through in and that are seasoning at levels that are completely within our expectation of total return thresholds and then well see the overall portfolio normalize so hopefully that provides some clarity on both the trajectory as well as what were seeing in the portfolio moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc perfect thanks john and just as a follow up the reserve rate was down you mentioned that was largely a result of transactor balances but i guess even with that it wasnt up and so when you think about that kind of how do you i mean how should we think it doesnt feel like youre anticipating a deteriorating environment if youre keeping your reserve certainly no worse than flat and how do we think about that going through as well thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes great question and theyre connected so happy to cover them in the same set so cecl reflects life of loan losses as we all know right and so what drives that is the portfolio performance and our view of the macroeconomic environment today and going forward and we havent had any substantial changes to the macroeconomic environment and essentially the portfolio is performing within our expected ranges of outcomes so as we looked at the fourth quarter receivable balances in the aggregate and the portfolio performance a stable macro we felt most appropriate reserve levels would be fairly consistent with what we did in the third quarter and essentially without taking you through a ton of detail that teams spend weeks and weeks working through thats essentially how we arrived at the answer operator thank you our next question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning maybe just a followup question to the credit questions moshe asked john you talked about the seasoning is there any way to parse apart the impact of seasoning in your range versus the actual degradation as a result of just the deteriorating delinquencies on a base case and then you mentioned sort of the slope of the curve decelerates i think you said in the second half but just want to make sure to understand sort of how the seasoning will impact us for the next two years does it still weigh in on you in the first half of john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so in terms of the impact of the vintages i explicitly called out the card vintage in so the billion to give the folks that are listening here a place to anchor on in terms of thinking about the vintage and then you can run out peak losses for our portfolio in terms of what typically happens after a significant vintage and in a stable macro so that should help you at least in terms of the thinking in terms of the vintage as we think about this year we gave that range of to on the average loan base so you should think about the ultimate kind of range here it will depend first on the macro second well continue to give updates in each of the quarters in terms of what were seeing but ultimately we expect this vintage will mature in and then we should see in a stable macro the curve not only the slope bending but actually inverting slightly sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay followup question on loan growth obviously you mentioned the strong growth driving the seasoning but you guys are still expecting doubledigit growth in the face of maybe a tougher economic backdrop what gives you the comfort here maybe roger speaking to the growth in the past and i know every cycle takes on a different complexion what are you guys looking at that makes you comfortable to grow here because thats a question i get quite a bit from investors roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 yes good question sanjay i think youve seen us operate this business through multiple cycles and the disciplined approach we take both in good times as well as in bad and frequently the accounts that you put on during a challenging economic time perform extraordinarily well and you can see very good cost per account as competitors pull back so we have been pretty clear that starting in the back half of last year we started tightening credit standards and you can expect us to continue to look at that and adjust according to economic conditions both for new accounts as well as the portfolio nevertheless were seeing great returns on the marketing investments were putting out there and so thats what gives us the confidence to keep investing in growth sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks for taking my questions and not to beat the dead horse but maybe just one more question on the kind of the provisioning and the credit john i think you kind of detailed the unemployment assumptions i think they were kind of in the to range with maybe ph similar making the range kind of the middle of the fairway just maybe can you tell us whats the sensitivity for either the chargeoffs or the all sic alll if say unemployment moves to level like basis points higher than that john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so in our kind of primary case here we assumed a basis points increase in unemployment now that was specific to our chargeoff forecast in terms of kind of reserve levels we actually used a composite of multiple scenarios the more heavily weighted scenario reflected a loss rate of and then going up all the way to so im feeling actually like were down the middle here in terms of appropriateness in terms of overall reserve levels and more specificity in terms of sensitivity i dont think that would be a service given if were seeing unemployment kind of creep up in that sort of manner or that sort of quantum that would indicate that the macro environment has changed and we have to change our view on that which could change our perspectives on life of loan losses john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats helpful and then you gave annual guidance with nim and it sounds like maybe an elevated nim in the first part of the year coming down second what are the drivers of that with respect to the yield and the cost of capital john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes yes so im going to run through the primary drivers so first would be the fed rate changes in the second half of as well as what weve anticipated either two or three increases in second impact is the yield on our investments which is improving with the increase in the rate environment and then the third piece has been some pricing actions we took in the consumer banking products so think about the noncard products discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 so offsetting that would be kind of the cost of funding so dtc and external funding costs have increased and then were also anticipating an impact from credit all of which the net of those gives us a high level of confidence that certainly were going to see peak nim in the first quarter and then stepping down from there through john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc thanks i have one more credit question for you i know you dont generally give out guidance more than one year out but i think some of the commentary around the chargeoff guidance has some implications for i just wanted to try and clarify i mean if you look at the guidance range it seems to imply you kind of exit at a chargeoff rate at to i think john you indicated as kind of a peak year should we expect is it reasonable to assume that thats implying kind of a chargeoff rate north of for john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so you were right on your call here we gave a range for of to i talked about the curve and what we think will happen to the curve and the slope of that so mark as a matter of prudence i think thats probably as far as im going to go here mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay fair enough thanks for that color operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning maybe a slightly different way to address this question is you perhaps could give us some color on where you have seen your fully seasoned vintages peak in terms of net chargeoff rates and around what kind of months within the seasoning path that happens you know range of months that would be helpful to understand john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so typically well see it around months and it varies based on credit quality so the highest credit quality so think fico would typically peak a little later and then the weaker ill say the weaker credits typically peak a little bit earlier but on average think about months or so discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the level that youve been seeing it would be helpful to understand how historically the vintages that you underwrite to are trajecting in terms of peak and maybe if you could comp vintage and what youre seeing there would be helpful thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so the first part of that answer would be it would depend on the vintage so if you go back to our vintage and remember theres covid right we were locked down we ceased underwriting kind of the near prime and lower prime and concentrated on upper prime that vintage will season at a peak loss level below what discover historically has done if you look at we were essentially back to a underwriting standard consistent with history and you can use that information to get some level of comfort around what can be expected in on this vintage betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay because youre basically saying is a normal is exhibiting behavior that is more normal precovid type of vintages john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services it is yes yes the one difference that i think is important for folks to codify in their minds is that were coming off an abnormally low base right so the entire portfolio is normalizing weve talked about that consistently actually since the beginning of last year that we thought the portfolio was normalizing and what youre seeing here in the guidance is essentially the portfolio normalizing betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but the current reserve ratio level is consistent with this normalization whereby peak losses hit in john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes otherwise my controller would have taken exception to our reserve process betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and this is i know were talking about card but is this the same kind of expectation across the other asset classes as well student personal john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes although what were seeing in personal loans is again loss rates below historical norms payment rate is beginning to normalize and we had talked about the fact that we perhaps overcorrected on that product in terms of underwriting in terms of the pullback we pulled back significantly discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 so i expect some seasoning and normalization there but again were very very confident about the loss performance of that product we understand where it is on the payment priorities for folks so were going to be mindful of the economy on that and student loans yeah thats normalizing we did have and likely will have a little bit of impact when we see the full impact of these student debtors on the government programs having to pay back loans but its underwritten to a high standard 80plus percent have cosigners so we feel very comfortable about that product as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from rick shane of jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions look this is an interesting milestone where the reserve rate is basis points it basically is applestoapples seasonality versus cecl day one and up basis points im curious when we think about your economic outlook and how you build a cecl reserve where you compare to cecl day one on a likeforlike basis would you build the same allowance or have you made adjustments and then compare your economic outlooks in each of those points in time please john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so good question rick so weve referenced cecl day one in the past but id like to remind folks day one was first time we rolled this new standard out we were using new models theyve been tested extensively and the macros were latecycle with higher unemployment levels so as we look at kind of where we are today or as of the fourth quarter right in terms of total loss reserve rate that seems appropriate based on kind of what were seeing in the macros and how the portfolio is performing so do we specifically reference day only from the standpoint of where it was back on january to where it is today but we dont use that as a decision point whatsoever richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc john understood im more curious that if you like were youve described that the models have evolved and i think that thats fair and i think everybody appreciates that what im asking is on a likeforlike basis do you think that reserve rates are lower today using the same assumptions as you refine them versus cecl day one john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah no no theyre not lower were looking at the portfolio performance its performed extraordinarily well were seeing a bit of seasoning now as you would expect in this type of product and the macros are contemplating a minimum level of increase in unemployment of at least and more likely so what youre seeing here is a cecl reserve for the quarter that reflects those macros discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you and good morning maybe some commentary roger on the competitive environment for rewards i mean youve seen very strong growth out of a number of players in the industry including yourselves are you seeing more competition where are you seeing more competition more people getting more aggressive if you would roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thanks bob it remains i would say intensely competitive but as youve seen from the growth especially the performance in new accounts our value proposition is competing well and again i want to give credit to some of the advancements on the analytics that let us sort of personalize the marketing messages across different channels i guess where competition has lightened a bit is in the personal loan space i think there are a lot of nonbankfunded folks there who may have some challenges on the other side of the balance sheet and obviously one big player who had been active is pulling out on the deposit side i would see there i think youre starting to see the gap between the direct banks and the branch banks really get wide enough that youre seeing flows to the direct system right its now at for savings rate its now a lot more worth your money so again really excited about how our products are competing across every segment and so thats part of why were optimistic going into robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc what new products i mean your cashback debit is something that youve talked about what new products are you most excited about roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services youre highlighting probably the big launch for next year which will be the relaunch of cashback debit and we hope to be doing some massmarket advertising of that beyond that i really believe we have the right product set were seeing great demand for example on the home equity side given how rates have moved and the lack of cashout refi so i think part of how we keep our costs as low as they are is a very simple lean operating model so i wouldnt expect anything other than the relaunch of the cashback debit and well put a lot of weight behind that robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 operator thank you our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc back to the credit topic anything about the chargeoff guidance thats baked into your guidance that is a surprise at all in terms of what youre observing i know you talked about the seasoning and the vintages and it sounds like theres nothing there that really surprised you but im wondering anything about the credit migration within the vintages within the portfolio and the past dues or customer behavior that surprised you that led to the increase in the chargeoff guidance that seems to be well above where the street was expecting thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks john actually no surprises in the portfolio performance whatsoever and i want to reiterate that and thats essentially why the reserve rate is flat right so they are connected so what that says is that charge off guidance was essentially contemplated in the reserving of life of loan losses so we feel very good about that and there is consistency i did talk about in my prepared remarks that the lowest end of the credit spectrum that we have in our portfolio so some nearprime and some folks without fico scores or those who fell below are certainly feeling the impact from inflation but internally we completely anticipated that we had run some analysis on inflation shocks and what it would do to some of the card members and its performing essentially where we thought it would come out so im actually quite pleased about that the other important thing that i want to make sure that the audience hear is i think what did for us is it increased the earnings power of the firm and theres a lot of focus from these questions on kind of the chargeoff and peak chargeoffs but weve put on good assets consistent with what weve done historically so loans increased billion so theres going to be some seasoning but overall the earnings power of the firm has increased as a result of great execution by our teams john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thats helpful and then again just i know this gets to cecl and the whole spirit of it but given your commentary and that you just indicated reserve flat so if the macro outlook progresses within your scenarios and the loss migration progresses as you described here into of this vintage and no other surprises elsewhere then would you expect accordingly that the reserve at would generally remain around that level in discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 that case or could there be incremental upside to the reserve assuming that macro backdrop remains as theyre within the scenario bands john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so i appreciate the question a lot of assumptions in there but as you laid out i would expect the overall reserve rates to be relatively close to kind of where they are today john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning roger and john thanks for taking my question first i wanted to ask if you could give us a sense of what kind of delinquency rates youd expect based on that to nco rate outlook john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes i mean we dont typically forecast the delinquency rates what i suggest you do is take a look at the trust data and the relative difference between the trust data historically and where the total company is coming out that will give some insights and then also the trends in delinquencies typically are pretty consistent right you can go point to point to point and then ive given some views in terms of where we see the slope starting to flatten and then perhaps bend so id use that information in order to if youre interested in calculating overall indiscernible bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thank you thats helpful i guess just the spirit of the question was there isnt anything unique happening with that increase in chargeoffs that would lead to a breakdown between the historical relationship that exists between delinquencies and chargeoffs in other words the sharp increase that youre expecting in delinquencies or sorry in chargeoffs it would be reasonable to expect sort of a commensurate sharp increase in delinquencies as the data starts to come through john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes theres obviously a relationship there certainly although remember you should take into account the kind of the vintage impact and what ill say normal seasoning right so theres billion of incremental loans some of those are just going to perform extremely well and a small percentage will season out as we typically see so i would consider that in the analysis but nothing bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 got it john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services there should be no substantial breakdown bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay and my followup is if i may i might have missed this but why did an increase in earlystage delinquencies drive higher credit card nco rates this quarter and so my initial thought was that early stage delinquencies would have to flow through the various delinquency buckets before charging off so i wasnt following how that early stage increase this quarter impacted ncos just a clarification there would be great john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah yeah well theres a couple different components right theres a bankruptcy bucket theres a non bankruptcy bucket that just flows through the buckets and then theres also the recovery element so you put those three together sometimes the bankruptcy bucket is it will pop in a particular quarter depending on flow of work in a court system and the nonbankruptcy just flows quarteroverquarter so i would certainly look at this quarter prior quarter and what comes out in the first quarter and that will give you the insights youre looking for bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thank you for taking my questions appreciate it john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks bill operator thank you our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my questions i wanted to just talk a little bit more about credit so specifically i think you mentioned a little bit of mild deterioration in credit among the lower bands does your guidance contemplate that stress spreading to your prime core revolver portfolio at all as unemployment increases i guess said differently what im trying to understand is do you think we go from credit normalization to deterioration for dfs overall or is it just normalization with just the vintage seasoning impacts that weve been talking about discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes thank you its the latter it is normalization and seasoning which we contemplated fully in both our kind of origination strategy our reserving strategy and obviously in the guidance were providing roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and maybe just to clarify the lowest income segments which are a pretty small portion of our base are the ones that get additional pressure from inflation right by and large a prime book can adjust they trade down they readjust their pattern so i think john was referring to incremental stress there but theres no reason to believe that the vast majority of our portfolio will be driven by the traditional drivers of losses which is chargeoffs im sorry which is unemployment mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then i did want to ask maybe a little bit of a big picture question just longer term i think we appreciate that you have added a lot of business and increased the earnings power because some of these assets will obviously last a long time past the vintage seasoning but the portfolio has changed a lot and your guidance for the next year and it sounds like potentially even is a little bit above where credit losses have been running so maybe just remind us what is the normal loss rate for dfs or for the card portfolio or something like that maybe give us a range just trying to understand where a typical portfolio settles out is it in that low range where does that settle out thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes thanks mihir so weve been asked that question over the years many many times and what i typically refer people back to is if you take a look at the details of the kind of the chargeoff history you can go back through and see kind of quarteroverquarter whats happening on the chargeoff front you can discern kind of normalized chargeoff rate from that and then make adjustments for economic periods or kind of vintagebased seasoning mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you in regards to your employment forecast and your base assumptions youre pretty clear that the low end the assumes the to unemployment rate but can you help us understand or just confirm that the is it the higher end of the range implying a unemployment rate or some other scenario out there within your expectations discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes so the high end does not weight the entirely it actually could reflect a scenario where the unemployment is actually higher than the but it would depend on the depth of it and kind of what industry so theres multiple scenarios in there so the guidance i provided in terms of or over is intended to kind of get the kind of the meat of the scenarios that were contemplated and weighted kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then with your baseline assumption of to is that something that we make our way to throughout the year and then maintain that level or something where you expect it to peak there and then slowly drift lower thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so it would run through slowly increase through ph is how weve thought about it kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning can you dig in a little bit more on the credit card spend growth rate and kind of what youre seeing in terms of any pattern changes i think the last update through november showed a little bit of stepdown of the growth rate and can you talk about december and i think maybe you touched on january roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah ill start january is off to a very strong start so were seeing about a yearoveryear growth in sales and again reflects the new accounts we put on last year but also again for those who ph are employed a robust environment we have been seeing increases in the daytoday category commensurate with inflation and so more spending shifting there and a lot of what you heard from retailers in terms of softness around home improvement and hard goods but a lot of that was just i think some of the challenging comparisons to really robust levels from before so overall id say stable but were certainly encouraged by what were seeing so far in january donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from arren cyganovich with citi discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks on the marketing outlook you had indicated that you expect to spend more than levels which obviously was a very strong acquisition year for you whats the thought process there in terms of expecting to increase spend after such a strong year john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah great question and you know what im going to kind of give an overview on expenses and then ill specifically talk about kind of marketing and our thinking there so we said overall expenses would increase less than so what that contemplates is a doubledigit increase in marketing and single digits for the non marketing spend and what that reflects is we continue to see opportunities to acquire profitable new accounts that are consistent with what we do so that in that prime revolver category we also are intending to spend some money on the launch of the debit checking product so that will include dollars for new accounts as well as advertising to bring awareness to the product and then its important to also kind of have a view on the marketing in that this is our guidance if we see the macroeconomic environment change or we dont see ample opportunity to spend this money wisely then we will make calls in terms of the level of spend and it could be less than what weve guided to but overall were very very pleased with kind of our targeting and the effectiveness of the marketing and gave us confidence to continue to increase that arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks and then on the personal loan side you had indicated that its clear that its performing better than historically with respect to the guidance does the personal loan net chargeoff rate is that expected to go as high as credit cards in or are you still expecting it to be somewhat better john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah im going to stick at the top level of the guidance we provided and then we give details by product in the supplement i would use that information and impute kind of the chargeoff rate there but again product has been performing very very well loss rates significantly below kind of whats happening out in the industry and its a prime customer set so that should give a view of kind of at least a way to think about expectations for that product arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you eric wasserstrom vice president corporate strategy investor relations discover financial services all right todd so i think
