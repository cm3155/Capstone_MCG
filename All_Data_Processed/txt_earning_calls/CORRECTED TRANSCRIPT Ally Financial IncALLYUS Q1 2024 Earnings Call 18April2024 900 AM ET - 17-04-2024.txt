number and get into the results first quarter adjusted eps of and revenue of billion reflect solid operational execution as our teammates remain focused on priorities that are big enough to matter and drive solid returns net interest margin of was again pressured by rising rates however weve now reached an inflection point and expect nim expansion beginning in the second quarter before discussing operational results i want to hit a few notable items in the first quarter in march we successfully closed on the sale of ally lending which generated capital allows us to better serve our dealer and consumer customers we also tapped the securitization market to deconsolidate retail auto loans from the balance sheet which created incremental capital and generated a nice earnings benefit within the period strong investor interest and the earnings benefit created by this transaction are another validation the loans we originate have attractive returns and finally we recognized an incremental million of expense from a revised fdic special assessment which is not included in core results moving to operational results in dealer financial services within auto we decisioned as record million applications and booked nearly billion of originations retail auto originations had an average yield of while of originations came from our highest quality credit tier first quarter net chargeoffs of retail auto were basis points in line with the guidance we gave about a month ago insurance earned premiums of million were also a record and we see continued momentum as we grow oem partnerships and continue leveraging our expansive auto finance dealer network turning to ally bank deposits continue to be a source of strength for ally we grew deposits billion in the quarter while adding more than customers our deposit franchise was established years ago and now serves more than million customers provides stable and efficient funding and makes ally a structurally more profitable company ally credit card is performing in line with expectations as weve mentioned losses will be ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 elevated near term however we remain encouraged by its longterm compelling return profile corporate finance continues to drive strong financial results and next month well celebrate its 25th anniversary the business generated a roe in the first quarter and our billion portfolio remains historically strong from a credit standpoint lets turn to page number to talk about allys marketleading franchises last week marked years of being a publicly traded company and the transformation since that time has been remarkable what began as an auto finance captive is now made up of two marketleading franchises a dealercentric and diversified auto finance provider and the largest alldigital direct us bank with more than million customers and billion of retail deposits our dealer financial services platform revolves around the dealer deepening those relationships and providing a comprehensive value proposition to help grow their businesses we have continued to evolve the business to find new ways to help our dealer customers while also optimizing risk adjusted returns for ally over the past years ally bank has built on its reputation as the leading innovative digital bank we pride ourselves on providing best inclass customer experiences and a strong value proposition that extends beyond rates and our deposits franchise has been the key driver for customer acquisition and engagement we have expanded our products and features to deepen customer relationships including ally home and ally invest and credit card and corporate finance are businesses that diversify revenue and improve our consolidated profitability both dealer financial services and ally bank have scale lead in their respective markets and position ally for profitable growth in the years ahead and with that id like to turn it over to russ to cover detailed financial results russell e hutchinson chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you doug good morning everyone ill begin on slide in the first quarter net financing revenue excluding oid of billion is down versus prior periods driven by higher funding cost partially offset by strong originated yields the increasing funding costs have been a persistent headwind since the tightening cycle began but weve reached an inflection point as rates have stabilized continued strength in originated yields in the auto business has positioned the balance sheet for nim expansion beginning in the second quarter well discuss asset and liability dynamics that are driving our nim expansion in a few slides adjusted other revenue of million is up from prior periods driven by continued momentum in diversified fee revenue including insurance as higher vehicle inventory balances drove higher earned premiums we continue to see expanding other revenue driven by strengthen in insurance and fee revenue streams in auto including our smartauction and passthrough program insurance smartauction and our passthrough programs are highly valued by our dealers and they drive capitalefficient revenue for ally provision expense of million increased from prior year and was down on a linked quarter basis credit performance in the quarter was in line with expectations retail auto ncos came in around the middle of our guide that we provided at the conference last month losses within the quarter were impacted by softer used values throughout much of the quarter but we did see stability in march and are exiting the first quarter flat versus december ill cover retail auto credit in more detail shortly as doug mentioned we executed another loan sale via the securitization market which drove a million earnings benefit in the quarter that was realized through the provision expense line we deconsolidated ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 billion of retail auto loans originated predominantly in with yields below our average originated yield for the year investors strong interest in our loans and the million earnings benefit we realized demonstrate the attractive return profile in a dynamic environment adjusted noninterest expense of billion was up yearoveryear primarily driven by continued growth in the insurance business controllable expenses which exclude insurance losses commission and fdic fees were down yearoveryear tax expense of million resulted in an effective tax rate of which is lower than our guide as we continue to benefit from strong ev lease originations gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of decreased basis points quarteroverquarter and was slightly above the high end of guidance we provided at an investor conference last month earning asset yields expanded modestly quarteroverquarter while funding cost increased by basis points as i mentioned earlier margin has been pressured by increasing funding cost throughout the tightening cycle but weve positioned the balance sheet for nim expansion from here strength in fixed rate asset pricing particularly retail auto loans with originated yield at will continue to drive earning asset yield higher as that portfolio naturally turns over we expect earning assets to be flat over the medium term but favorable mix dynamics will continue to drive asset yields higher as lower yielding mortgages and securities are replaced by higher yielding auto corporate finance and credit card loans turning to liabilities cost of funds moved upwards in the quarter driven primarily by higher deposit costs we moved our osa rate in middecember so our results reflect a full quarter at the peak rate and we continued to see cd portfolio yields move slightly higher as expected within the quarter we took meaningful actions to reduce deposit pricing across cds and our 100billion liquid savings portfolio weve been delighted with the trends weve seen in deposits which enabled us to move meaningfully well in advance of fed rate cuts strength in retail auto yields favorable asset mix and now having moved past the peak in retail deposit costs we are confident in nim expansion starting in the second quarter lets turn to page and talk about the auto franchise our model is simple we help our dealers sell as many cars and trucks as possible and encourage our dealers to send us all of their application volume we leverage our differentiated gotomarket approach coupling high tech and high touch to earn their partnership dealer partners delivered million applications last year and that momentum has continued in this quarter we saw million applications our best quarter ever and resulted in billion of consumer volume within the quarter strength in application flow enabled us to be dynamic in what we originate we shifted our credit mix in april of and since that time more than of our originations have been in our highest credit tier weve now originated over yields for five consecutive quarters that creates momentum which ill cover on the next page lets turn to slide to discuss retail auto portfolio yields in more detail the current yield on a total retail auto portfolio is just over while we continue to originate loans at close to each quarter as older vintages mature and are replaced with new origination the portfolio yield will continue to migrate higher given the natural liability sensitive nature of our balance sheet weve consistently utilized pay fix hedges tied to retail auto loans to reduce exposure to rising rates these hedges are serving as an effective bridge while our retail auto loan portfolio is repricing higher over time ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 we manage the hedge position dynamically but currently expect it to amortize down over time which means its contribution to nim will continue to decline the natural repricing momentum created by strong originated yields will continue to outpace a declining hedge contribution resulting in a total portfolio yield that we expect to increase to by year end and continue to migrate towards originated yield over time this momentum coupled with deposit costs that have peaked position ally for nim expansion without the benefit of fed rate cuts the other dynamic influencing portfolio yield is origination mix as we covered on the prior slide we are consistently originating more than of our consumer volume in our highest credit tier historically that tier has accounted for just under of total originations over time we do expect to migrate closer to our historical origination mix for context a shift to our historical mix would add up to basis points of originated yield today with yields on originations that skew heavily towards our assets here we are pleased with the risk adjusted yields were getting today and are not assuming any significant shift over the next few quarters but over time we would anticipate a gradual migration closer to historical mix which provides yet another yield tailwind going forward that will help offset an eventual decline in benchmark rates lets move to slide to talk about the strength of the deposits franchise ally bank was launched years ago and has evolved into the largest alldigital direct bank in the us serving more than million customers we have been intentional about creating a comprehensive value proposition that goes beyond consistently competitive rates we offer bestinclass customer service and digital experiences and over time added features and products that are important for our customers including ally invest home and credit card and we continue to serve as relentless allies to our customers with high levels of service through online mobile text and telephone as well as the consumer friendly approach to fees including leading the way on overdraft elimination this approach has led to plus customer retention rates plus satisfaction scores favorable nps and strong balance trend across every vintage since the inception of the bank and while we do not focus on accolades we do think the countless awards received over the last years validates the strength of the brand and the bank the 15year journey led to exceptionally strong performance over the tightening cycle and puts ally in a position of strength moving forward we have consistently grown deposits and seen record customer acquisition without being a top payer since the fed began tightening as we sit today were core funded with of our liability stack in the form deposits and we expect earning assets to be relatively flat over the next few years which results in less need for significant deposit growth going forward the combination of a great brand and comprehensive value proposition enabled us to lag competition from a pricing perspective on the way up and positions us to lead on the way down we took significant pricing actions in the quarter while maintaining our commitment to offering our customers attractive deposit rates and a compelling overall experience we reduced rates basis points on our most popular cd term basis points on our money market account and basis points on our 84billion savings product in terms of deposit flows we saw nearly billion of growth within the quarter while adding more than customers growth within the quarter was favorable to our expectations and positions us well for a seasonal tax outflow in the second quarter we expect deposit balances to decline in as we typically see outflows from existing customers related to tax payments given outperformance in and our fully funded flat balance sheet were not expecting to drive growth to offset seasonal taxes like we have in prior years we do expect growth on a full year basis but less than what we delivered in ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 turning to page cet1 of increased quarteroverquarter at current levels we exceed our regulatory cet1 operating minimum by billion we recently submitted our capital plan as we are scoped into ccar for and well get an updated view of our scb later this year within the quarter we closed on the sale of ally lending generating a 15basis point cet1 benefit and executed another retail auto loan sale generating basis points of cet1 the loan sale reflected strong investor interest in our loans and drove a 15million pretax earnings benefit for operating capital and generating servicing income going forward we phased in another quarter of the capital impact from the transition to cecl which was worth basis points in the quarter which was more than offset by the sale of ally lending and the retail auto loan sale one more phasein remain with total impact fully phased in by we recently announced our quarterly dividend of which remains flat to prior quarter we remain committed to acting on attractive opportunities to create excess capital to invest in our highest returning businesses and driving tangible book value per share growth over time lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends the consolidated net chargeoff rate of basis points reflects performance in line with expectations net chargeoffs were down quarteroverquarter as discrete losses in corporate finance and commercial auto in the prior period did not repeat retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points were in line with expectations in the bottom right and 60day retail auto loan delinquencies reflect seasonal trends the yearoveryear increase in 30day delinquencies has moderated for the fifth consecutive quarter and give us confidence that delinquencies are at or near peak on a seasonally adjusted basis moving to slide consolidated coverage remained steady at retail auto coverage of was unchanged from the prior quarter while our allowance was down million driven by lower balances we maintain robust retail auto coverage levels at above cecl day one partly driven by portfolio mix as weve shifted into more profitable volume over time assuming macro variables remain consistent were not anticipating much change in the retail auto coverage rate over the medium term while the retail auto coverage rate is well above cecl day one levels our midteens roe guidance does not assume any reductions in coverage from here as a reminder our cecl reserving process is a 12month reasonable and supportable forecast which assumes unemployment increasing to later this year and we assume gradual reversion to unemployment from months through lets turn to slide to discuss retail auto credit in more detail first quarter ncos were consistent with the preview we gave at a recent investor conference and we saw another quarter of declining yearoveryear increase in total portfolio delinquency as shown in the bottom left chart losses for the first half of this year will be elevated as the vintage which is producing losses above price expectations works through its peak loss period that vintage is at its peak loss period today and accounted for more than of losses recorded in the first quarter as we move throughout the year portfolio losses will be increasingly driven by more recent vintages which continue to show favorable loss in delinquency trends relative to the vintage similar to last quarter weve shown a comparison of delinquency trends for the and vintages on the bottom of the page after months on book the vintage delinquency rate is now basis points below where the vintage was at the same point of time excluding the impact of recent loan sales which skew towards high credit quality loans the gap is basis points that gap has widened since our last earnings call which showed the vintage basis points favorable at months on book i also want to point out this particular comparison after months on book is impacted by where the last day of the month fell the final calendar day of was a friday which is typically our strongest day of cash ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 collection as it lines up with the pay periods for many consumers in the final calendar day fell not only on a sunday but also a holiday as a result the spot delinquency rate for the vintage after months was elevated as we move into the first few days of april the gap between and vintages widened further so we remain confident and vintages will perform favorably to the vintage that is driving higher losses today in addition to delinquency and loss frequency trends we continue to closely monitor the impact of used values on loss severity values were weaker for much of the quarter which drove losses slightly higher than expectations but we saw a nice rebound in march which has persisted through the first half of april used vehicle values have since rebounded and are now flat to year end as we begin the second quarter used vehicle values have been choppy however we continue to expect the ally use index to settle out around by the end of the year which would imply a to decline from where we are today based on actuals and elevated loss content from the vintage our estimate of losses is up marginally versus january to approximately for the year importantly we remain pleased with the impact of curtailments over the past months and performance trends on recent vintages lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was lower yearoveryear driven by higher provision expense and noninterest expense provision reflected elevated net chargeoff performance compared to the prioryear period noninterest expense is up yearoveryear as we navigate a period of elevated loss content driving higher servicing costs other revenue of million is up million year overyear as we continue to focus on diversifying revenue with fee income our smartauction and passthrough platforms are great examples of how we help serve our dealers while also generating capitalefficient revenue smartauction enables dealer to dealer transactions generating fee revenue while providing realtime data on market pricing and trends despite pressure on industry volume smartauction grew revenue by between and through whitelabel relationships we see more opportunity to grow this business and deliver incremental fee revenue while strengthening our dealer value proposition with a focus on increasing application volume our passthrough program is yet another way for us to deliver enhanced value to our dealers for certain loans that do not meet our underwriting criteria we pass through those applications to our partners for loans that are ultimately funded by our partners ally receives an origination fee and generate servicing revenue without using any capital smartauction and passthrough revenues are expected to grow to million in up since both products demonstrate the strength and scale we have in the marketplace and are a winwin for ally and the dealer lease portfolio trends are on the bottom right dealer and lessee buyouts declined to but remain elevated compared to historical levels turning to insurance results on slide core pretax income of million included the highest quarterly premium earned since our ipo insurance losses of million are up million yearoveryear driven primarily by growth including higher insured values and higher weather losses we saw solid operating leverage within the quarter as premiums earned increased by million while acquisition and underwriting expenses were up modestly total written premium of million increased yearoveryear as we see continued success in expanding our allin dealer value proposition were seeing nice momentum related to conquest activity as we recently launched relationships with two major oems which will provide an immediate boost to written and earned premiums growth in insurance will naturally increase our noncontrollable expenses specifically commissions and losses but those are more than offset with fee revenue and importantly we have a reinsurance program in place that reduces volatility from weather losses ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 across our pc inventory exposure as we look ahead insurance remains integral to our dealer value proposition and is the main driver of continued fee revenue growth turning to corporate finance on slide pretax income of million reflects solid financial performance net financing revenue was up driven by higher average balances and higher benchmarks as the entire portfolio was floating rate our billion hfi portfolio was well diversified and virtually all first lien balances are up marginally yearoveryear but down linked quarter favorable capital markets conditions including a strong clo market led to elevated payoffs particularly within our lender finance vertical from a credit standpoint the portfolio is in fantastic shape with criticized assets and nonaccrual loans at historically low levels commercial real estate exposure makes up a little more than billion and is entirely related to the healthcare industry with a track record of delivering strong returns including in and this quarter we continue to be excited about the longterm trajectory of this business as we celebrate its 25th anniversary mortgage results are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of directto consumer originations reflective of the current environment and our predominantly variable cost structure our heldforinvestment assets continue to decrease quarteroverquarter as loans mature and we operate the business on a primarily originate to sell basis our mortgage hfi assets will continue to decrease as we remain disciplined in allocating capital to our highest returning businesses and managing the duration of our balance sheet mortgage remains a complementary product for our deposit customers who accounted for the majority of our originations in the quarter we are committed to providing a bestinclass customer experience and operational efficiency ill touch on the outlook before we move into qa weve been pleased with the execution of our business and our outlook for this year and beyond remains consistent in terms of net interest margin first quarter represents a trough in nim and we expect meaningful expansion from here with or without a decrease in the fed funds rate as i said before we look at our outlook under a variety of rate scenarios and are not reliant on rate cuts to get to an exit rate of to this year and we are confident we will reach nim run rate in late in terms of quarterly cadence it wont be a straight line as things like lease terminations and gain do not do have some seasonality but we expect basis points to basis points of nim expansion per quarter for the rest of the year we are increasing our fee revenue guidance from up to to up to we continue to see momentum and growth in insurance and smartauction and the auto passthrough offerings which drive durable revenues with minimal capital requirements in insurance specifically we are seeing pc exposure increase through higher dealer inventory levels and our new business conquest which immediately increases revenues continued expansion insurance is driving the only change to our operating expense guide controllable expenses are still expected to be down but as weve talked about in past growth in pc does add commission and loss expenses so total expenses are expected to be up less than yearoveryear which is up slightly from the original guide importantly net changes in insurance are immediately accretive to pretax earnings as the revenue will more than offset the expenses this is a trade we will take all day and thats the guidance we continue to give our insurance teammates ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 no change to the expected consolidated loss rate of to and as i mentioned we see retail ncos around up marginally from approximately in january the continued runoff of the vintage and the favorable performance of the vintage is expected to drive a seasonally adjusted loss rate down later in the year and while structural supply and demand dynamics continue to give us confidence in the path of used vehicles over the mediumterm volatility in the shortterm will certainly impact our loss performance we continue to expect the balance sheet in total to be pretty flat for the foreseeable future with favorable mix dynamics contributing to nim expansion on the tax rate weve adjusted our full year guide to reflecting one quarter of actual and a rate of around for the rest of the year ev lease originations are the largest driver of the tax favorability we saw this quarter to the extent we continue to see strong momentum here we may outperform that guide for the year we remain confident that we are on a path to a run rate with nim of eps and midteens return as we have said before the timing of fed rate cuts will impact the timing of our expansion in but not the destination we will remain focused on executing on our scaled franchises taking care of our associates and customers and being disciplined in allocating our resources including capital ill close by echoing dougs comments that were excited to welcome michael rhodes to ally and we are confident in allys ability to deliver for our shareholders for many years to come and with that sean ill turn it over to you for qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thank you russ as we head into qa we do ask the participants limit yourself to one question and one follow up elizabeth please begin the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of moshe orenbuch with td cowen moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks i guess the question that seems to be the theres such a strong origination yield and yet it feels like youre letting theres opportunity to do more and so the question is i guess is that in fact the case and you did talk about the ability the stuff that youre doing in your highest tiers versus the rest of the credit spectrum is there an opportunity to do more and perhaps sell those loans to keep your balance sheet flat as your plan is that something that youre considering doing during or russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks for the question moshe moshe i agree with you the competitive environment remains favorable to us both the mix that were getting with continuing to get in stier as well as the strong originated yield that were seeing are both testament of that and so we agree with your sentiment on the competitive environment and the opportunity set remaining rich for us as you know as youre well aware were dealing in a capital constrained environment with the expectation of regulations coming down the pipeline all very manageable and as you also pointed out weve been weve also been opportunistic in terms of looking for opportunities to really leverage our dealer relationships and our balance sheet so you saw us deconsolidate over the course of fourth quarter and this past quarter billion of auto loans through sales in the securitization market those transactions were wellreceived were seeing strong appetite you saw us take a 15million earnings benefit this quarter on the sale of billion of loans to the securitization market again testament to the attractiveness of our loans in the capital markets we will continue to look at opportunities like that and we will continue to look at whether its deconsolidation through securitization well also look at credit risk transfer transactions as ways of freeing up rwa in order to redeploy in the business so i think we are in agreement with you and we continue to pursue opportunities opportunistically douglas timmerman a interim chief executive officer presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc i would just add whats unique and obviously ive been doing this for a long time plus years so obviously competition often times softens during call it tougher credit environments but today its different its also softening due to the fact that theres a change in regulatory environment coming out so everyones seeing that impact of the capital of what it is so from my view the opportunity for us is actually going to last longer than what you normally would see so we feel really good about the competitive environment really good about our ability to continue originating at a high level and very importantly originate at high yields moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks and maybe as a followup the vintage performance that you discussed is there a way to kind of separate out how much of that is a result of kind of that better more of your originations coming in the higher tier ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 pricing or just kind of fundamental better performance from borrowers that you originated in and can you relate that to your comments about a flat reserve russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah maybe ill start and doug can chip in here but i would say when we look at the performance of our book i would say delinquencies are elevated across the book across vintage and across credit tiers and we are dealing with a customer that is struggling with inflation all that being said when we look at the difference between the vintages versus i think what were seeing in that improvement is the effect of curtailments that weve been putting in place over time and as you know weve been kind of ratcheting up the level of curtailment over the course of so we take a lot of confidence seeing that differentiation between the vintages and as you would expect we look at it a pretty granular level looking at vintages on a monthly basis on a quarterly basis and really kind of analyzing and understanding the differences in their performance in terms of both delinquencies and also net chargeoff levels which are also important so hopefully that addresses your question but i think the delinquency issue is one the delinquency issue and the elevated credit that were seeing is across all vintages and across all credit tiers but i think the main driver has been the level of curtailment that weve put in place over the course of douglas timmerman a interim chief executive officer presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc yeah i agree obviously its twopronged its curtailing those segments that are underperforming the most thats our opportunity to be able to move to a better quality mix which gives that the benefit we have relative to our application flow but i would also say that very importantly we view credit to be very manageable and confident that the appropriate adjustments have been made and those adjustments are accounted for in our vintage operator our next question will come from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning doug good morning russ douglas timmerman a interim chief executive officer presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe to start off a twopart question so you reiterated the margin guidance i noted you still expect by end of next year russ how does the cadence in and differ under higher for longer and forwards and then second i think you recently decreased the savings and money market rates again for the second time in recent weeks are these cuts there to offset margin weakness in other areas or are they actually additive to the nim and does this actually improve the level of the timing you get to that and i have a followup ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great question thanks ryan maybe ill just start on the by end of in terms of nim as we said on the call and weve said before our guidance of million to million exit rate at million to million does not depend on rate cuts so that guidance is intact even if we are in an environment were at for the remainder of this year as you know we took opportunities at the end of last year effectively putting on additional hedges in order to take that risk rate off the table for the course of really what were talking about is the timing within in terms of getting to the margin and as you can imagine we run a range of rate scenarios and that certainly impacts that i think based on kind of where we sit today our expectation is we get to the nim towards the end of but again no impact on even if were flat through the course of this year on bank deposits and our deposit rates you are correct we took another basis points off our savings product thats billion of deposits we took that off this morning that is just in response to the fact that weve seen strong deposit flows even coming through tax season now we feel great about where we are we feel great about our bank franchise and about just the general level of engagement among our customers id say at this point sitting here in midapril its hard to say if that just reflects kind of lower rates and higher nim going forward or what weve done is weve really just kind of taken advantage of the opportunity and pulled it forward somewhat but id say just sitting right here we feel great about the franchise and about the stickiness of our customers and about just the overall competitive environment for deposits ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color russ and maybe a question on credit so i think you noted delinquencies are near or at the peak on a seasonally adjusted basis and you said that as we move through it should be more driven by recent vintages so can you help us think about losses over the next few quarters i think you noted that seasonally adjusted losses should be down later in the year can you maybe just put a finer point on that when do we actually see the shift happen from underperforming on a seasonally adjusted basis to actually outperforming thank you russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah its through the second half of this year as you know the auto asset is great and that you get a really good sense of how credits developing over the first months right thats when our loans typically hit peak loss rate the vintage was large and as weve said before its a vintage thats been particularly impacted by the current environment and its where were seeing losses that exceed our price expectations and so as we get through the first half of this year as we get through june we should be through that and we should see more of our losses actually driven by our and then increasingly by our vintages as you know weve ramped up the level of curtailment over the course of were seeing that benefit as we look at chargeoffs and ncos and so our expectation is as that vintage becomes more dominant in terms of driving our losses well start to see that performance improve ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 thanks for the color russ operator our next question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning doug you mentioned how different this time the competitive dynamics are im just curious as we think about competitors possibly even considering reengaging with the market like how easy would it be to come sort of disrupt what you guys have in terms of the situation right now im just trying to think about where they stand in terms of dealer mindshare obviously the dynamics are so strong and put you in a really good position right now douglas timmerman a interim chief executive officer presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc yeah i think the big part of our secret sauce obviously is decades of being very consistent and focused on the things that dealer truly values application flow is the differentiator for us as russ indicated in his comments we ask the dealer to send us all the applications were willing to do the work we dont want to miss out an opportunity to help them sell another car and truck we dont want to miss out an opportunity to capture business that resonates very well with the dealer but the dealer is not going to give that opportunity to some multiple providers and because of our relationship we get that advantage so thats a big differentiator versus the competition sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and russ could you just talk about the loan sales i just want to make sure i understand what happened this quarter versus what you might do in the future in terms of magnitude was there any gain on the sale of the loans and maybe as we look ahead should we expect the economic dynamics to sort of shift as you consider more of these types of things and sort of what kind of magnitude could these loan sales take thanks russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look i think its a fair question weve been pretty opportunistic and so we havent committed to any volume and youll see that we did loan sales in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year were not going to do them every quarter and were also looking at different ways of doing it so for example if we do a credit risk transfer transaction its a kind of different impact in terms of the balance sheet and the pl versus the loan sale and so yes this is going to be a little bit kind of lumpy but we think this is an important tool for us to have as we look at managing capital and positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the market today and also better serve our dealers if you just kind of turn to the loan sale we did this quarter we sold billion of loans there was a million earnings benefit and that earnings benefit is effectively the net benefit given where we hold the loans including the reserve and provision impact and so that million benefit was realized through the provision line but that is a positive pl event for us and again reflects strong investor interest in the overall loan portfolio i would say the loans that we sold they were predominantly vintage there was some older stuff in there from and as well so the blended yield as we said on the call was lower than what were currently ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 originating in the market today and so again we feel good about the economics we got given the yield on the loans that we sold so again strong investor interest well continue to be opportunistic well look for more opportunities to do this and its all good and allowing us to capture opportunity and better serve our dealers sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question will come from the line of jeff adelson with morgan stanley jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question russ i know the forward curve has sort of eased the expectation for cuts recently and i know youre still looking for the by the end of without rate cuts but if the forward curve does come through do you still think theres an opportunity for the to come a bit earlier in the year ignoring the lumpiness that might be having on a quartertoquarter basis russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc i think right now were on track for by the end of and so we feel pretty good about that we do run a variety of reasonable rate scenarios here and we feel pretty good about end of under a range of scenarios including scenarios where were flat for the duration of and again we think weve kind of taken that risk off the table for this year in terms of its impact on our yield jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc and on the remarketing side i mean it seems like you guys have seen some real strength in the lease termination volumes lately i think thats coming off the back of the originations you did a couple of years ago and i think the lessee dealer buyout figure dropped the most its dropped since you started disclosing that can you just talk a little bit more about the outlook there is that something that could actually maybe help your nim going forward even as used car prices continue to kind of moderate is there maybe like a kind of goldilocks type zone there where used car prices moderating is actually something that helps you as more consumers are bringing their cars back to you russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc i think lease terminations can be a little bit lumpy and thats one of the factors that contributes to the lumpiness in terms of our nim progression and thats why we give you that basis points to basis points yeah id say if i look over the course of the first quarter lease terminations were actually weak towards the beginning of the quarter and kind of came back towards the end and so we saw that lumpiness quite frankly even within the quarter you know i think on the contractual buyouts i think we expect the level of contractual buyouts to continue to normalize particularly as used car prices reached that level that weve been talking about thats all obviously thats all stuff that will ebb and flow over the course of the quarter and over the course of the remainder of the year but i think weve priced in kind of reasonable expectations in terms of how we set the guide around just the kind of ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 the overall of lease terminations and the level of contractual buyouts again normalizing and used car prices normalizing around that level jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you operator our next question will come from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp one more question around loan sales russ whats the rate limiting factor today thats preventing you or keeping you from doing more loan sales and taking advantage of this competitive opportunity that you guys are highlighting is it demand from loan buyers or investors is it pricing is it something else russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc no weve seen really great demand from investors i think weve been weve been able to get done what weve tried to get done in each of the three transactions that weve completed so far i think were we feel pretty good about what weve done again we dont set targets on how much want to do in a given quarter or given year but again we continue to feel pretty good about what weve done and we feel pretty good about on the other side of it what were originating and how it allows us to support our business robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks and then how much more room do you think you have with respect to deposit repricing especially as fewer rate cuts are now being priced in and then maybe to follow on from that what degree of deposit repricing is included in your outlook for the nim expansion and the exit rate in the fourth quarter russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc look weve been really pleased with the amount of pricing flexibility weve gotten so far as we pointed out on the call we took we started with cds we took basis points off of our 12month our most popular cd product weve taken off liquids we took another basis points off of our savings product this morning we continue to feel great about the deposit flows were getting and so weve seen the competitive environment for deposits has clearly eased ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 our own demand for deposit growth has obviously changed as well being funded by deposits with a flat balance sheet expectation going forward and so we feel pretty good about where we are as i said to ryan earlier its hard for us to say at this point whether what weve done is we just pulled forward cuts to pricing that we would have made later or if were on track to a lower place id say our overall forecast in terms of exit rate is conservative we consider a range of different rate scenarios including the possibility of fed funds being flat for the remainder of the year and as youd expect our pricing assumptions actually change depending on the actual path of fed funds and the overall competitive environment so its hard to give you kind of one because we look at a lot of different paths but again through a range of paths given the quality given the strength of the repricing were seeing on the auto loan side given the hedging portfolio that we have in place we feel pretty good about our exit rate and our overall nim guidance for the year robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you operator our next question will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research securities bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning doug and russ a flat reserve rate versus falling dq rate formation suggests growing conservatism whats the trigger that would give you comfort allowing that reserve rate to drift back down to day one levels and let me flip the question are you seeing anything that could lead you to have to take reserve coverage higher from here russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc i think as we said on the call our expectation is well keep that reserve coverage flat i dont think it reflects any particular conservatism on our side quite frankly its kind of how were running the business today and it reflects in some ways the fact that as we look at the assets were originating today versus what we would have originated in say we are focusing on a product with a richer yield and that carries more credit with it and we think were getting more than compensated for the additional credit that were taking but its a different mix and a different place in the credit spectrum than we would have been in bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and interest rate risk you guys put on the hedge in part as protection for a higher for longer rate environment and it seems to have performed as intended how are you thinking about any potential future incremental hedging activity as the rate environment evolves russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc were pretty happy with the performance of the hedges i think theyre performing as intended they are a bridge for us right they bridge to that kind of natural portfolio turn over to the more recent higher yielding originations at this point our expectation is that we will allow those hedges to amortize and that were kind of in the right place ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 in terms of bridging that portfolio turnover but obviously we manage dynamically and well continue to kind of assess the situation as we see market dynamics play out bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my questions russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks bill operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi chase haynes q analyst evercore group llc hey hows it going this is chase haynes on for john pancari i want to try to get a sense for consumer auto loan demand just given what youre saying about elevated insurance premiums due to those higher inventory levels is that due to a decrease in demand that youre seeing in big ticket items or is that just a normalization effect and do you expect consumer auto demand in the go forward quarters to kind of remain where theyve been at or decrease or increase a bit russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc well i think its a little bit unique to us because if you look at our application flow and what weve been hitting records quarter after quarter after quarter so were getting a greater market share of application flow which obviously gives us significant kind of up if you will relative to what we can originate and then of course if you put that on top of a competitive environment that is very constructive for growth those are the real two drivers but i think the general market is such that i think volumes would be pretty consistent or flat but i think our ability to do more is heavily driven just by the fact that were driving that increased application flow chase haynes q analyst evercore group llc got it thank you guys russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc that of course also allows us to be selective as to where we want to play on top of it so sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thank you doug its already top of the hour here so thats all the time that we have for today as always if you
