meaningful growth through deep and expanding relationships with our private banking and commercial bank businesses private banking loans grew by billion or during the year to billion at yearend these loans which are primarily collateralized by marketable securities make up more than of total loans and we see ample runway to continue growing this business and dominating our position in this market private banking loan applications in were up yearoveryear almost twice the rate of growth in and we expanded our referral network to financial intermediary firms this business contributes meaningfully to our companys exceptional asset quality metrics and low credit costs commercial loans grew during the year and an annualized during the quarter through broadbased growth in many of our strategies commercial and industrial growth during the quarter outpaced our real estate lending with continued strength in established and enhanced products including equipment finance and our offerings for financial service companies commercial real estate lending continued to grow meaningfully as we supported our existing and new clients turning to credit the quality and depth of our commercial lending relationships and our fundamental underwriting are also important factors in our sound credit quality our commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios remain well diversified by product as well as by geography we historically had limited exposure to some of the businesses that have been more negatively impacted by covid19 like hotels and shopping centers additionally we are pleased that the overwhelming majority of our clients we work with to provide covid19 deferral agreements were able to exit these arrangements prior to yearend we have remaining deferrals as of december totaling million or of total loans as planned and previously communicated we adopted cecl as of december and reported an allowance for loan losses of just under million representing basis points of commercial loans our reserves reflect our differentiated and highquality loan portfolio our loan growth was matched by strong deposit growth reflecting continued progress in the strengthening and broadening of our overall client base and channels we achieved record annual deposit growth in and delivered annualized quarterly deposit growth of more than for the three months ended december treasury management deposits grew nearly during the year and an annualized for the fourth quarter our strong loan growth and deposit cost and volume management contributed to our expanding net interest margin in the fourth quarter and more importantly supported record net interest income of nearly million in up from quarterly net interest income grew more than annualized from the linked third quarter and our margin expanded by basis points during the fourth quarter this strong net interest income growth along with performance of chartwell continued swap fee activity and fees from our growth and treasury management services led to annual total revenue expansion to the companys highest level yet with in the rear view our confidence in our unique business model has been reinforced it was tested and proven and were eager and optimistic about the significant opportunities ahead having raised more than million in capital in alone were well positioned to accelerate tristate capitals growth in more specifically were focused on the following financial performance goals in growing total revenue at to rate over managing expense growth to a doubledigit rate over

some to before turning to qa id like to introduce tristate capital bank president and ceo brian fetterolf who will be touching on technology initiatives underway which we anticipate will have a significant impact on our success in and beyond brian brian s fetterolf director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc great thanks jim good morning everyone well as jim mentioned we wanted to share with you a deeper dive into our banks technology strategy and investment approach including what we have planned for these are all also included in the financial goals that jim shared this morning as a quick backdrop to investment decision process we always start with addressing why what and how or as our favorite phrase from jim would be what needs to exist to make it happen i reorder these a bit here for this presentation though so to start off why do we invest in technology its important to note that our clients and financial intermediary network are at the heart of every decision that we make we are constantly driven to meet and exceed their needs and expectations and find every feasible way to accomplish this as we prioritize our investments that provide clients with the user experience and level of personal interaction that they prefer help them to more effectively manage their business and financial lives and make it increasingly easier for them to do business with us refer business to us and engage more meaningfully with us our high performing team and culture are major differentiators for us to achieve these standards of client experience were always looking for ways to improve our ability to personally engage with our clients and meaningful needs and through continuous process improvement we accomplish this guided by our continuous goal for bestinclass scalable operating and risk management platforms to not only protect and benefit our own business but also those of our clients and relationships as well so how do we invest in tech well our agile tech strategy is a major tool we use to meet these goals and help each of these stakeholders we believe our technology investments have strong return because we target them to directly maximize our competitive advantages help us address our more complex and valueadd markets target niche user experiences and empower our branchless business model also we approach our tech development strategy using a design model which maximizes our internal expertise and provides us access to bestinclass external expertise we work with the perspective of our premier clients we overlay our industry expertise in our niche markets that have developed over the life of our company and we acquire exceptional product design and project management capabilities to create the most impactful solutions we ultimately outsource the actual tech and software development phase by partnering with top firms to deliver on our design vision so we believe that our approach is the most costeffective framework to deliver the best customized solutions feature scalability maximum optionality and minimum legacy constraints for the future and jim has talked a lot about dealing with those in the past tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 what have we done so far as weve shared with investors before our proprietary paris technology empowers us to deliver premiere risk and compliance management through daily monitoring of the securities and collateralized or private bank loans this was a gamechanging investment early on in the life cycle of tristate capital that dramatically contributed to our ability to dominate this business in the independent channel growing loan balances by just over the last five years and growing even more significantly the number of clients intermediaries and loan book at that time our investment in our treasury management tech platform has positioned us to compete with the services and experiences provided by the bestinclass large banks while maintaining our focus on high touch with our clients since we initiated our specialized focus on growing this business in we have delivered the scale and customization for clients with operating balances ranging from million to over million in addition our tm deposit growth in alone weve grown the number of tm clients by over ph tritm 1633accounts by and tm clients by over just since alone weve also talked about the release of our digital lending platform for our private bank lending we designed this to position the financial intermediaries and our clients for better liability management in parallel with their investible asset management we designed the dlp to provide the independent broker dealer advisory and trust company channels with a securitiesbased lending experience that exceeds what they might have or actually may have had for those transitioning advisors at a wire house or bankowned securities firm the dlp has been totally embraced and private bank applications increased by a record last year compared to the dlp was also integral to how we were able to communicate and help these advisors work with their clients to manage the market volatility in with perfect maintenance execution were continuously improving each of these platforms but clearly they then establish us powerful for the future and establish our ability to be agile and effective investors in technology so what are we going to do next and what are we going to invest in well we couldnt be more excited as we look forward to and beyond as jim mentioned accelerated many aspects of our business and these accelerations confirmed the business and use cases supporting our rapid and impactful investment in tech solutions some of the highlights for our initiatives include our paris which is our to initiative primarily that reinforces its stateoftheart functionality and performance but also enhances and scales our analysis monitoring and loan origination capabilities for the huge opportunities we see ahead of us our expansion of our frontend technology is continuing with particular focus on selfservice selfanalysis and communication capabilities for the private bank lending through the dlp and our treasury management and high net worth deposit clients through online banking through an initiative we introduced in we are growing the robotic process automation in our middle and back office and our risk and compliance management environments with the goal of being entirely digital we are enhancing our commercial loan system by partnering on development with fiserv to facilitate our growing commercial and private bank loan portfolios support our growth in more specialized products such as equipment finance and fund finance that jim mentioned and more efficiently service our growing opportunities to agent lending transactions for our larger clients tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 and finally through an initiative introduced in we are building out our data management and analytics capabilities through enhanced modern and scalable technology platforms as we look to help our clients and partners as well as us to capture revenue opportunities this is really powerful now especially as we reach critical mass in the numbers of clients transactions and engagement in our business these technology plans mentioned are incorporated into the financial goals that jim shared this morning and theyre a significant contributor to the positive operating leverage that we see in and theyre a significant contributor to the development and growth of our business on the top line we have a great team of innovative people working on delivering this we are pleased with our success so far were never satisfied with where we are but we are more excited than ever by the potential we have with that jim ill turn it back to you james f getz chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you brian we are wellpositioned to deliver even stronger performance moving forward as we sustain our investments in the proprietary technology and superior talent that distinguish us from peers and the industry tristate capital was built to endure and we firmly believe that this companys best years lie ahead id now ask the operator to open up the lines for questions and answers operator question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc great thanks good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning matt brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc good morning matt olney q analyst stephens inc so to start with i guess with the adoption of cecl would love to hear more about expectations for provision expense in and obviously its going to be a function of loan growth but just want to understand other key tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 factors that could impact this especially with the unique loan portfolio that tristate has with the private banking loans thanks david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah matt were pleased with how our investment in the talent and our unique culture in terms of our approach to credit pays dividends in terms of the strong credit quality we have because of that discipline and the investments we make we expect our annual credit costs will remain well below peers our allowance as jim had indicated stood just below million at yearend weve not seen any notable defaults or losses emerge to date and as jim indicated our clients continue to navigate the current mixed economy quite well and so while we remain comfortable with our credit book and are proud of the history of only million of chargeoffs in the past years we want to continue to make sure that were well positioned to handle any potential issue with respect to the economy and things that may emerge we provided guidance in with respect to provisions primarily because of cecl implementation and our election to defer that implementation i dont think were going to provide concrete guidance this year i would tell you that we would expect credit costs to be significantly lower in versus and the primary factors that we focus on in driving that determination are anticipated improvements in unemployment and anticipated improvements in gdp james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc matt this is jim i would also indicate to you that as one of our financial performance goals we noted that we foresee the loan portfolio growing to and we fully believe that the private banking portfolio make up about of this portfolio with the end of the at the end of the year matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful thank you for that and then i guess shifting over to other financials it looked like the tangible book value per share was higher than my expectations and i think the consensus as well any more color you can give us as far as the tangible book value per share as of and is there any more incremental dilution or impact from the capital raise in or are these fully captured in the number david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc no it should be fully captured in the number matt what will change between q4 and q1 is the number of average shares outstanding which will impact some of those calculations the average shares outstanding will probably move up near million shares outstanding for the first quarter versus what was probably closer to million in q4 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thank you very much operator the next question is from daniel tamayo of raymond james please go ahead tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys thanks for taking my question james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc hi dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to talk about the margin net interest margin you saw some nice expansion in the fourth quarter with deposit costs coming down and loan yields hanging in there as you mentioned that they would can you talk about what you expect to see from here kind of assuming a similar rate environment do you still expect it to be able to get back to the range by the end of the year david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc daniel we do as you saw we were able to deliver on what we shared with you last quarter which was margin expansion in the fourth quarter i think jim mentioned that margin expanded basis points even in this flat environment we do see expansion in primarily driven by deposit cost reduction so where you were at about basis points on deposit costs in the fourth quarter we see that dropping to low by yearend and anticipate the average for the year will be somewhere around basis points on nim specifically we see a nim of approximately basis points by year end for the bank and probably in the mid for the holding company brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yeah and i would just add to that obviously nim is a function of asset size as well deposit size as well as the rate so obviously i think what weve demonstrated in was our ability to raise liquidity when we wanted it and then also to manage those levels of liquidity by working really highly engaged with our clients so our goal in is to continue to match liquidity with our ability to put it to work but yet really meaningfully grow our deposit franchise we have so i think there are two levers there that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter that well continue to be really good at in daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats terrific this is more of a modeling question but the other noninterest expense line ticked up a little bit more than i expected in the quarter what was in that whats the driver of that increase david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc daniel if youd allow me to step back and just put extensions and context for the year then id be happy to answer your question its important to start with the mandate we set out for ourselves at the beginning of the year which was the ph chief expense growth under we were able to do that we achieved the lowest expense rate growth in our companys history since we were able to do that while making investments to tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 build and grow our company invest in people and technology focused on regulatory compliance and delivering a distinctive client experience revenue was a bit challenged in which led to some higher efficiency ratios but with the growth in revenue that we anticipate and our focus to drive operating leverage in we expect to grow expenses by about to and naturally drive a lot of operating leverage which will improve the efficiency ratio and the ratio of non interest expenses to average assets with respect to other expenses specifically there are a couple things in there the provision for unfunded credit costs given the cecl implementation drove some of that increase expenses associated with the tax credits as you highlighted in your piece last night drove some of those increases covid19related expenses drove some of those increases and then to a much smaller extent fees associated with running a larger investment portfolio and volumedriven loan expenses drove some of that increase as well james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc dan this is jim what you want to keep in mind is that were still building this company for the future stone by stone so youll notice on our income statement we and its the reason why we brian just went over what he did with you we highlight ongoing technology and for our business to continue to grow dramatically we really have to gear up the technology that we need to put in place along with the people and thats where were investing at this time youll see the expense on compensation having gone up weve hired about new people this year alone but were also investing in the robotics that brian indicated that we can complete a lot of the mundane tasks that the people have been completing in the past when we put this company together and started doing as a private banking business it was a paperdriven business now its a technologydriven business thanks to the investments that weve made and you take a look at our growth that were experiencing on the commercial side weve linked up with the right partner in fiserv and were actually partially underwriting their investment in the development of a new system for our commercial lending area and all thats contained within that technology number that you see in front of you there daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats all very helpful i appreciate it good day operator the next question is from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys happy new year james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning happy new year michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 i appreciate all the color so far i think its an interesting discussion right the technology investments but the future scalability of it all and i know david you mentioned that you guys expect to improve the efficiency ratio and i think that that makes sense when you kind of look at everything you laid out but that also doesnt seem like maybe the best metric to kind of look at the company relative to peers right because of the aum business which i know runs a little higher so im just curious you can maybe spend a second telling us a little bit more about how you think some of the scalability that you guys expect to experience in should impact from other return metrics like roa and roe and how we should think about the improvement in this year david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so mike as we think about roa and roe well likely see roe increase before roa we believe that yields on interestbearing assets will be range bound for a period of time here particularly as we grow investments at a same similar rate as loans earnings will grow from sort of what we describe as a responsible growth strategy and will generate return on the capital that we were able to raise in and deploy that capital jim mentioned that we are a growing company and you need to keep in mind that the lag of return theres a lag in the return on that growth so if you think about the contributions of sort of a solid loan book it takes time for that revenue to materialize obviously it increases overtime pay for the cost of client acquisition capital provisioning for cecl as well as the cost of growing liquidity to fund all of this this will all increase overtime the sub debt expense is also a component of interest expense and it takes time to deploy that so weve got the economics of a growing bank as jim pointed out a minute ago and some of the expense structure that weve put in place in will pay dividends in so roe improvement before roa and i think wed id take you back to jims goals for the year in terms of revenue growth expense growth and what we plan to do in terms of the balance sheet michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sure understood and then just a clarification question on the to expense growth for the year are you guys assuming that off of kind of like millionish jump right here on or are there any other adjustments we should be mindful of david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc no i think if you just took our annual expenses for and grew that by lowdoubledigits as jim indicated thats what wed expect for the year michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it great thank you guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thanks mike tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 operator operator instructions the next question comes from steve moss of b riley securities please go ahead steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc morning steve brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc hey steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc just on the loan growth guidance here to a little bit below kind of what youve done last couple of years and even relative to this past quarter just kind of curious if you can give some color as to how to think about that i heard you jim when you said business the private one should get to but just kind of curious as to how you think on the pipeline and growth over the course of the year brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yeah i think this is brian yeah i think that to is probably a very safe baseline number but we would expect to probably push that more in the to range but i think another way to think about to is probably on an average loan growth basis so as we look at that more on an growing that across the year but we believe that we have probably the best loan growth opportunities that weve ever had as we approach the next year or so so we would not we would expect wed be over that number again i think if we look at to revenue well certainly get part of that from the margin expansion we talked about obviously well put some additional money to work on the investment side and then growing the loans over support that revenue growth steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful and then in terms of just maybe following up on the reserve ratio and credit costs here yeah i hear you guys on economy improving to help drive the provision expense down just kind of how do we think about maybe that reserve ratio heading back towards what we saw precovid in terms of maybe how long it will take to get back towards those levels brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc so i think were yeah i think were looking at a very sort of flat economy i mean from a reserve perspective i think in or as david mentioned right so thats going to be a multiyear process from our perspective were not necessarily in a rush to do any of this but again the loans we put on in again this and probably id revert back to your answer from last time that private bank loans we will continue to look to grow tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 to so out of that number that we gave to you that to loan growth significant part of that will be on the private bank side and then on the commercial side the loans that we put on this year we think yeah will be favorable under cecl treatment so we would expect that this is going to be a pretty modest year from a contribution but a revert so well start obviously reducing the percent loans provision to loans a bit through our growth because thatll probably come on a bit slower and then but in terms of actual releases i think were looking at a longer period i dont know david if you wanted to add to that david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc no i agree if youre targeting your comment to releases i dont think youll see us release reserves for a while brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yeah but from an average annual credit cost we would expect to continue to outperform relative to peers for sure james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah you want to keep in mind what our historical track record has been with regard to credit steve we havent had a single net chargeoff in the past three years and in the past five years its been million and then if you look back to the recession it was million so we have a pretty credible track record in that regard that the underwriting system that we put in place has really delivered to us and we continue to have confidence in that steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc right well thank you very much i appreciate all the color james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you operator the next question is from russell gunther of da davidson please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc hey russell russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i wanted to hey guys so on chartwell a nice finish to the year i was just wondering if you could share your revenue expectations for for that fee vertical and what the drivers would be james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah what youre going to see there clearly is the fact that their distribution network continues to perform they have credible investment performance most of the flows that we reflected to you in the presentation came into our short duration high yield product and also the value products that we have in place at the company so we anticipate a very robust year there based on performance the quality of the distribution network and the client base that weve been able to establish both on the retail and the institutional side if you look at the retail side of the business its now over of the assets and it was immaterial when we acquired the company in and you look at the institutional side of the business and it continues to grow pretty handily that million that i mentioned should be converted over in the next days and coming to this quarter david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc russell just to put some numbers behind themes that jim shared with you chartwell was able to reduce their expenses by in and at the same time their net income in was up yearoveryear their run rate revenue right now is on pace to be about million for so they had a great and theyre set up for a great russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co jim david thank you both for that and then just for my final question hoping you could talk a little bit about trends within your commercial portfolios both ci and cre and what drivers of growth for would be there thank you brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yeah thanks russell i think if we look at what we were able to do in and to roll that forward in wed be pretty happy particularly in the second half of that so on the ci side we would probably continue to see a significant portion of the growth driven by equipment finance and fund finance and these are where agile products growing industry growing demand where we can engage pretty quickly and use our expertise and networks to engage with clients certainly we want to be there to continue to grow our fundamental ci business as well i think its really going to be around finding when people want to focus on making a transition and when theyre comfortable to do that tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 but in terms of our clients by the way i mean again i think jim mentioned it in his script i mean weve been inspired and just really impressed with how our commercial clients have managed their businesses as well as their real estate development so i think that theres certainly significant opportunities with our existing portfolio to grow along with our clients as well as we come out of this so were excited by those three so theyre probably the three primary drivers on the commercial real estate side were still very excited about the opportunities that our key clients have in the geographies and the markets and again that includes sort of all of ohio pennsylvania new jersey new york and some contiguous states so as we work with our known clients or our known prospects so a pretty exclusive group of people that we work with certainly sponsordriven they are liquid and theyre finding significant opportunities in this environment so asset classes or loan types property types probably similar to what youre going to see other places we continue to focus on industrial flex multifamily and we might see some opportunistic investments for our clients in other places but were fundamentally engaged with them on a fundamentally new business i mean the other good part is were really committed to keeping the loans that we have from a refinance perspective and continue to keep that in the portfolio so the activity we need to generate in even though we are seeing it being a more competitive environment than were still optimistic that we can minimize our payoffs and where more growth falls to the net side so i think thats where were going to be able to have strong growth in operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr getz for closing remarks james f getz chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you very much for your continued interest in tristate capital and your participation today we look forward to updating you on our first
