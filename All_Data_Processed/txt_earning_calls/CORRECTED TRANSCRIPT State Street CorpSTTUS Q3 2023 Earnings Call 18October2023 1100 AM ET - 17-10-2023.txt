and good morning everyone earlier today we released our third quarter financial results as we issue these results the world has witnessed a surprise and unconscionable terrorist attack on innocent israeli citizens and the resulting enormous human toll in israel and gaza these terrible events have shocked the world and created further global geopolitical uncertainty state street stands with the people of israel and we are united with all those impacted now turning to the third quarter global financial market performance was mixed as a positive start for equity markets in july turned decisively negative as the quarter progressed against the backdrop of softening economic data market sentiment was negatively impacted by continued global central bank rate hikes and investor concerns of a higher for longer interest rate environment and an economic hard landing state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 as a result equities fell while global bond yields continued climbing around the world reaching levels not seen for many years with the us 10year yield reaching its highest level since despite these factors the third quarter continued to be characterized by relatively low currency market volatility turning to slide of our investor presentation i will review our third quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail beginning with our financial performance third quarter earnings per share was or excluding a loss on sale from an investment portfolio repositioning which was a notable item in eps growth yearoveryear excluding notable items was driven by our significant common share repurchases during the period coupled with a increase in total fee revenue this fee revenue growth reflects higher servicing and management fees better front office software and data fees and an increase in other fee revenue taken together the benefit of share repurchases and improvement in fee revenue more than offset lower nii market headwinds within trading businesses as well as the impact of yearoveryear expense growth that said we are pleased with our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives which help us to contain that expense growth while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses turning to our business momentum within investment services total auca increased to trillion at quarter end and we recorded billion of new asset servicing wins during the third quarter largely driven by wins in official institutions and private markets the estimated annual new servicing fee revenue to be recognized in future periods associated with asset servicing wins amounted to million which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in over two years demonstrating our ability to achieve our ambition of driving stronger sales performance encouragingly alphas momentum continued in we deepened relationships with existing mandates and recorded two new alpha mandate wins including our first alpha for private markets mandate for one of the worlds most influential investors during the third quarter we outlined a number of strategic focus areas for our investment services franchise as we aim to drive opportunities across key regions and product areas and realize the full potential of our state street alpha value proposition importantly we are taking actions aimed at gaining market share and reinvigorating revenue growth we are executing against our plan to improve core back office custody sales performance as it is our largest revenue pool installed quickly has significant scale and drives highmargin ancillary revenues as an illustration of our custody sales momentum in the power of alpha in the third quarter state street and vontobel a premier global asset manager headquartered in switzerland entered into an agreement to expand our existing front and middle office relationship by providing back office services subject to the necessary approvals state street had no relationship with vontobel until discussions began in around alpha resulting in the adoption of our front middle and now back office services key client wins such as vontobel demonstrate how alpha can establish broaden and deepen client relationships further positioning state street as our clients essential partner it illustrates the value of the alpha proposition and confirms our strategic rationale of how alpha can grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of state streets capabilities in a true one state street solution for our clients from front to back accelerating the alpha sales cycle state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 and implementation timeline particularly back office services remains important strategic priorities to drive even more fee revenue growth turning to our front office software and data businesses crd continues to perform well and has a strong pipeline by the end of the third quarter annual recurring revenue for our front office software and data business increased by yearoveryear to million at global advisors assets under management reached trillion at quarter end supported by a record billion of net cash inflows in importantly our cash business gained market share in an expanding market driven by strong investment performance coupled with the higher yield environment in aggregate global advisors gathered billion of total net inflows in record quarterly flow performance in cash was partially offset by outflows in the institutional business coupled with the impact of risk off market sentiment in our etf business in while our etf franchise saw modest net outflows in aggregate in our us lowcost spdr etf franchise continued to be a bright spot generating billion of net inflows gaining further market share to drive continued growth in we reduced the price on lowcost spdr portfolio etfs demonstrating our commitment to delivering institutional quality investment solutions at competitive price points lastly on business momentum i am proud to highlight that state streets foreign exchange business has once again been recognized as the industry leader after being ranked number one fx provider to asset managers by euromoney magazine in this year euromoney magazine fx awards named state street as the winner across four categories including best fx bank for real money clients best fx bank for research best fx venue for real money clients and best fx bank sales turning to our financial condition state streets balance sheet liquidity and capital positions remain strong our cet1 ratio was a strong at quarter end well above our regulatory minimum this strength has enabled us to deliver against our goal of capital return to our shareholders in we returned billion of capital buying back billion of our common shares and declaring over million of common stock dividends this means that cumulatively over the last four quarters to the end of september we have returned approximately billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends as we look ahead in the fourth quarter it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization of up to billion for subject to market conditions and other factors to conclude amidst the challenges of the market environment in we remain dedicated to driving stronger business momentum and improving fee growth to that end in the third quarter we outlined our sharpened execution plan for the investment services business underpinned by a number of actions aimed at accelerating sales and revenue growth while simultaneously improving the discipline and accountability for this execution our laser focus on expense discipline also remains high we have a wellestablished track record of re engineering our processes and transforming operations to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth in the third quarter we reduced expenses quarteroverquarter and announced another step in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model while enabling even greater investment in our business state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives we are streamlining our operations in india have now assumed full ownership of one of our joint ventures in the country this consolidation will continue the transformation of state streets global operations and enabled us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in now let me hand the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone ill begin my review of our third quarter results on slide we reported eps of which was down yearonyear due to the impact of the million loss on sale in connection with the repositioning of our investment portfolio which will benefit nii in future periods eps was up yearonyear at excluding the repositioning which you can see on the righthand side of the page turning to the core business as you can see on the left panel of the slide total fee revenue grew by yearon year driven by growth in our front middle and back office investment services business as well as solid management fee performance at global advisors this performance enabled us to offset some of the industry wide headwinds we saw in our global markets business as well as lower nii given the mixed macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter lastly we remain focused on managing costs in the current operating environment limiting expense growth to just this quarter and achieving productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver a positive fee operating leverage in turning now to slide we saw periodend auca increase by on a yearonyear basis and sequentially yearonyear the increase in auca was largely driven by higher periodend equity market levels and net new business quarteronquarter auca increased primarily due to client flows and net new business while net new business was positive longterm flows in the asset management industry have been muted as you can see on the bottom right of the slide this risk loss settlement leads to the current headwind across the servicing industry at global advisors periodend aum increased yearonyear and was down sequentially relative to the period a year ago the increase was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels and inflows of billion notably in the quarter our cash franchise continued to perform strongly generating a record billion of net inflows as our competitive performance contributed to market share gains quarteronquarter aum increased mainly due to lower quarter end market levels turning to slide on the left side of the page youll see third quarter servicing fees up yearonyear primarily from higher average equity markets net new business and the impact of currency translation partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments normal pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed client transition sequentially total servicing fees were down primarily as a result of the lower client activity and adjustments and the previously disclosed client transition partially offset by higher average equity markets state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 as ive mentioned over the past year we continue to see lower levels of client activity and flows all of which impact transactional volumes leading to a to percentage point headwind on servicing fees yeartodate part of this is the cyclical nature of the servicing business the full year effect has ranged from minus to plus percentage point impact over the last five years within servicing fees back office services were generally consistent with total servicing fees middle office services which is part of the alpha proposition had another quarter of good growth on a yearoveryear basis middle office fees were up and up sequentially largely driven by net new business on the bottom panel of this page we highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter we won billion of new auca we onboarded roughly billion of auca in the quarter primarily in the asset management client segment and importantly as ron mentioned we achieved new annual servicing fee revenue wins of million this quarter which will be recognized in future periods these servicing wins underscore the progress were making towards stronger sales performance while weve historically only described wins in auca terms we recently expanded our disclosure to indicate that a healthy level of annual servicing sales is in the million range this year you can measure us against this benchmark we now have about trillion of assets to be installed and about million of servicing fee revenue to be installed as well turning to slide third quarter management fees were million up yearonyear primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into nii quarteronquarter management fees were up as a result of higher equity market levels and record quarterly cash net inflows as you can see on the bottom right of the slide our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broadbased business momentum across each of its businesses in etfs we had neutral overall flows but saw positive net inflows and consistent market share gains in the spdr portfolio lowcost suite as you know we strategically dropped the fees on about a third of our lowcost suite of products and expect more growth in the coming quarters from this action in our institutional business notwithstanding net outflows of billion in the quarter which were primarily driven by client insourcing both our defined contribution and index fixed income products continue to drive strategic momentum lastly across our cash franchise we saw record quarterly cash net inflows of billion as we captured some of the cyclical movement of cash in financial system ill just remind you that cash flows can be volatile quarterto quarter turning now to slide third quarter fx trading services revenue was down yearonyear while up sequentially relative to the period a year ago the decrease was mainly due to lower direct fx spreads and lower fx volatility partially offset by higher volumes quarteronquarter the growth primarily reflects higher volumes industry volatility is down to across developed markets and emerging markets relative to the period a year ago and down to sequentially which is presenting fewer trading opportunities and lower spreads securities finance revenues were down yearonyear due to lower specials activity and lower agency balances sequentially revenues were down primarily as a result of seasonally lower activity and the recent industry dropoff of us equity shorting activity and specials state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 third quarter software and processing fees were up yearonyear but down sequentially largely driven by crd which ill turn to shortly other fee revenue increased million yearonyear primarily due to the tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative marketrelated adjustments moving to slide youll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased yearon year primarily as a result of higher growth in our more durable softwareenabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implement more clients to the saas environment which now accounts for about of our clients partially offset by fewer onpremise renewals sequentially front office software and data revenue was down primarily driven by lower onpremise renewals partially offset by higher softwareenabled revenues our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our charles river development front office solutions products turning to some of the other alpha business metrics in the right panel we were pleased we had two more mandate wins in the quarter for alpha most notably we also had our first alpha for private markets win we also meaningfully advanced crds institutional fixed income capabilities turning to slide third quarter nii decreased yearonyear and sequentially to million the year onyear decrease was largely due to the continued mix shift from noninterestbearing deposits to interestbearing and lower average deposit balances partially offset by higher interest rates sequentially the decline in nii performance was primarily driven by lower average deposit balances in the deposit mix shift partially offset by the benefit of higher interest rates including international central bank hikes and our investment portfolio repositioning the nii results were somewhat better than expected due to noninterestbearing deposit levels coming down slightly less than expected and the portfolio repositioning partially offset by client repricing some of which will be delayed and will impact fourth quarter instead on the right of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter with average deposits declining quarteronquarter cumulative us dollar client deposit betas were since the start of this recent cycle while cumulative foreign currency deposit betas for the same period continue to be much lower in the to range finally as i mentioned earlier last month we executed an nii accretive and capital accretive investment portfolio repositioning exercise to take advantage of both higher yields and spreads which all else equal should drive nii towards the higher end of the previously disclosed range of million to million per quarter next year turning to slide third quarter expenses excluding notable items increased yearonyear sequentially third quarter expenses were down as we actively manage the expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts all while carefully investing in the strategic elements of company including alpha private markets and technology and operations automation on a linebyline basis yearonyear compensation and employee benefits increased primarily driven by salary increases associated with the wage inflation higher head count and the impact of currency translation sequentially however we brought head count down and we also reduced incentive compensation this quarter in line with our yeartodate performance state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 information systems and communications expenses increased mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts insourcing and vendor savings initiatives transaction processing increased mainly reflecting higher subcustody vendor costs occupancy increased as we relocate our headquarters building and other expenses were up mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees moving to slide on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide as you can see we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels which remain above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of was down basis points quarteronquarter largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher rwa partially offset by retained earnings our lcr for state street corporation was a healthy and for the state street bank and trust in the quarter we were quite pleased to return roughly billion to shareholders consisting of just over a billion of common share repurchases and over million in common stock dividends over the last year ending september we repurchased approximately of shares outstanding finally a few brief closing thoughts before turning to outlook our third quarter performance was solid with fee revenue growth of yearonyear we executed on our plan to improve sales capacity and reported million in new servicing fee wins in the quarter as we look towards our goal of million to million in servicing fee wins in and as you have seen us do for the last years we again demonstrated expense discipline while continuing to invest in the business next id like to provide our current thinking regarding the fourth quarter at a macro level our interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards we currently assume global equity markets will remain flat from now to quarter end which implies the daily average is down about quarter onquarter bond markets are also expected to be down about on average quarteronquarter regarding fee revenue in on a yearoveryear basis we expect overall fee revenue to be flat to up year overyear with servicing fees approximately flat and management fees to also be flattish as we expect the year onyear business drivers similar to what we saw this quarter we do expect fourth quarter sales momentum to be similar to the strong sales performance we saw in the third quarter we also expect that our markets businesses will be down modestly yearoveryear given lower volatility we expect software and processing fees to be up to largely due to the timing of onprem renewals and the expected new saas installations and we expect the other revenue line to come in at around million to million in the fourth quarter regarding nii we now expect nii and we now expect nii to be towards the middle of the million to million range we previously mentioned this includes continued expected rotation of about billion to state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 billion out of noninterestbearing deposits and the impact of deposit pricing which we previously noted but with more stability in the total deposit averages turning to expenses we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and expect to maintain relatively flat expenses in quarteroverquarter as always this is on an ex notables basis and in this regard we are keeping an eye on the likely fdic assessment and we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for will be around and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen i will now conduct a questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from mr alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning hey good morning thanks everybody hey ron and eric i was hoping maybe we can touch on your comments earlier around positive fee operating leverage into which is definitely very encouraging to hear after a couple of years of good cost management already so as you think about the revenue uncertainty between the markets and customer flows i guess what is the range of outcomes youre assuming for fees as you look out into and if revenues prove to be more challenging than the base case is there enough room to still deliver that positive fee operating leverage thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes alex its ron i mean were facing that comment largely on two things one is we feel like weve got quite good visibility around what were doing from a cost perspective so we feel like weve got a series of initiatives underway that will continue into on managing our costs while also continuing the investment program that weve got in place that investment program includes some investments that will drive revenues in and beyond but also the second thing its based on is some of the actions weve taken around strengthening our sales and sales effectiveness and just pointing to the results we had in q3 the note that eric just made to you terms of the visibility we have on so those two things are confidence in expenses and what we believe is a nicely developing pipeline and a set of sales capabilities and processes i mean obviously markets could turn everything upside down but based on a reasonable market forecast and not necessarily one thats going to be necessarily a tailwind we do believe we can achieve positive fee operating leverage state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thats great and i appreciate the new disclosure on the backlog and the revenue backlog definitely helpful so maybe within that can you help us maybe understand the cadence of how quickly some of that million of backlog will sort of get converted into servicing fee revenues is that expected largely over the course of some of that is going to spill into and then ultimately do you think thats going to be enough offset some of the blackrock related outflows and revenues that you still expect thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp alex its eric let me answer that from a couple of different directions to give you some texture because as we think about goforward fee revenues right part of what matters is installing the backlog part of what matters is new sales right sort of maintaining the third quarter momentum in the fourth quarter and into next year because some of those sales actually come through in the subsequent few quarters and then as we talked about back in september making sure that were very effective on our retention activity so every one of those matters in terms of the backlog we said theres about million of revenues in the backlog on the servicing fees and north of trillion on an auca basis the implementation is a little bit different in each the regards in terms of revenues we think about of that will come through specifically in the fourth quarter so thats included in our guide we expect to of the million to come through next year and then the balance in so its kind of a good mix and aligned with what wed like the auca implementation is a little more a little quicker just sometimes that happens its quicker sometimes lower thats a little closer to in the fourth quarter and around next year but those will move around as they play out but weve got good visibility now and what weve been particularly pleased with on our third quarter sales in particular but a lot of that was around back office services and back office services as you know are one of the fastest to onboard and implement and thats going to provide some momentum into the first half of alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thats great thank you very much both operator thank you and your next question comes from mr ken usdin from jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning eric just one followup at the fourth quarter nii youre expecting to be in that middle of that kind of million zone and then youre talking to the upper end for next year i just wanted to ask you to walk us through that direction of travel like what are the factors that start to turn to perhaps positive as you exit the year into next year with regard to either left side repricing or just deposits getting to the right zone just kind of walk us through the moving parts thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 yes ken its eric as you surmised there are a number of factors that matter especially at this point in the cycle as we transition from declining nii to some level of stabilization and we see a good rationale for some uptick from fourth quarter into the first quarter of next year so let me just go through them right theres a continued amount of rotation of nib noninterestbearing deposits we still expect some in the fourth quarter but we expect that that starts to flatten out the beginning of next year well see exactly how much when its hard to call and it moves around weve got quite a bit of visibility into our repricing especially for our largest and most sophisticated clients i described that last year and then were through a good bit of that we have we executed on some more of it in the third quarter we expect and we have very good visibility in the fourth quarter and so kind of the repricing effects and the catch up is kind of a bubble that works its way through on the tailwind side we then have the investment portfolio rolling through and the investment portfolio matures billion or billion of bonds quarter youve got the new bonds come on roughly at sometimes basis points higher than the ones that are maturing and so thats whats giving us a positive trajectory and so its really those three factors plus a little bit of lending growth and some of our other actions that we can control that we think starts to shape stabilization of nii as we get from fourth quarter to the first quarter but it will depend there will be some movements and as you know we update all of you as frequently as we are in public and well continue to do that but those are the trajectories and our expectations at this point ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks and my second one is just the costs were i think a little better than you had thought and youre flat to also probably a little better than the market thought and a slower implied yearoveryear rate of growth just wondering have you done anything incremental to slow the organic growth rate of expenses and is that something we should think about as go forward as well ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes ken its ron i mean theres a number of initiatives underway as we i think always talked to you about weve really got an ongoing productivity set of actions underway that is comprehensively looking throughout the organization some of the things that are underway now we mentioned whats going on in india and this india jv bringing that inside i mean this jv goes back to our early days in india before we had our own center of excellence there its going to enable us to eliminate redundancy and eliminate a lot of oversight activities so well be able to take down costs there take down repetitive costs weve got a comprehensive look at operating models throughout the business which is will start to yield results into next year were looking at some where work gets done throughout the world and are there places where we can move and combine things create more end to end so its a series of things some of them a lot of the easy work has already been done so some of these things have been the work has been underway for a while and well start to realize the benefits of it but we see visibility such that we can make the statement that we are that notwithstanding that we continue to make significant investments in the business that we feel can keep our cost in reasonable check state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and ken id just add that the other thing that we that we have bear down on effectively that we talked about over the last quarter or so is our hiring freeze i mean what we found is weve got outstanding individuals and people in our team and part of what we need to do is we reinvest in different features of the business or different areas we actually need to reallocate some of that talent to those areas and actually at the same time we need to find efficiencies in others and so thats been while it is hard work its been an effective way to actively manage our team and our human resources it still means we invest in all that we need to do for new products functionality regulatory requirements and so forth but the reallocation thats born from the from this sort of freeze is actually a very effective tool for us at this stage in the cycle ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes ken what i would add to this i think what were talking about now is the continuation of what we started going back to that was rudely interrupted by covid and everything that occurred coming out of covid the disruption the great resignation the issues that arose out of that with service quality and where we needed to overinvest to make up for some of the turnover that we were seeing that led to the kind of cost increase that you saw thats all been normalized service quality has stabilized and so i would say that were back on the path that we started back in and overcome what we saw in the kind of period ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator thank you and your next question comes from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning ron and eric and thanks for taking my questions one question on your expectations for eric encouraging to hear that you still are expecting noninterestbearing to find a stable point here in the beginning of next year but when you think about your fourth quarter expectations are you thinking that the typical seasonality that we see in deposits will come through and is that embedded within the middle of that range of million to million for nii eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric yes broadly but with the asterisk that seasonality that weve seen has moved around a bit sometimes a little stronger or sometimes its a little weaker than typical so we do see a bit of an uptick in a normalization in total deposits and so well weve guided to stabilization maybe well see an uptick well see but this is based on really quite deep analysis of our client deposit base remember we manage it on a us dollar we manage each of the foreign currencies we have just in nib for example i think we have accounts right the average account size is million weve seen the trends in the largest most sophisticated clients and largest accounts come down quite a bit the smaller ones tend to have a flatter line and evolution state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 so the guide is based on that plus a little bit of the seasonality and well just update as we go but i think we started to see some amount of inflection here but we want to be careful right theres still some amount of rotation playing out theres some amount of balances and pricing coming through a good bit of which we have visibility into but itll take a little time to just work through it in the next few months and quarters brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay great thanks and then maybe following up a little bit on kens question im sure at this point youre going through the budgeting process for do you have any preliminary expectations for what you could be looking at for expense growth operating expense growth here in the next year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its early to do that we i think what gives us confidence and actually the feel of necessity on fee operating leverage is we need to run the business in a way that is healthy for our shareholders and various stakeholders at the same time and we need to find a way through that weve certainly gone through a strategic planning exercise we do that through the summer july august and september and weve got a path forward we believe both on the top line and on expenses its a little soon to get into that but were working through that and part of what were doing now is actually making sure that we have detailed plans business by business function by function we have we run alternative scenarios we even developed contingency plans and we also we are careful about metering out our spend next year what we do add to spend were going to do that with stage gate so theres a lot going on right now and well come back with a full set of guidelines and guidance in january but i think were confident that well weve got a path forward here that will be healthy and fee operating leverage is a very good way for us to think about it and for i think for you guys as well brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thanks very much eric appreciate that color operator thank you the next question comes from glenn schorr from evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello thank you so weve discussed over time and today that the lower client flows from the market the whole active to passive trend and thats how disadvantages kind of all of us can we talk about what youre seeing in all the private markets both from a servicing standpoint and you sprinkled in a little comment about outlook for private markets like bring this to life a little bit could this be a growth industry for the next years just curious on that thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 glenn its ron obviously you know the kind of growth that the private markets have seen whether its private equity and more recently private credit infrastructure and we see none of that abating private equity may be taking a bit of a pause but all of the fundamentals point to those industries increasing and in fact many of the large if you look at some of the large multi asset managers a lot of their growth is actually coming from private much of that business today remains insourced and theres very few standards in the business a lot of it gets serviced in very expensive locations and is not a very good experience for the ultimate lp investors so its a very fast growth area for us and it becomes more important for the sponsors for the actual firms to actually get their arms around this because the average ticket size is going down years ago the lp investors typical lp investor it was an institution it was a pension fund or sovereign wealth fund today the average investor is some affluent person thats in some kind of a pooled fund and so getting this all right is actually quite important and the demand is very high for us were investing a lot in it a lot of technology in it and increasingly as these firms become multiasset not just focused on in one area the idea of an alpha fronttoback kind of thing and all thats associated with it with data becomes very important both as providers but also as investors so the opportunity here is not just the big private providers but also the big private investors the sovereign wealth funds and asset owners here so yes we see it as a very significant opportunity for us eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and glenn just to add a little bit of the kind of quantitative elements this the private markets broadly to find around the world from a servicing fee standpoint are growing in the a year we described our performance which is has been quite strong in that area and based on our client base and our pipeline our expectation is that we should be growing in the range next year part of that is because we serve so many large global asset managers who have a wide range both in traditional products and in privates right so theyre coming to us and partly because increasingly were serving the classic alternate and private organizations right who increasingly want to focus on what their core investment process is as opposed to processing and so we see more and more outsourcing and opportunities for us from that segment as well glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi maybe just one followup to all that detail you were early on the a lot of the offshore outsourcing you were early on hedge fund outsourcing and it helps you on your growth rate over time do you have a sense that youre early here do you think you have a head start and competitive edge on this private front we just dont see the same competitive landscape so im curious on your thoughts thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp its a little bit hard to tell glenn i think that we certainly amongst the traditional asset servicers we think that were early youve got some of the very focused fund administrators that do some narrow kinds of activities in there and certainly in terms of offering a full fronttoback solution that includes data as far as we can tell were the only ones out there so yes we think in general were early state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thank you for all that operator your next question comes from ryan kenny from morgan stanley your line is already open ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks for taking my question so the industry has been seeing servicing fee rate pressure for a while can you update us on what youre currently seeing in terms of fee rate repricing and are the newer wins coming in at a lower fee rate than your existing contracts or a higher fee rate eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp ryan its eric the overall cadence of fee repricings have been stable for us i think for the industry last couple of years as you know back in we went through a phase of higher repricing but theyve been relatively consistent in that kind of or so headwind level which is not that different from what it was over the last years so thats been relatively stable what we have seen is very good fee rates on new business and part of that is the discussion we just had in privates where just because of the nature the activity the servicing it tends to be a manualintensive process the fee rates are multiples of the average fee rate for our business and in fact the last couple of quarters weve seen fee rates on new business comfortably above the average that weve seen you can just do a little bit of comparison and wed be cautious about doing it for every quarter but take the last few quarters of auca wins the last few quarters of fees wins and you kind of you get to that view and weve mentioned that in ways in our quarterly reports this year in particular so i think in some ways what weve been able to find is that with alpha we bring more to a client across the auca base right so we have fees on the front office side which we disclosed separately but both the middle and the back office we have complex clients and so thats been quite fruitful for us and then the alternatives and privates is a very is a much higher fee rate area just by virtue of that industry and that together is what gives us some of the revenue kind of momentum that weve seen into the third quarter of this year and we expect in the fourth quarter as well ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks thats helpful and if we look at the quarter it looks like the servicing fee rate over average auca did come down a bit was there anything driving that is that just function of lower volatility and timing or is there anything else in that number that we should think about eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp no if you just look at the aggregates remember youve got this kind of effect where when equity markets are up right you kind of have this natural thinning in the fee rate just because of how the fee schedules are state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 structured right and theyre not quite like they are in the asset management business so thats been fairly that was expected and in line with the ranges that weve been seeing ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks thanks very much for taking my question just actually to followon on that last one eric and just doing the math just and if you can confirm if im correct on this the million over the billion is the appropriate way to look at that and that would be basis points as opposed to the million of servicing revenue be installed over the trillion representing more than just like basis point or so so i guess first of all is that are we am i looking at that correctly and is it all characterized as servicing fee revenue and guess whats driving that is that differential sort of a sustainable type of new revenue win run rate for i guess some private market types of business eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brian its eric im really glad you asked that question because with new disclosure comes sometimes very simple answers and sometimes more textured ones so what youve done is an analysis if you look at our fee wins provided by our new auca wins which on average over time ill stress that will approximate the rates that of the wins the challenge is in any one quarter remember some of what we win is on existing auca business so ron mentioned one of the global asset managers we added back office to that relationship those aucas were already in our base why because we had already been doing both front and middle office processing for them so in a way those fees wins in the quarter cannot be compared to any of the new auca thats kind of apples and oranges on the other hand sometimes the opposite happens right where were we might be adding a auca and a fee thats quite high one thats quite low because were just adding a small service and weve had some of those over the last couple of quarters so id just be cautious about the quarterbyquarter math id encourage you over time we can look at that through time but i think what wed encourage you to do is take a look at the revenue the wins on a revenue basis against the base of servicing fees right million in a quarter against the billion of servicing fees is a very healthy amount of revenue and our ability to maintain that momentum gives you an indication of the kind of sales effectiveness and the growth dynamic that we can create net of the retention rates that we need to manage to so i encourage you to spend the most time there you can do a little bit of auca wins versus the auca base that gives you another indication but id encourage you to do it in that direction because youll get a better indication i think of our momentum state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats super helpful and then the followup would be on the deposit beta the differentials between the us and nonus and weve heard this from the other custodians as well in terms of nonus deposit betas being significantly lower than us and just maybe some thoughts on as we move into this into and potentially europe maybe even higher for longer versus us potentially and should we see more aggressive or i see more incremental deposit beta moving through the nonus markets to sort of almost catchup to the us or not so much eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp our current indication and were well through the cycle in us at least we think so well see it feels like theres a little more to go on the international side and it started later so its harder to read we do see that there are some structural differences in the market around deposit betas between the us currency and the nondollar even for the same clients in some cases and part of that is just the youve got this noninterestbearing versus interest bearing construct in the us and internationally you tend to have just an interestbearing deposit construct so its a little more its a little more straightforward so as ive described we have cumulative deposit betas in the us to range we expect that will float up a little more as we kind of as the cycle lets say finishes could go up another percentage points but its starting to level off in europe were in the to range of cumulative beta i think it can go up another points maybe points well see but its not going to reach the same levels that you have in the us based on the indications we have and the way we both reprice and we see others competitively priced in the market so fairly different between the us and the international currencies in some ways that plays to thats good for us we know how to manage in both us and nonus currencies weve continued to have some tailwinds in nii in the international currencies we obviously need to make sure that we share some of that with clients but given the international composition of our balance sheet thats one of the areas that continues to be supportive of our in a positive way of our nii trajectory brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thanks very much thats great color thanks operator thank you your next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey i guess good afternoon just a couple of quick followups one on capital i think heard you regarding completing your indiscernible up to billion in buybacks for the year just give us a sense with the cet1 at close to your target how are you thinking about capital management going into next year would you rather operate with some amount of excess capital as you look forward to some of the macro uncertainties relative to just continuing buybacks and paying out any excess state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp let me start on that ebrahim we its eric capital is one of the most important elements of the balance sheet and we spend a lot of time thinking about what are the levels of capital how to manage and it is based on facts and circumstances right the economic environment the uncertainty our confidence in earnings and earnings momentum what we can see in the strength of our balance sheet right were incredibly liquid and we have a very upmarket lending book which is quite high quality so many things come together i think what weve laid out on the page on capital in the materials is that our minimum requirement is we tend to run with a very healthy buffer above that weve got a target range in the to and weve been way above that range partly because of a little bit of history over the last two years and we bring that down but in both at pace and also in a thoughtful way i think what youll see us do and i get i say this is given what we know today because were going to be careful if markets disrupt then you slow a little bit if youve got a lot of confidence in market fees and theres confidence then you might go in the other direction but the middle of that range is a good place for us to aim towards partly because you want to keep a little bit of extra thats still percentage points above the requirements on the other hand there are some uncertainties in the world and doesnt feel like we should run down to the lower end of that range right now right that feels like it would be it wouldnt be appropriate so theres a range for a reason i guess is what id say weve been returning capital at pace in the last few quarters billion or more we certainly like to continue return capital at pace you can kind of do the math of go down to middle of the range you got to remember theres pulled a par that matters from the afs portfolio that provides a tailwind and capital accretion theres earnings and then theres the rwa management you saw rwa tick up a little bit this quarter our goal is obviously to continue to optimize rwa and turn that into an advantage as well so we see quite a healthy buyback going into the fourth quarter weve got authorization plenty of authorization to deliver on that we know its important to our shareholders and have i think a good path forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and thanks for walking through that eric and just a followup quick question around nii or i guess as youre thinking about alco management is there as things reprice on the asset side within the securities book are we kind of holding duration relative to where the back book is will at any point the thought process evolve to adding duration im just wondering how youre thinking about the cycle the environment we might be for next few years and how that informs the duration youre willing to take on eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp ebrahim the answer is all the above so every one of those factors matter if we get more steepness to the yield curve right that would encourage us to add some duration at the right time we want to we may need a little more duration to protect against falling rates right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc right state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thats what you want to ideally be ahead of that on the other hand rates could move upwards further and so you want to be careful i think were careful in how weve configured the portfolio you saw us do some of the repositioning we unwound billion or billion of bonds weve reinvested towards the middle of the curve but also at the frontend right we have so its not just an average duration position that we are focused on but where are the points across the curve and then theres a whole window of work that we do around the us curve the euro curve and then the other foreign currencies and then theres also a mix of duration clean duration we put on through treasuries and some of the convexity products like the agency mbs so theres a wide range but its an active discussion id say at alco and one that we think will both be we think of it both on an economic basis but also on a risk management and protective basis that well have i think quartertoquarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator thank you your next question comes from steven chubak from wolfe research your line is already open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good afternoon thank you so much good afternoon eric i want to ask a followup on the new revenue disclosure in the past you spoke about the level of gross asset flows that would be needed to offset natural attrition in the business in a similar vein i was hoping you could frame the level of gross revenue wins that are required to offset natural attrition recognizing for i think it was brians earlier question that fee rates will certainly vary depending on new wins but anyway you could frame it in that context would be really helpful eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah heres what i described in the past we talked about auca wins we had talked about weve got trillion of auca wins a year thats kind of volumetric benchmark and as some of the discussions weve had typically we winning on average higher than the current fee rate and so you can kind of work through that on the fee revenue side and this is really around servicing fees our goal for this year is to deliver about million of servicing fee wins and you can compare that to the trillion of sorry billion of servicing fees for the year and that kind of gives you a sense for ill call it gross revenue wins as ron described weve got a series of initiatives some of which are already playing through around adding to sales capacity sales effectiveness product feature functionality and so forth state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 and part of the disclosure that we provided just last month was that while million of servicing fee wins is appropriate for this year wed like to get closer to million to million next year and again you can kind of compare that to the billion of servicing fees and that kind of gives you a sense of gross fee revenues i think the followon work you want to do is just think about the other drivers of servicing fee revenue growth on a net basis right there is typically some amount of attrition we said wed like to have retention at so we can think about servicing fee attrition thats about million a year is a way to compare the gross wins versus the gross losses and then theres some amount of fee headwinds which is about a year that weve described so what were trying to do is create clarity for all of you on the elements of that growth kind of the growth algebra ill say it in an analytic manner so that you can see where were really focused and every one of those levers matter we have tens efforts on each one of those but its that mix of activity and the sales servicing fee sales in particular that will help us then deliver a core organic growth from year to year to year and a good way for i think us internally to be clear about what we need to accomplish and externally with you all as to what the bar is for good organic growth and success steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thanks for that color eric and if i could just squeeze in one more clarifying question there was a lot to unpack in the response to ebrahim around capital management it does appear given the buyback level assuming you execute on the million in its entirety that youll be at the lower end of that to range of cet1 recognizing therell be a pulltopar benefit but should we be anchoring to the to payout that you guys have managed to in the past just recognizing that theres not as much excess if youre going to run at those levels eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think for the rest of this year the analytics id encourage you to do is to think about where we ended third quarter kind of the middle of the range and thats not necessarily a point but the range to the middle of the range for fourth quarter theres pulltopar rwa management that gives us quite a healthy amount of buyback and i think the continuation of something thats quite accretive to shareholders that is substantial in terms of capital return i think once we get to the middle of the range then were more likely to be the that over level of earnings but i think and thatll be probably how we think about next year but thats next year i think theres i think we have good visibility into a good and healthy amount of capital return and comfortably over what weve committed to ill call it in the medium term steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc really helpful eric thanks for taking my questions operator thank you your next question comes from mike brown of kbw your line is already open state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for squeezing me in so multipart question here on the asset management business so first it was just great to see the money fund flows come in this quarter and you mentioned that you believe there was some market share gains there can you just touch on what contributed to those gains and maybe some thoughts on the coming quarters and then i look at the equity side and consistent with the industry there was pressure on the flows whats your thoughts on maybe when investor sentiment could improve and flex there and then just last part here when you take a step back and you look at ssga today is there anything strategically that could be interesting to you from an ma perspective to help bolster the asset mix or accelerate some of the future growth potential in the business thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp mike its ron so theres a lot there in your question i think on the cash business i mean this is a core competency that weve had for a long time and its also weve built up the capability both on the investment side and really on the distribution and channel side so weve got distribution and if you will kind of hooks in the water in many different pools and thats including by the way lots of connectivity into the core custody business so as youve seen for example rotation from deposits weve captured some of that in the money market business but the a lot of it most of its been external most of its been around investment performance and kind of being where the money is flowing the other areas that are also growing dc is growing and has been growing for a while share has continued to grow there in the dc investment only and thats been very much product and product innovationdriven ssga was one of the first to figure out how to put an annuity product into a target date fund did it actually before it got the broad regulatory goahead to do that and thats actually now a source of real growth so we see that as a growth area the defined benefit just goes away and people realize that longevity protection is something that people need i think that combination of a target date fund with some kind of insurance longevity product will be important and weve got real distinctive expertise in that in terms of the growth areas i mean theres we are really for the most part an institutional shop weve built out the product capabilities in the retail and the intermediary space yiehsin hung who joined us as ceo late last year shes got a lot of expertise there too so some of it will be just moving and expanding share in the retail intermediary space and then theres a real move into blending the line between public and private markets and the and the belief that those lines really dont make sense in the blended products where youve got sufficient liquidity but enable those that dont need the liquidity to take advantage of the illiquidity premium so some of this will be in product design whether thats organic or inorganic i mean we think theres opportunities in both and theres the teams got lots of product development going on so were fully committed to that business we see lots of growth in that business and excited about the prospects there michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you ill leave it there operator thank you the next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities your line is already open state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well its been a long journey for you guys to get the fronttoback solutions in alpha and im just trying to figure out how much traction that has and where were seeing that in the financial results on the one i hear your excitement and you have alternatives now part of that program and youre guiding for positive fee operating leverage and you have all these new mandates on the other hand i look at the fee growth this quarter it wasnt that great right and so are we seeing evidence of the fronttoback momentum in the results is it something that you expect to see or is simply such a long sales cycle that we should be thinking two three four years out thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp mike let me just start and maybe address the journey here because this was not something that you bought off the shelf it was actually something that nobody had ever done before so there was an awful lot of development that we need to do and i think we signaled that at the beginning i mean charles river was an important acquisition but to be clear that was a front and in itself needed some investment particularly in the fixed income area so much of what weve been doing over the last several years is selling and developing many of the early particularly some of the early large ones were explicit development partners we targeted them they targeted us and came in as development partners with the idea that they would help us to build this out theyve been its purposely taken longer because theyre the ones that are actually helping to shape what the overall thing will look like this has been a very very big year eric alluded to it in terms of some of the features and functionality particularly around fixed income and getting up to not just par but to a market leading position in terms of fixed income capability so in terms of just getting the program up and running were actually quite pleased with where we are i dont think we would have thought back in when we launched this that wed have the number of clients that we do now the other thing that were convinced of but we had to prove it to ourselves was that this could be a tool to actually generate new clients that it wasnt just a way to solidify existing relationships but it was a way to actually grow share and ship share and thats what were starting to see now vontobel was one theres others in the pipeline so its a journey that we believe well see revenue growth at an accelerated rate and maybe ill leave it there eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and mike its eric on the financials its a very fair question i just remind you the context for the current year because there is some other large movements on servicing fees so if you think about it we recorded a growth in overall servicing fees but there were tailwinds and headwinds away from the kind of organic new business creation thats important that we need to demonstrate year after year the market tailwind for yearon year for this quarter was about percentage points of servicing fees so youd say hey where is that part of that was about percentage points of headwind came from lower client volumes and activity right a little bit of what we described as weve seen less trading activity out there which is which comes and goes tends to be cyclical and then the other thing we did see this year and this quarter is that previously disclosed client exit was worth almost percentage points as well state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 so there are i think some larger move of headwinds and tailwinds in particular flowing through the financials net new business if we just want to take a look at that was a positive percentage points yearonyear this quarter and thats where wed like to see the value of alpha the value of traditional servicing fee sales the value of private servicing fee sales and part of reasons why were adding to our disclosure is to make that more apparent to everyone over time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just one followup eric and then ron just the exit of that large client what inning are you in as far as thats concerned and then ron as it relates to accelerating revenue growth from the long journey of alpha timing are we thinking quarter year several years eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah on the previously disclosed client were out through that very roughly the bulk of that will come through next year and then theres another theres just because of how yearonyear comparisons work youll get a tail into ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah and mike just can you clarify the question i just want to make sure i understood mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah my initial question was fees arent growing that much and eric identified some headwinds to that but you talked about the financial benefits from alpha the increased activity to result in accelerating revenue growth i was just wondering a timeframe around that statement that revenue growth should accelerate due to the benefits of alpha ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes so i mean as we signaled i think at the beginning i think probably i think it was out my answer to alex the were telling you that we believe were going to achieve positive fee operating leverage theres revenues there and theres expenses there on the revenue side we believe weve got a program in place that includes alpha thats going to enable us to do that some of that is driven by alpha some of thats driven by actions that were taking some of which have been implemented others that will be implemented this quarter and into next in terms of strengthening sales and revenuerelated capabilities so what you should be hearing from us is confidence around our revenue growth generating capability some of it related to alpha some of it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 related to the core business and what you should also and the point we normally dont go into a client example that we did there but its such a pure example of the strength the vontobel example is such a pure illustration of the strength of alpha because its an institution we had no relationship with we began the relationship with our front and middle office and then we have brought along the back office which it felt as you know mike as well as anybody generates other kinds of ancillary revenues so this is thats an illustration of how alpha is enabling us we believe to pick up share that we wouldnt otherwise be able to pick up and to do it in a way thats distinctive from our competitors mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator thank you your next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc your line is already open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi eric hi ron eric can you share with us i know youre im not asking you to go into details on your budget for the upcoming year but could you frame out for us though the outside factors that influence the budgeting process on expenses such as wage inflation or other types of inflation do you feel like theres less pressure going into versus this time last year when you were doing your budget eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric yes the headwinds have lessened theyre still there but theyve lessened if you think about it when we were doing the budget for it was the fall of we actually at that point had done two formal merit increases that year some of which were going to then play through on a carryover basis for so that was partly a headwind and then we had larger than probably typical merit increase by a little bit in the spring of this year in so thats were not in that environment anymore we certainly want to reward our employees with annual merit increases but much more in line with what weve done over the last five or years as opposed to something that was much higher so thats on the kind of wage side benefits were actually continuing to see some amount of inflationary activity medical claims dental et cetera as youd expect i think thats pretty broad based so but thats probably similar to prior years and then i think the interesting area where were doing a lot of work on is all the nonpersonnel spend right our various partners and vendors and software licenses cloud computing costs right every one of those is an area for us to think about whats appropriate and so we have weve been having those discussions this summer and this fall and well continue to have them into the winter around next year were seeing inflationary increases the way we were a year ago there a little bit less so but i think were still seeing higher than wed like inflationary increases there and so important questions are how do we offset them how do we use technology if it is a little more expensive to drive increasing process engineering and automation how do we partner with fewer suppliers in some cases and get the benefits of our scale so theres a number of initiatives that were working through but thats one that takes some more in a way thats part of what we do during the budget process state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup obviously our industry the world has gone through an incredible turmoil in the last three or four years with the pandemic and such and now were in this interest rate environment that we have not seen since prior to the financial crisis and if we assume that the fed is higher for longer lets say its to for an extended period of time versus the bps to bps that you all had to operate and the industry operated at post financial crisis going into where we are today how is that or is it changing some of the strategies you may pursue now that the rate environment is not possibly not going back to the basis points that we were accustomed to does that change the way you approach the business or approach your customers that you couldnt do because rates werent at this level three or four years ago eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric i think it has several impacts on us which actually in aggregate tend to be positive for how we manage and engage on our business very tactically higher rates and especially some steepness in the yield curve we talked about earlier gives us some ability to add duration and feel like thats valuable so theres some tactical effects there i think more broadly with higher rates the value of cash in our ecosystem we described trillion of cash in our ecosystem across deposits money market and cash sweeps and our asset management business our repo activity our platform sweep activities is trillion to us cash is valuable for our clients to keep especially in risk on versus or especially in risk off and riskon environment and they want to be rewarded for it but it also means theres a whole cash wallet out there that for us is a way to engage with clients right we as a bank whove got not only the banking offering of deposits but the capital markets offering of repo money management offering of money markets and cash management to us its a way to deepen our relationships with clients so i think over time youll see us add to our product offering some of thats quite broad today but well think about how else do we integrate cash into say the alpha proposition is a way to consider it how do we think about it in terms of our platforms and our markets activities a number of those are important cash generators and then i think at the most senior levels with our clients the continuesuite actually cares about cash today they care about who they keep it with how its masked how they are remunerated how its safe but also how it can be redeployed and so its become a real csuite discussion in a way that we think can strengthen both our relationships given our broad offering but also one that becomes more and more of a business activity and a business growth activity over time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate the color thank you operator thank you there are
