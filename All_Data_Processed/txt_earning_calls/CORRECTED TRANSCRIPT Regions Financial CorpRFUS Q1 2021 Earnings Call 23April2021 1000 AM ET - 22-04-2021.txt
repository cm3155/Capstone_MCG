you all for joining our call today we kicked off on a solid note earlier this morning we reported earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of our ability to continue to deliver value this quarter is a testament to both the investments weve made as well as our associates unwavering commitment to our customers and communities our credit metrics continued to improve and reflect the good work weve done with our clients coupled with the expected benefits from government stimulus based on this quarters credit performance and the improving economic outlook we reduced our allowance for credit losses by million more than net chargeoffs while still maintaining one of the strongest allowancetoloan ratios in the industry at although we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic our ongoing conversations with customers reflect optimism about further economic recovery and growth vaccine distribution is improving in our footprint and businesses for the most part had reopened the majority of our largest deposit states are experiencing unemployment rates significantly below those of the us as a whole and our loan pipelines are improving as we are seeing more activity in the marketplace were increasingly optimistic this momentum will continue throughout this recovery and beyond we will maintain our focus on deepening relationships with our customers by providing personalized financial guidance combined with excellent technology solutions that continue to make banking easier now david will provide you with some details regarding the quarter david j turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average and ending adjusted loans declined from the prior quarter new and renewed commercial loan production increased compared to the prior quarter however balances remain negatively impacted by excess liquidity in the market resulting in historically low utilization levels as of quarter end commercial line utilization was compared to our historical average of just a reminder each of line utilization equates to approximately million of loan growth commercial loan balances continue to be impacted by the companys ongoing portfolio management activities and ppp forgiveness timing average consumer loans again reflect a strong mortgage production offset by runoff portfolios overall we expect full year adjusted average loan balances to be down by lowsingledigits compared to although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by lowsingledigits with respect to deposits balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels led by growth in the consumer segment reflecting recent government stimulus payments the increase is primarily due to higher account balances however we are also experiencing new account growth we expect nearterm deposit balances will continue to increase particularly as recent stimulus is fully disbursed and corporate customers maintain higher cash levels lets shift to net interest income and margin which remain a significant source of stability for regions net interest income decreased on a reported basis or excluding the impact from day count and ppp ppp related nii declined million from the prior quarter as the benefits from round two were offset by slower round one forgiveness two fewer days also reduced nii by million the decline in core nii stems mostly from lower loan balances and remixing out of higheryielding loan categories net interest margin declined during the quarter to cash averaged over billion during the quarter and when combined with ppp reduced first quarter margin by basis points excluding excess cash and ppp our normalized net interest margin remained stable at evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a nearzero shortterm rate environment similar to prior quarters the impact from historically low long term interest rates was offset by our cash management strategies lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges cash management mostly in the form of a december longterm debt call contributed million and basis point of margin interestbearing deposit costs fell basis points in the quarter to basis points contributing million and basis point of margin loan hedges added million to nii and basis points to the margin higher average hedge notional values drove a million increase compared to the fourth quarter at current rate levels we expect a little over million of hedgerelated interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in within the quarter weve repositioned a total of billion of cash flow swaps and floors targeting less protection in and while there may be additional adjustments in the future we believe the resulting profile allows us to support our goal of consistent sustainable growth specifically we are positioned to benefit from the steepening yield curve and increases in shortterm interest rates in the future while protecting nii stability to the extent the fed is on hold longer than the market currently expects a potential for loan growth only enhances our participation in a recovering economy looking ahead to the second quarter we expect nii excluding cash and ppp to be relatively stable while recent curve steepening has helped asset reinvestment levels longterm rates will remain a modest near term headwind deposit cost reductions one additional day and hedging benefits will support nii in the quarter while loan balances are expected to remain relatively stable over the second half of the year and beyond a regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 strengthening economy a relatively neutral impact from rates and the potential for balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive growth in nii now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income decreased from the prior quarter but reflects a increase compared to the first quarter of capital markets delivered another strong quarter as customers continued to respond to interest rate changes and potential regulatory and tax headwinds fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers and securities underwriting both achieved record levels and ma advisory services also delivered solid results while we expect capital markets revenue to remain solid over the remainder of the year some activity was pulled forward looking ahead we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the million to million range on average excluding the impact of cva and dva mortgage delivered another strong quarter as we continue to focus on growing market share and improving our customer experience mortgage income increased over the prior quarter driven primarily by agency gain on sale and favorable msr valuation production for the quarter was up over the prior year setting the stage for another strong year of mortgage income service charges were negatively impacted by both seasonal declines and increased deposit balances while improving we believe changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction posting are likely to keep service charges below prepandemic levels although we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth we estimate service charges will grow compared to but remain approximately to below levels card and atm fees have recovered up compared to the prior year driven primarily by increased debit card spend given the timing of interest rate changes in combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance we expect adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year but this will be dependent on the timing and amount of ppp loan forgiveness and loan growth lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses decreased in the quarter driven by lower incentive compensation primarily related to capital markets and mortgage which was partially offset by a seasonal increase in payroll taxes of note base salaries were lower compared to the fourth quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process associate head count decreased quarterover quarter and yearoveryear and excluding the impact of our ascentium capital acquisition that closed april head count was down we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business in we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to remain stable compared to with quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses in the million to million range and while we face uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time from an asset quality perspective overall credit continues to perform better than expected annualized net chargeoffs were basis points a 3basispoint improvement over the prior quarter reflecting broadbased improvement across most portfolios nonperforming loans total delinquencies business services criticized loans all declined modestly our allowance for credit losses declined basis points to of total loans and of total nonaccrual loans excluding ppp loans our allowance for credit losses was the decline in the allowance reflects chargeoffs previously provided for stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance including the impact of the trillion stimulus bill approved in march regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 the allowance reduction resulted in a net million benefit to the provision our allowance remains one of the highest in our peer group as measured against periodend loans or stress losses as modeled by the federal reserve future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of chargeoffs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery as we look forward we are cautiously optimistic regarding our credit performance for the year while net chargeoffs can be volatile quartertoquarter based on current expectations we believe the peak is behind us and we expect full year net chargeoffs to range from to basis points with respect to capital our common equity tier ratio increased approximately basis points to an estimated this quarter as you are aware the federal reserve extended their restrictions on capital distributions through the second quarter of the federal reserve also indicated these restrictions are expected to be lifted beginning in the third quarter subject to capital remaining above required levels in the ongoing ccar cycle for firms participating we have opted into this years ccar and assuming capital levels remain above required levels and the feds stress test we should be back to managing capital distributions against the scb requirements beginning in the third quarter however our plan is to begin share repurchases in the second quarter subject to the feds earningsbased restrictions based on our internal stress testing framework and amount of capital we need to run our business we are updating our operating range for common equity tier to to with the goal of managing to the midpoint over time so wrapping up on the next slide our expectations which we have already addressed in summary we feel really good about our first quarter results and anticipate carrying the momentum into the remainder of pre tax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit quality is outperforming expectations capital and liquidity are solid and we are optimistic about the prospects for the economic recovery to continue in our markets with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is from ken usdin of jefferies john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp ken kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc sorry guys is that open to me ken usdin john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yes kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc oh my bad sorry i thought i lost you for a second thank you yeah david just wondering you made the points clearly about starting to reposition that longerterm swaps portfolio and to position for potentially higher rates how are you how do you help us think about how that changes the longerterm trajectory of recognized income versus just the hope that rates go the right way and loans are better presuming the economic recovery and in terms of just how you make future decisions on future on other potential terminations thank you david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so ken we never anticipated for all the derivatives to go to term we wanted protection and our goal is not to turn the derivatives into a trading asset but to have it help us manage the volatility of nii and thats worked extremely well for us as we think about the future we obviously look at all the data points to try and figure out when the fed may move and as we continue to have economic progress were thinking that there is more likelihood of an increase in short rates and probably loan rates to follow starting in the back half of and into and we wanted to participate in that and not have our nii being muted so we terminated the billion worth of derivatives you take whatever gain you have and you have to spread that over the life you dont get a onetime gain so we will continue to evaluate the economic recovery and well make adjustments as we go regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 along we still have protection though for and no change there its just out the curve i mean out the term a little bit in terms of really and kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and along the way obviously youre still sitting on this big excess cash position as you showed to us in your core nim can you just talk to us about how youre thinking about staging incremental use of that cash versus the hopes for loan growth that you and the rest of the industry are hoping for anticipating david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah we like many folks we had a nice deposit growth weve had billion of average cash at the fed billion at the end of the quarter we constantly challenge ourselves ken on whether or not put that to work in the securities book when of course we want to make all the good quality loans we can thats been elusive for the industry thus far and so some have deployed that in the securities book weve done a little bit but were reluctant because i was talking to our treasurer yesterday theres no free lunch here you just cant you cant hide from the risk that you take if you try to take duration risk right now and deploy in that in the securities book it will help you shortterm in nii but you will pay for that dearly down the road and were playing the long game were not about trying to generate shortterm nii growth for that sake so that being said we are challenging ourselves and as we make different decisions to get that deployed you should not expect wholesale investment in the securities book but you may see some around the edges kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks for that david operator your next question is from ryan nash of goldman sachs john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys so maybe to dig in a little bit on revenues youre off to a nice start to the year i think revenues are up over yearoveryear with both nii and fees up so can you just maybe talk through the revenue outlook a bit and where could there be sources of upside just given the fact that the guide implies a pretty strong deceleration from the first quarter and it looks like mortgage and capital markets could remain strong and then second it just seems like ppp is one of the potential swing factors can you maybe just help us understand what are you assuming for balances and forgiveness for the rest of the year and then i have a followup david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 okay so to start with the top of the house so our guide on total adjusted revenues is down modestly obviously continued to have pressure and reinvestment of fixed rate assets throughout the year we do have some obviously protection on nii through our hedging program so were excited about that from a loan growth standpoint we are in some great markets so we expect to benefit over time as our economies continue to open and we get some loan growth we have some headwinds in terms of again we continue to have capital markets at million every quarter we guided you to million to million so who knows i mean if we continue to have capital markets should be robust ma should be robust and we might be able to outperform there but we gave you the guide of million to million we think mortgage will continue to be strong our teams are performing very well in terms of mortgage and we think there could be some upside there but who knows we have to see what happens with the rate environment i think in terms of ppp we have billion of ppp loans outstanding we originated billion under the ppp2 program and we forgave about million in the first quarter the timing of that forgiveness is a big determinant right in terms of ultimate income for us we think thats backend loaded and literally in the fourth quarter before you start seeing real forgiveness as a matter of fact well have a little bit of pressure on pppgenerated revenue in from first to second quarter as we disclosed a little bit and thats only because of timing the point is if you got billion the fees and interest we earn off thats a little over its just timing when is it coming in and your guess is as good as ours on that but that will be thats a pretty big swing factor in terms of where we end up on our guide on revenue for the year ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay and then in terms of capital you just announced the to yeah you put out a release the other day announcing a billion buyback and if i look at market expectations for earnings it implies a pretty steep decline in the capital level so can you maybe just talk about expectations for utilizing the buyback assuming the fed continues to ease restrictions and where do you see you actually running with the cap story i heard you said to run in the middle but given that were entering a period of strong economic growth potential for rates rising at some point in time could we move towards the lower end of that over time thanks david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well so we had our last goal was closer to we changed our operating range to to and said wed operate in the middle over time that range can change as economic conditions continue to improve and we still have uncertainty out there so we believe thats an appropriate range and an appropriate midpoint of that at is the right place for regions at this time as conditions get better we can adjust accordingly or if they get worse well adjust that way were at today so thats basis points from the middle round numbers thats million worth of capital well continue to we didnt have buybacks in the first quarter as i mentioned we will have some in the second quarter but lets go back and remember our capital we want to use to grow our business thats its priority wed love to have more loan growth out there and use it that way were going to pay a dividend in the to of our income so that we have a sustainable dividend we like to use that capital for nonbank acquisitions like we did on ascentium capital is a good example so thats our preference we will then the last effort we will use buybacks to maintain and optimize our capital at that common equity tier so well be restricted on how much we get to do in the second quarter we think well have a very good ccar submission which gives us more flexibility to manage that to that starting in the third quarter and you should expect us to get there and fairly quickly regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john and good morning david david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc david can you touch on you gave us some good color on the loan loss reserves and i know weve talked about this in the past about your day one reserves back in january of whats the likelihood that you guys could get to that level or maybe even something less if the economy is even better going forward lets say months from now than it was back on january and the mix of business is less risky than possibly was back then as well david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well you kind of answered your own question there i think gerard and that is youre exactly right were sitting here today at coverage or if you exclude ppp our day one was and thats more akin to the by the way and so the question is when can you get back to there and i would just say we really dont think of it as back to there we think of whats the appropriate reserve we need to have based on the risk inherent in our portfolio that can change based on your profile and to the extent the profile is better than it was that january when we adopted if the environment that we expect through the whole life of the loan is better then the reserves can go below that but its all dependent on what the facts and circumstances are at each balance sheet day and so we see the economy getting better as weve mentioned its better faster than we thought were still cautiously optimistic about where this goes we need to get the vaccine out we need the economies to continue to open and if all that happens you would expect reserves to come down but right now we can only take it we can only adjust reserves based on what we see today if next quarter its better then you would expect it to come down so theres no magic in that day one that day one was based on the facts and circumstances that existed at january and if theyre better then you would expect reserves to be lower if its worse you would expect them to be higher regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you you gave us some good color on the hedging program in both your prepared remarks and answering an earlier question on the million that youre generating currently at the present time how could that number or what interest rate environment would you need to see to see that million maybe get to million or vice versa or fall to million can you give us some color about that particular amount and how its impacted by rates david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well clearly the so were receiving fixed swaps and we have floor so you earn more to the extent rates are lower than where we are today and thats pegged off of libor so libor its pretty ph doggone low so you would have to see that go to almost zero we dont have any new derivatives where we begin the notional we had some this first quarter a little bit i think really as you think about hello are we still there john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc still here david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp oh im sorry okay so i think you should think about the contribution really as a stabilizing factor in terms of nii it wasnt meant to help us increase nii it was to keep us protected in case we had an extraordinarily low rate environment like we do so being able to have million to million million each quarter is really what its about not trying to get it to be million and million gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator your next question is from erika najarian of bank of america john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i wanted to ask a little bit about the expense outlook so weve been getting questions from investors recently some of your peers indiscernible had announced higher expectations for expense growth due to accelerated investments and as i look at slide and that very consistent cagr john im regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 wondering if you can assure investors on how youve been able to keep expense growth at these low levels and invest back in the company in other words is there going to be a potential surprise with regards to expense growth going forward especially as we look forward to a stronger revenue growth environment john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp no no surprises erika we as you know announced an initiative now a couple years ago we characterize to simplify and grow we talk now about it as being about continuous improvement it was largely designed as a way to focus on how we simplify our business how we flatten the organizational structure reduce expenses to make investments in people in technology and additional capabilities and products and i think weve successfully done that to your point weve been able to keep expenses generally flat while providing increased compensation every year for the teams that remain with us investing significantly in our business hiring additional bankers and other associates who are working actively in our technology function and risk management other parts of our business and well continue to do that david mentioned this morning were committed to holding expenses essentially flat there may be some increases from time to time if revenue rises and that revenue is associated with a variable compensation like capital markets like mortgage but otherwise our core run rate of expenses should be flat and we believe that we can continue to make investments in our business while holding those expenses flat david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah erika that million to million number that we have guided to we have embedded in that the investments we want to make as john mentioned erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc perfect thank you and david second question is for you im guessing that you opted in to the ccar to optimize your stress capital buffer lower what can you do to be able to better direct the results closer to david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so if you were to look at the resubmission that we had in december you would have seen our degradation there would have put us underneath the floor of we ran our model based on the assumptions the ccar assumptions in the first quarter we believe the results will again show that we will be underneath the floor of so part of the reason we wanted to participate is because of that the other part of it is our credit has continued to improve pretty dramatically even relative to our peers and this gives us an opportunity to show you and the rest of the world that our credit has continued to improve as a result of our derisking strategy our capital allocation strategy we feel very good about that this gives an opportunity for an independent third party in this case the federal reserve to show everybody what our losses are relative to peer so were excited about participating we think it will show well we feel very good about our credit as weve mentioned in the call and we have robust reserves and capital levels on top of that so were well positioned and i think this can help us from a credit rating agency as well erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 understood thank you operator your next question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning just a clarification on the expenses for the full year obviously it implies a drop down for the rest of the year is that just lower incentive comp related to capital markets and mortgage revenues or are there any other drivers as we think about the drop down from david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah matt its that but its also as john mentioned our continuous improvement program which is were focused on this every day and so we continue to make adjustments in leveraging technology and processes and talked about head count thats part of how the head count is down as were leveraging technology so we just have an intense focus on one making appropriate investments to grow our business thats number one we have to figure out how to pay for that so we can keep our expenses relatively flat so every part of the organization is focused on expense control so that we can make that investment and i think youre going to see our expenses as i mentioned should come down to that million to million for the remainder of the year matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately as we think about loan growth picking up exiting the year obviously theres the ppp running off and the exit portfolios but what do you think will be the drivers of growth for you guys i think this year and into next year john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah matt this is john our customers are increasingly optimistic about the economy we operate in some as david said some really good markets and most of the states that we operate in were some of the first to reopen their economies as a result unemployment rates in states like alabama tennessee georgia florida are better than national average and so we see businesses expanding our pipelines today are larger than they were this time last year and that is broadbased across geography and sectors we expect to see growth as companies work through the excess liquidity theyre holding begin to rebuild inventories make investments in property plant and equipment as their businesses expand so i think there is opportunity to grow the question will be the timing of that and as david mentioned we are experiencing historically low levels of line utilization we expect our customers will get back into their lines of credit once they work through the excess liquidity that theyre holding you just dont know what the timing of that will be its largely a function of obviously economic growth were confident that as the economy expands we will grow loans separately i think well continue to see good mortgage production on regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 the consumer side and weve got some other initiatives underway related to consumer lending that we think could have an impact as well and finally were a small business were very pleased with our acquisition of ascentium capital we think that equipment finance is an important part of potential growth particularly in late2021 and and so believe all those things can be drivers of some loan growth to offset to your point the headwinds we face with ppp and some of the exit portfolios matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc indiscernible pipeline is up yearoveryear obviously covid was starting to be a drag in the comp a year ago do you happen to have that before covid john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah its pretty close to so the range kind of if i think back months or so pipelines would be reasonably comparable not quite back to late2019 but pretty near there matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay perfect thank you operator your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning back to the capital discussion i know you had indicated in terms of capital deployment potential ma interest on the nonbank side wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit on what areas on the nonbank side you will consider deals and then separately if you could just talk about potential interest in whole bank deals clearly weve seen a fair amount of activity in the southeast and a lot of banks moving towards bulking up on scale so just want to get your updated thoughts there thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah okay well with respect to nonbank weve been active over the last several years acquiring capabilities in capital markets lowincome housing tax credits capabilities equipment finance obviously with ascentium capital in wealth management highland associates or highland capital in the mortgage business mortgage servicing rights all those things reflect the kinds of interest that we still have so to the extent we can acquire portfolios acquire capabilities that we think will allow us to provide additional services to customers to grow and diversify our revenue were active and interested and well continue to be regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 with respect to bank ma our views still hasnt changed we think we have a very solid plan we want to continue to execute that plan we believe if we do that we can deliver real value for our shareholders well see the benefits in our stock price and the strengthening currency and so were watching the activity thats occurring were evaluating it trying to learn from it but our focus is on executing our plans in the markets that we operate in and we think there is a lot of value creation associated with that for our shareholders john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great thanks john and then my second question is around operating efficiency i know you indicated that your goal is to continue to produce positive operating leverage over time your adjusted operating efficiency ratio came in around this quarter where do you see that going for the full year and maybe beyond that interested in what your thoughts are for where is a fair level where that could reach and whats a good run rate thanks david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so youre right we stay focused on generating positive operating leverage over time we do that by both growing the revenue and because of the investments that were making and watching our costs we feel good about where we are with our efficiency ratio especially compared to our peer group obviously that gets more challenging as the year goes as the low interest rate environment and the reinvestment risk puts more pressure on revenue you asked about i havent gotten to yet but if you think about the industry i think weve got all work towards getting underneath that in time and lower but you cant do that until you get kind of normalized environment where you have normalized revenue and if you did that being under is going to be i think expected so in the interim you get as efficient as you can but you still have to make the investments to grow revenue and thats what were doing so weve got a number of initiatives in our continuous improvement program that will continue to help us from the cost standpoint and hopefully those continuous improvement efforts also help us grow revenue so i know i didnt give you a specific point john but well continue to work to get that number down over time john pancari q analyst evercore group llc no thanks david thats helpful operator your next question is from david rochester of compass point john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning good morning guys on the liquidity discussing earlier can you just talk about where your purchase yields are today in securities and then what you need to see on the rate front to get you feeling more regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 comfortable with shifting more of that excess cash into the securities book over time and it sounds like you dont have much of that at all in your nii or revenue guide at this point is that right david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats right weve said around the edges we may deploy some of our excess cash if you go into your general mortgagebacked day you may pick up basis points were still having pressure on the front book back book of about basis points between loans and securities so thats what weighs on us we really need to see that 10year getting to ph 2plus too and kind of stay there and feel convicted on that before we take the duration risk because we just dont want to again we dont want to make a shortterm play for nii and feel bad about that six months from now because rates got away from us and i think were all seeing the economy improve but the pace of that we can debate and where that should come a higher rate environment over time so in the interim were just going to be cautious we may pick like i said a little bit of our excess cash and put it to work but you should not expect wholesale changes through an investment in the securities book at this time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay great appreciate the color there and then for whatever reason you dont end up seeing the loan growth pan out as you expect in and maybe even into the back half of the year and the cash continues to build can you just talk about how that situation might impact that investment strategy if at all and then what are the steps you could take to offset some of that lost revenue thanks david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah we continue to as john mentioned looking for portfolios and things to really put not only our capital to work but put our liquidity to work too to the extent that deposits continue to come in at the pace they are one itd be surprising because the growth that we saw primarily this quarter in consumer came from the trillion stimulus program that we got in the quarter so i dont think well continue to see it grow at that pace but to the extent that it does and we end up our billion into fed grows materially from that then we may make different decisions but i dont think thats a very high probability wed much rather again find loan growth by portfolios and put a little bit of it to work in the securities book david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks operator your next question is from peter winter of wedbush securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i wanted to follow up on the deposit growth what i thought was interesting was all the growth came from consumer and the commercial side was down a little and do you think that could be an indicator that regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 maybe in the second quarter you start to see commercial deposits coming down and maybe you get that line draw that youre looking for in the second half of the year as the indicator david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp peter i think in the second quarter to see that all of a sudden happen i dont know we talk to our customers one onone we believe over time that theyre going to probably maintain more liquidity today than they did pre pandemic well see when we get there but thats what were hearing i think the consumer growth you saw again it was based on the stimulus that hit during the quarter so i dont expect it to have that kind of growth every quarter although were growing customer accounts too and were very pleased about new customer acquisition on the business front in terms of second quarter growth though i think its more pushed to the second half of the year as these balances get worked through their liquidity gets worked through and as john mentioned were in very good markets were excited about the growth potential here so its just a matter of time before we see the loan growth i just dont think youre going hit that breakthrough in the second quarter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then just on the premium amortization expense it was stable quartertoquarter at million if the 10year were to increase closer to about level where does premium amortization expense go down to david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think if we were to be that high were probably down million maybe millionish somewhere there in there peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks very much operator your next question is from jennifer demba of truist securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks lets go back to everyones favorite question on ma what would compel you to change your stance on the whole bank ma would it be that you cant get below that efficiency ratio over the medium to longterm or is there something else that you think could compel you to change your attitude there john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 yeah i think if our view out over the next three years thats our strategic planning horizon was that we couldnt continue to deliver improving returns for our shareholders that we werent going to perform relative to our peers well then i think we would have to consider a variety of alternatives but today when we think we see a path to continue to grow revenue we believe we can continue to make meaningful investments in our business while holding our expenses relatively flat and we think all that is a path to generating nice returns for our shareholders and so our perspective is unchanged but to your question its possible and thats why we continue to follow the market try to understand what others are doing and how transactions get structured so were not totally its not as if were not paying attention i guess would be my point jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay second question is on credits just can you give us some color on how your more covidsensitive borrowers are doing now indiscernible john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah again in the markets that we operate in those economies are open and people are beginning to move around theres a lot of pentup demand and as a result we see hospitality sector whether it be restaurants or hotels continuing to their performance continuing to improve probably the biggest challenge they face is workforce and hiring people to work heard a number of stories sort of anecdotally over the last twoplus weeks about restaurant service being slow in so many places because restaurant owners are having difficulty bringing in their workforce back but people are getting out and theres i think significant indicators that people are going to be traveling a lot this summer and so again thinking about the markets we operate in that bodes well for those economies the energy sector is doing better for sure so all in all credit continues to improve and based upon what we know today wed expect that trajectory to continue jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc indiscernible operator your next question is from bill carcache of wolfe research john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp bill good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning john and david can you give us an update on how regions is thinking about the use of its balance sheet in conjunction with partnerships with finance technology players how important is it for regions to own the customer relationships versus whats your willingness to give certain parameters for the kinds of loans that youre interested in originating to finance technology partners and letting them originate those loans for you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah very important to us to own the relationship and we have experimented with partnerships and in every case what we were seeking to determine was could we leverage that partnership back into a relationship and where you see us beginning to exit those partnerships it is because we awfully concluded that they werent relationshipbuilding opportunities we are looking consistently to expand our capabilities to think about how we potentially acquire platforms that we would own that would allow us to originate credit as an example to companies or individuals who hopefully could become would become customers and ascentium capital is a great example of that that company had some really good technology a platform to originate credit made it easy for customers we liked it we saw it as an opportunity to acquire the technology and the capabilities that that very experienced team had to help us grow into the small business space to with companies that could potentially become regions depository customers regions wealth management customers and so thats i think the way youll see us continue to use our balance sheet is to build relationships bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood separately your rationale behind wanting to get your stress capital buffer below makes sense simply because of what it signals in terms of credit quality relative to your peers but can you discuss from a practical perspective what the significance is given your intention is to run with around cet1 so having the stress capital buffer on top of your minimum would set your minimum capital level at but since your intention is to run with around anyway is it really that big of a deal to have a little bit higher scb maybe youre looking longer term to a goal of lowering your cet1 target over time just if you could speak to that would be helpful david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp you get the prize of the question of the day and youre exactly right in todays environment the scb for us really doesnt come into play because theres no way in the world wed have our spot capital below i think as an investor most investors would have a conniption fit if we did that so that was just a piece of it because but it sends a message when your peers are all under the floor of and youre at it kind of sends this message that your credit quality is worse we dont believe that and we wanted a very public opportunity to demonstrate that and thats really what this was all about so i wouldnt say that that gives us an opportunity to run our capital lower we think our in the middle of our range is the right number for us at this time based on the risk we see in our business if over time risk changes the outlook changes we might operate lower than that but from a practical standpoint were not going to get anywhere close to the spot and so youre exactly right it wasnt done just for that purpose john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp the only other thing id add is every time we participate we learn something and i think it helps us continue to develop our thinking about how we manage the risk in our business the composition of our business the impact of various stress scenarios on our portfolios all those things are constructive and in addition to davids point i think its we have an opportunity to sort of reset and we want to do that we believe thats appropriate regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful john and david thank you for taking my questions john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning just a little followup on that im still trying to understand the board approval which i assume you requested the size of the buyback that you requested because when i run that through the model im getting to an ultimate cet1 thats below the range that you indicated today so is that board request a function of the max potential that you might anticipate in an environment where the loan book is not growing or im just trying to square that the board request versus the cet1 guide versus the loan growth outlook david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so the main driver right now would be the cet1 guide the billion that we or that our board authorized grants us the flexibility to manage our capital as we see fit without having to go back to the board for another authorization so its going to be a function of how much we make whats the environment look like whats our capital levels look like there are whole host of things that go into that and that was the level that we felt comfortable that we could run with it and it gives us flexibility to manage accordingly thats all its about betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and whats the expiry date on that authorization david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah its an open theres not a date betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so its longer tailed okay and then the second question just has to do with esg and the reason im asking is that recently weve seen several institutions put out their plans and goals and we all know whats going on with regard to carbon footprint emission goals that the global industry has or politicians et cetera so the question here has to do with how youre thinking about your climate goals as it relates to your work with your customers youre in an energyintensive footprint and i know for yourself youve been very clear on your regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 climateoriented goals and how far along you are for yourself but im wondering how do you think about working with your customers on this is this something you would be embracing or give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i think about it from a couple different perspectives one is just managing the credit risk thats in our book today and the potential impact of climate change and transition on the industries that we bank were talking to our customers were very aware of potential impacts we understand the exposure we have within our portfolio and so were actively managing that we believe that its important that the banking industry be part of a transition and participate in financing the transition that will occur to a more climatefriendly environment and so we want to be actively participating we have a very good as an example solar capabilities and capital markets capabilities associated with solar and we are continuing to look for opportunities to develop capabilities that would support the transition to a more climatefriendly environment and so we think thats a business opportunity beyond that we have real governance good governance around and we spent the last two days in board meetings talking about esg and our overall esg plan we will file our tcfd report midsummer so that to be in compliance and i think youll find in our disclosures around esg to be very broad and on point so david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah betsy ill add to that so we started with our own emissions kind of in scope and then we went into the vendors that we used and how are they thinking about esg were going into customers and how they do that so this is an ongoing process that well stay committed to getting that done over time i do want to clarify that i misspoke on the share repurchase that runs through next year through the first quarter of next year so it is not open its basically a year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right yeah thats why i was a little bit like confused around the messaging you were trying to send with regard to the size of the buyback versus the cet1 range and i guess your messaging is hey we wanted max flexibility david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2021 operator your final question is from christopher marinac of j montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning just want to circle on the difference between your new loan yields and what was on balance sheet this quarter david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah our total loan our front book back book between securities and loans is about basis points from a loan standpoint i think that component is pretty close its maybe basis points basis points a little more on the securities book christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc david as you look at this type of environment what causes that to narrow or change in the future is it something thats possible or will it take a while david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp no it can change your mix the mix has a lot to do with it in terms of what youre putting on versus whats rolling off we have different portfolios weve invested in and we see growth in our small business through our newly acquired ascentium capital does have a tendency to have higher yields that could be helpful but we are seeing some of our customers access the capital markets and that puts a little pressure on loan growth and when those clients leave its tough to get that replaced at the yield that we had them on so as the economy opens we think we see more activity and we think the rate environment will improve a bit commensurate with that increased economic activity christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thats helpful thanks very much for all your comments john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you david j turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay well that concludes i think all the questionandanswer so thank you very much i appreciate your participation today and your
