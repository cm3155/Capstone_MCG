and loan growth supporting higher net interest margin with a stable asset quality for the third quarter western alliance generated record total net revenues of million net income of million and eps of

settlement services and other deposit initiatives to meaningfully contribute to growth and continue to enhance our funding profile in mortgage bankingrelated income declined million as the origination market continues to face major market disruption the speed and level to which rates have climbed have greatly reduced refinance activity and strained affordability in the purchase model servicing revenue was negatively impacted by a million msr hedge loss driven by volatility that spiked towards the back end of the quarter we have positioned amerihome to profitably operate in a lower origination market focused on becoming the industryleading lowcost operator and have implemented a strategy to prioritize profitability against volume market share finally asset quality continues to remain in great shape and we do not see issues on the horizon for the quarter wal recorded net loan recoveries of million or negative basis points and yeartodate we have remained net recovery position at this point dale will take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp for the third quarter western alliance generated net income of million eps and ppnr of million excluding a million marktomarket loss on preferred securities and million charge related to severance and other compensation charges primarily at amerihome

cecl total provision expense of million also captures our somewhat softer outlook on the economy total net revenue of million was an increase of million during the quarter and million or year overyear net interest income increased by from q2 to million which is driven by loan growth and further nim expansion overall noninterest income declined million to million from the prior quarter due to the lower mortgage bankingrelated income which fell million to million gain on sale revenue was million due to the lower purchase volumes while servicing fell to million as volatility rose which led to an msr hedge loss late in the quarter while the mortgage industry has made strides in rightsizing overcapacity to adjust to lower volumes in a higher rate environment this process is ongoing and normalized margins have not yet returned noninterest expense increased or million resulting an efficiency ratio of primarily due to higher deposit costs related to earnings credit if efficiency ratio was adjusted to reclassify deposit costs as interest expense it would be as remaining operating expenses were flat turning now to net interest drivers our growing assetsensitive balance sheet

creditlinked notes also climbed longterm debt expense increased million this quarter due to a million in total clns we have issued program todate which had preserved nearly million in equity capital

linkedquarter benefited from average interestearning asset growth of billion and nim expansion of basis points to interest income grew more quarteroverquarter than our total funding costs inclusive of ecr expenses as we remain asset sensitive our rate shock analysis shows with basis point rise over months and on a static balance sheet net interest income is expected to lift using the same scenario on a growth balance sheet we expect net interest income to grow over reviewing the effect of a 200basispoint shock on a growth balance sheet net interest income is expected to rise over over the months from the current run rate our efficacy ratio increased basis points to after reclassifying deposit costs as interest expense it improved from in the second quarter to in the third demonstrating the high operating leverage of the company deposit costs increased million from the prior quarter due to higher earnings credit rates on deposits of billion of which billion is in noninterestbearing dda preprovision net revenue rose to a record million during the quarter a increase from the same period last year and an increase of million or from the prior quarter this resulted in ppnr roa of a decline of basis points compared to last quarter whilst leading organic capital generation produces approximately basis points in cet1 capital on a static balance sheet per quarter and provides significant financial flexibility to fund balance sheet growth or build capital ratios balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased billion to billion and deposit growth of billion for our balances to billion at quarterend mortgage servicing rates balances increased million during the quarter to billion in part from declining prepayment fees total borrowings increased billion over the prior quarter to billion primarily due to an increase in short term borrowings to fund loan growth in excess of deposit expansion tangible book value per share increased or over the prior quarter to primarily due to strong organic earnings that offset unrealized marks on available for sale securities recorded in aoci tangible book value increased over the prior year this quarter we generated sound organic growth from our national business lines and regional banking divisions loans held for investment grew billion driven by billion in ci loans million in sponsorbacked commercial real estate and million in residential real estate ci growth was driven by million in tech and innovation million in warehouse lending and million in capital call lending of our loan growth this quarter came from our core very low to no loss national business lines turning to deposits we continue to experience growth across our diversified funding channels this quarter our regional banking divisions generated approximately of our net deposit growth while specialty deposit nbls drove the remainder in total deposits grew billion or annualized in the third quarter with noninterest bearing dda up billion cds million and savings and money market million noninterestbearing western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 ddas now comprise of our total deposit mix of which or billion have no associated earnings credit rate our diversified deposit franchises continue to provide ample opportunities to generate attractive funding to support loan growth with warehouse lending up billion regional banking divisions up million and business escrow services up million business escrow services has continued to establish new relationships with large corporate collaborators attorneys and private investment firms that support the growth ramp this quarter going forward we expect our scalable national deposit businesses such as hla settlement services and business escrow to continue to generate attractive deposits to fund ongoing balance sheet growth and temper the impact of elevated rates on our overall funding costs our asset quality remains stable and strong as classified and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets are still lower than prepandemic levels total classified assets increased million in q3 to million or basis points of total assets subsequent to quarterend approximately half of this increase in classified has been resolved and we see nothing to demonstrate the trend total nonperforming assets and total assets remained stable at basis points and then realized net recoveries of million special mention loans decreased million during the quarter to basis points of funded loans which represents a further decline from already historical lows last quarter if the prospects for additional economic volatility continue to evolve we believe our underwriting discipline borne out through our national business line strategies has prepared us for any credit stress that may accompany additional macro headwinds however we have not observed any preliminary signs of credit migration or client pressure we believe our safe and sound asset quality decisions will dictate our thoughtful and diversified loan growth trajectory and enable us to navigate through heightened economic uncertainty approximately of our loans are now in lowtonoloss categories and of the portfolio is credit protected through government guarantees cln first loss mortgage cash securities net recoveries were million basis points of average loan which balance to a net recovery position on a yeartodate basis our total loan acl increased million from the prior quarter to million is now greater than our pandemic high watermark that was set in yeartodate our acl has increased by million total loan acl to funded loans remained flat quarteroverquarter at basis points while our acl to nonperforming loans rose from in the prior quarter to this quarter adjusting for the billion of loans covered by creditlinked notes where ample first loss coverage is assumed by a third party the acl coverage ratio rises to basis points we believe these superior asset quality trends are sustainable throughout economic cycles due to western alliances deliberate postgfc business transformation strategy to become a national commercial bank focused on deep underwriting specialization and greater business diversification wals national reach and deep segment expertise enables selective relationships with the strongest counterparties on their most attractive projects with superior company risk management western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 during the global financial crisis of western alliances losses came from loan categories comprising of the loan portfolio which today makes up less than of total loans western alliance has spent the last decade working to minimize these risks and diversify the businesses we view a primary impediment to a higher stock valuation is misplaced concern about the credit risk heading into a likely recession cumulative net chargeoffs for the past decade have totaled only million against million in current reserves of our loan book is in lowtonoloss categories lastly the intended consequence of the creditlinked notes issuance has of the whole portfolio credit protected we knew of no other banks that can make this claim excellent asset quality has been a hallmark of the new wal rapid improvement drove ratios to the top quartile where they have essentially held even through the height of the pandemic classified and nonaccrual loans continue to hold below peers while chargeoffs have been minimal with the net recovery recognized yeartodate nonaccruals and net chargeoffs have consistently ranked as one among the best in the industry and classified loans in the top quartile even during the pandemic our credit risk mitigation expertise shined during and and will be critical if the economy weakens further a hallmark of wals business model is that greater diversification needs to sustain superior earnings growth with reduced volatility similar to a traditional sharpe ratio for stock returns our riskadjusted net income growth has been excellent relative to other large peers among the domestic publicly held publicly traded banks in the us with assets between billion and billion wal has produced the highest riskadjusted average net income growth while we werent the leader in earnings growth or the lowest in earnings volatility separately our combined strong and steady growth has produced the top riskadjusted return given our industryleading return on equity and assets we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic growth and maintain wellcapitalized regulatory ratios our tangible common equity to total assets of and common equity tier ratio of were both slightly lower than quarteroverquarter with aoci dynamics impacting tangible book value ratios across the industry we utilize our atm to strengthen capital in addition to our solid earnings we do not anticipate any share issuance will be needed if the cet1 builds throughout next year finally inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share increased or quarteroverquarter to which is slightly above our q1 level notably our tangible book value has grown annually since threeandahalf times the rate of the peer group i will now hand the call back to ken for closing comments kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale i was pleased with the management teams ability to adapt to the changing interest rate and economic environments to produce record operating results thoughtful balance sheet growth in conjunction with operating and executional focus positioned the bank to capitalize on net interest income sensitivity while simultaneously growing both sides of the balance sheet with industryleading performance western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 our superior operating leverage offset the decline in mortgage banking income asset quality remained stable and solid and no signs of elevated stress organic earnings should grow capital as we reposition the company for slower growth ahead of a potential slowdown so let me tell you what you can expect going forward here given the uncertain future economic and operating environment we believe its prudent to prioritize more measured but still double digit loan growth targeting up to billion per quarter we plan to surgically reduce loan growth through increased pricing and tighter credit criteria while deemphasizing loan growth not accompanied by high quality deposits deposits are expected to grow at approximately billion a quarter this will lower our loan to deposit ratio over time which currently stands at our goal over the next year is to bolster key capital ratios back to pre amerihome levels including cet1 our bank industry leading return on average tangible common equity produced a significant organic capital of approximately basis points of cet1 net of dividends per quarter which provides us with significant flexibility to grow capital ratios and fund the balance sheet growth we expect to achieve our cet target by mid2023 aided by restrained balance sheet growth and risk weighted asset optimization programs net interest margin is expected to continue to expand in q4 at a similar pace to q3 given the anticipated rising rate environment we expect continued quarterly expansion of nim and growth in net interest income throughout even after the fed pauses rate increases as fixed rate securities and loans reprice and balance sheet growth continues total revenue should continue to climb due to strong net interest income with a drag from mortgage banking likely to moderate assuming muted volatility our expense ratio excluding the impact of deposit costs should remain in the low given inherent operating leverage of our business asset quality remains wellpositioned and ranks among the industrys best the technical recession we believe we have entered may move some key ratios slightly higher but we do not anticipate any material deterioration that would change our above peers standing in conclusion we continue to see an eps of for as a launching pad from which eps can ascend at this time were happy to take your questions and i should have also said that tim bruckner our chief credit officer is with us here today as well western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question is from casey haire from jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i was hoping to get some color on the comments about nim expanding through next year obviously it sounds like youre going to be a little bit more selective on the loan growth front which could help on the yield side but it does obviously seem a little bit tougher on the deposit betas and the funding pressure there so what kind of and i know you guys dont manage to deposit betas but what kind of deposit beta is in your forecast that is still allowing you to just drive nim expansion through next year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay so well tag team this let me start off and then ill throw it over to dale i just want to make sure were clear that for q4 and through we are projecting a growing and vibrant net interest income using the consensus fomc forecast so net interest income and nim will continue to grow into even after the fomc concludes raising rates and we feel comfortable with this forecast for several reasons number one the increase or excess liquidity that were going to get from having deposits grow faster than loan growth would drive federal home loan bank borrowings downward lowering funding costs second current and future loan growth is being priced at a higher levels as weve seen liquidity withdrawn from the banking system the third item is billion of loans repriced every quarter so it was about rolling over at higher spreads and our fixed rate securities and loans totaling million also reprice quarterly which we see we think we can get some benefit from the other thing i would say is since my return to the company taking over as ceo we focused on net interest income rather than net interest margin rate and then focusing on net interest income allows us to also produce the eps results that we have achieved and so in our mind what we have done is going forward we have priced a deposit beta with a loan beta and we kind of see the spreads which have been materially increasing for us certainly since the beginning of q3 but even before that to carry us for the rest of the year dale do you want to add anything to that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp sure casey we have lower levels of interestbearing deposits and other funding sources borrowings and clns and we do in terms of interest asset earning loans and securities and thats primarily because of our dda that has no ecr i mentioned that is billion and so were okay bringing on high beta funding as long as its going into a beta assets and were going to continue to see that i think some of the other institutions have been challenged because theyve actually held back on their deposit raising those costs of their consumers or something else and they believe that its going to withstand that and then theyve been surprised and so now they have betas in excess of at least for some accounts we havent been there we know what our funding looks like we havent realized that we can kind of sneak things by and so we have been our pricing is right there in terms of where it needs to be and what were seeing in terms of our spot rates kind of confirms this so for example on our loan yields our spot rate at the end of the second quarter was at the end of the third quarter it was up basis points meanwhile for our funding costs our deposits liabilities and cost was up from to so up basis points and again what we had during the second and third quarter is we had loan yields tempered because that we were forced were still active thats not the case anymore and so we see that picking up and then were going to have more dollars rolling over in terms of maturities and right now those fixed rate loans are about basis points below the current operate that we would do today that is going to reprice more than what were going to see on liabilities because liability repricing for us hasnt lacked kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey casey im going to give you a quick story i think that everyone on the phone will like and then im going to ask you for a pop quiz here okay we turned down loans in our senior loan committee those were loans million or greater not because of credit we like the credit a great deal but we turned them down because of pricing and their initial price wasnt a high enough or the step downs were coming down too quickly or we didnt like the floors and we decided to move the floors up and so heres your pop quiz how did we do against loans we went back to the borrowers and asked them if they would accept the higher pricing level casey haire q analyst jefferies llc not very well kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp wrong we want for for right casey haire q analyst jefferies llc indiscernible higher price kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 people came back and said yes to the higher price youre right and that told us a few things one it makes us almost feel like you put your house on the market on day one and you sell it first thing you say is oh my god i sold it too cheaply so what we really determined from that and that was over a couple of weeks period when we went back and looked at the loans but what weve really determined was liquidity is leaving the system right and one of the things thats natural for us and whats different for our bank versus others is that we try to be a bank for all seasons and we try to remain open for all seasons now that may mean that we tightened credit criteria which we have it may mean that we ask for more equity in the deals which we have and it may mean that were asking for higher pricing but we remain open and one of reasons you see the volume the loan volume continue to come in above what our previous guide has been is because weve developed this loyalty and people come to us because they know they can get a deal done and the incremental shortterm costs or higher cost of funding doesnt compare to the longer term value that theyre getting so i just wanted to you asked a simple question and we decided to give you a long answer casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah no appreciate it okay just on the cet1 target by midyear so is there anything that youre going to do that organically right just moderating the loan growth or is there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah casey haire q analyst jefferies llc and without the atm is there any like bond book run off is that part of it or anything else that help you get there on that in short order kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well there are two things that were doing certainly just repositioning our loan growth to up to billion is going to help us probably grow net to basis points per quarter we generally do basis points of organic growth subtract out for the billion and thats how you get to or so basis points quarterbyquarter the other thing is tim bruckner is sitting here with us but he has led this reoptimization or optimization of our risk weighted assets specifically around unfunded commitments and we expect that to grow as well there may be a cln note that youll see a deal happen in maybe this quarter or maybe in quarters one or two and its the combination of those things and a bunch of other smaller activities that i just dont think are worthwhile going through at this time that drive us to a level q2 we think latest q3 and its all without you asked a very specific question its all without hitting the atm casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good thanks ill step back thanks guys western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 operator your next question comes from ethan sic ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey its ibrahim here i guess just maybe going back to comments around billion plus in deposit growth put some perspective around your comfort around there obviously there is a lot of concern around the industry around deposit pricing deposit growth so like your conviction level in meeting those deposit growth numbers and then how should we think about its impact on deposit costs and mix shift as we think through kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp were going to split this one up and tag team it as well ill take the volume side dale will take the cost side and so if i heard you clearly enough and correct me if im wrong that you really want to know what gives us the confidence around the billion right well weve been running that and then some on that if you go back looking at our history while we have got several deposit franchises that are very strong we have our hla business okay thats strong settlement services is something we started to build in we rolled out in it now has billion of deposits and so going back a couple of years when everyone when i say everyone other banks said gee we dont want any more deposits we always said no deposit franchises will really determine what our market capitalization will be in the future and how well we perform so we rolled out settlement services we rolled out business escrow services we also have a tech business that produces of deposits for every in loans warehouse lending has also been a very strong provider of deposit growth and i want to bring you back to amerihome for a moment this is very important when we bought amerihome we said we bought it because we saw an emerging regional bank in the seven quarters that weve owned amerihome weve taken amerihomes deposits from a standing start of to billion billion in seven quarters right i wouldnt tell you not to extrapolate that going forward but it goes to show you that billion really sat it really sits on the bank side of the company and has been generating that incremental interest income from us so those are the growth channels do you want to take the cost side dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so on the cost side of that ill note we talked about that weve brought in million of deposits from business escrow services well million of that is in nonecr dda so that should help us on the cost side and were getting traction there i got to tell you weve got an application pending with the occ to commence a corporate trust operation we think that that is likely to kick off this particular time we hired a team from wells fargo after they sold their operation and we think thats going to be a source of funding for us also kind of going forward and then in terms of your deposits so again were there that were not trying to necessarily wrestle that everything has to come in and super cheap standard rates or not market rates but we have the ability and weve western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 demonstrated this to bring in funds consistently i would say our pipelines going forward are at least as good as what theyve been the past couple of quarters and it has been a little harder than we thought we did exceed loan growth versus deposit growth were right sizing that from q4 forward kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp let me just tie it back to a question that casey asked us as well and tie it back to net interest income if you dont have loan growth its harder to bring in deposit growth because that deposit growth is coming in at a very high incremental cost to it we have the ability to grow loans in excess of billion and youve seen that right and so the fact that we can match off deposit growth at a marginal rate compared with a beta to it compared to beta on the loan side allows us to make the spread and as weve said weve increased those spreads so thats what kind of gives us the benefits and again ill point you right back to and i dont think we get enough credit for this and im going to start harping on it that our business model is different than almost every other banks business model and this is what our model allows us to do ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it as far as theres no pop indiscernible im fine with that and i guess just another followup question dale you talked about credit costs when you look at the acl basis points what should that what is that embedding in terms of the macro understanding your portfolio is very different if the economy is headed into a recession where do you see that reserve ratio building because thats the other piece of downside eps risk as we think about the next few quarters dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we use the moodys model like i think most do we take weights the preponderance is on the kind of consensus and then we have a much heavier weight on s4 versus s1 and so as those numbers have become kind of more impaired as they did in third quarter over second it did pull up a little bit more in terms of what an appropriate acl would be i would say were not expecting chargeoffs to occur and as long as we are right side up on ltvs and were a low ltv lender across the board our residential book was underwritten at and it is now probably under in terms of ltv our commercial real estate is on anywhere from to about and so we feel strongly that and the moodys model show this that unless theres something really severe happening were going to be able to do well on that id like to point back to the pandemic we saw the hotel book and hotels clearly took a direct hit from travel during and and people were throwing numbers back at me in terms of what were looking at in terms of losses we didnt lose a dime in hotels the entire time its because weve had good sponsorship low loan to value and were and the type of loans were doing we werent doing central business big boxes where people werent coming anymore and that have very little cost structures in terms of not a lot of flexibility these are like select service deals like a residents in and the hotel they close every other floor to hold their costs down and that worked and it worked for us western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just making sure i heard you correctly i think you mentioned full year eps implies about to exit eps run rate for fourth quarter do you believe you can grow earnings off of that in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp im sorry we cant hear you clearly dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah if i heard you correctly ibrahim i mean yes we think that the is period from that we can thats the support quarter number and implicitly obviously and that from there given what we expect to happen in terms of a continued loan growth a little bit more tempered than maybe what the street has had us at but margin expansion which is the opposite of what the street has had us at now we can continue to sustain that throughout again this is the backdrop of what the fomc actions are going to be as predicted in the futures curve ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood thanks for taking my questions dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp youre welcome operator your next question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody but i wanted to start with the deposit costs side if i include the cost kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp steve you got to talk up well steve we cant really hear you can you pick up the receiver or get closer to the phone were just not hearing you clearly steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc is that any better western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp much better steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay on the deposit cost side if i include the cost of the earnings creditrelated deposits and the cost of total we calculate these change by about basis points quarteroverquarter earning assets are up basis points so from a spread view its up about basis points looking at it through that lens how do you see that spread trending over the next few quarters dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp probably most likely parallel i mean i think we have a little bit indiscernible in the loan side because of kind of they were held back but because of floors but yes were comfortable with the parallel shift there and also were getting better pricing on the loan side and i dont think that we there is much more to go on funding cost increases steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay on the ecr deposits how much of the billion per quarter growth do you assume will come from that and how should we think about that cost moving forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp were not expecting that our deposit structure on the liability side is going to be improving at all and so what weve dialed in is growth predominantly in either interestbearing or in ecrrelated i do think that weve got opportunities to bring some other stuff in as i mentioned with business escrow services and some of these others but that is not a major factor in terms of moving that needle i think were going to be paying for deposits steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then finally in terms of pulling back the lending a bit which categories are you planning to de emphasize here thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah good question steve and so as ive said weve tried to do this in a very surgical way so were going to pull back our resi loan growth this quarter it was million i would expect that to drop to under million in q4 and then drop to under million going forward but just to refresh the memory for those on the phone it wasnt too long ago that we had billion sitting in liquidity at basis points and so building up a residential book seemed to be the appropriate thing to do back then were not going to be emphasizing it now going forward the other places youll see us be more circumspect on is in the capital call subscription line space we really havent seen the crosslending portfolio company opportunities that we hope to have materialized but they did western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 not and so were going to pull back there that business eats up a lot of our unfunded lines our unfunded commitments thats why tim bruckner is working on that in terms of the optimization and i guess i would say the other thing is we continue to stay close to all our clients and no loan gets approved certainly at the most senior level in this company without a significant deposit relationship coming over and weve made that a big focus as well and therefore if youre not bringing over deposits then some of our loan growth will slow naturally but quite frankly as a entrepreneurial bank that has always outperformed on the loan growth side this is a challenge for us to a certain extent to be more surgical on where were going to grow and now we think can do that and we think we could keep the loan growth to under billion and that kind of connects back to the cet1 ratio and why were trying to also move it up to were not getting credit for the loan growth steve and people are saying well youre probably lending into a recession we just will pull back and well look for higher yields on all that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good afternoon brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co ken i think i heard you mention that you thought the efficiency ratio would stay in the low sort of the impact of ecr deposit costs i want to make sure i heard that correctly so there were some severance small severance costs in the quarter and wondering if what the benefit from those might be going forward and then finally because youre pulling back on growth does that mean we should maybe think about pulling back on the expense growth as well im just trying to get a sense of kind of the expenses execr kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so you did hear me correctly that exdeposit costs the efficiency ratio should stay in the low brad if we dont keep it there i mean look we could take it down but were not going to do that for several reasons and i think ive been clear about this on previous calls number one were preparing for the day that we grow over the million threshold and we always need to continue to invest at risk management and technology which were doing western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 we also are continuing to invest in new products and new services new rollouts and dale mentioned one we actually got a little ahead of what i was going to say about that on the corporate trust i was going to wait until we brought in some deposits but weve built that into our expense base next year as well which is a new product or a new business line so its important for us to continue to build up these new business lines and thats why were going to keep it in the low that will help us or that will not deter our growth in total eps as we roll into there were a couple of components to your question did i answer all of them brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co yeah i think so and maybe as my followup question to dale just on the ecr deposits again do you see a change in the pace of that beta or that rate in which those costs are going up do you see that accelerating i am sure its not decelerating but just kind of curious your thought around just kind of the pace of that change going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i dont i mean i think out of the gate we had some that were a little more sluggish than others but this has been the most widely telegraphed rate rise scenario i think in history and no one is not aware of it not western alliance anyway and so yeah so were they are fully participating theyre basically moving in lockstep with fomc or effective fed funds brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks brad operator your next question comes from timur braziler from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe looking at the msr hedge loss this quarter can you just help us kind of frame our thoughts around that is that kind of going to continue in the fourth quarter just given the pace of rates is that a little bit more idiosyncratic with just the shift in volume and any color on kind of broader direction for amerihome and a gain on sale revenue would be greatly appreciated western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah let me give you the broader direction and tell you what we are planning for in so we are using the q3 total mortgage servicing revenues of million as our base going forward throughout we hope to do much better than that but for our planning purposes million is the base as we go forward so thats i think the first thing regarding the million indiscernible that we had our models when we model things we model out the life of loan for years all the cash flows and then we discount it back and we hedge that in our model but we hedge it out to months after that theres not enough liquidity in some of the hedging instruments and so we took a little bit of a hit in the volatility going out above months now what i should say and we should have said in the opening statements here we pulled back half of that in the msr valuations we have outside firms look at the msr valuations and so while we took the million indiscernible back about million of that so the net impact was million but were also doing something different in the business we continue to right size that business were probably down about in total people count there so were trying to make sure we are the low cost operator in that space and were not trying to win share for share purposes only were trying to win profitable share so the volume indiscernible we purchased will be less but we are pushing and hopefully the market will see this and also follow that the margins will increase and so far early results in the early q4 is that strategy is beginning to work timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color i appreciate that thank you and then maybe just going back to one of dales comments on talking on asset quality you mentioned that the provision is going to capture a softer view of the economy i know youre pulling back on some lending verticals but that doesnt seem creditrelated i guess as you look out across your landscape what are those softer areas that youre kind of focusing on here dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp you mean softer indiscernible more opportunistic areas actually ill let tim answer this indiscernible we signaled that we saw some headwinds in the economy where have we pulled back or where have we responded is that correct timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes thats right timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp right so okay great so a year ago we started adding a real heavy stress to everything development constructionrelated and commercial real estate okay so thats one so we had tempered our underwriting weve maintained that weve become more conservative in advance and underwritten with a significantly heavier interest rate stress i think thats positioned us well in that segment western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 on the investor dependent side starting in november october and november of last year we significantly stressed our enterprise valuation methodology so those two areas are areas that given our portfolio weighting would receive more stress and we adjusted early kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah were also breaking our portfolio down we did this coming out of last year into four major categories the insurable portfolio which dale referenced which is about of our portfolio is a credit protected insured or have a government guarantee to it we have economicresilient economicresistant and then we have economic sensitive and weve been deemphasizing the economicsensitive loan categories and staying with the other three actually basically the insurable category and the economicresistant categories and were going to be spending more of our time in terms of our lending pursuits timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then just as a followup you guys have certainly outpaced the market when it comes to warehouse lending and i know a good component of that is just kind of tapping into the amerihome network i guess how big of an opportunity is left there and maybe just broader thoughts around warehouse would be appreciated kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so when we say warehouse lending weve got a couple of components to that one is the traditional warehouse lending but also indiscernible warehouse funding is our note financing opportunity thats noteonnote financing where well see ltvs of about maybe or lower and well be in a first position the note financing business is really very strong at this point and so it is helping lift the warehouse lending side a little bit but to be honest with you were still seeing a lot of good growth coming in warehouse lending and there i would say that were taking some market share as well as people are pulling back and as other people are struggling to deliver the type of service we deliver were also seeing msr lending is embedded in that group too and that has a lot of interest from borrowers and we have some comfort level that we can grow that throughout timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the color i appreciate it operator your next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey great thanks dale i want to go back to the loan and deposit repricing if i could moving a little slow today can you just repeat kind of the comments about incremental betas on both sides of the balance sheet im just trying to make sure i get what the messaging is on repricing of assets and liabilities dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 so if i look at our spot rates we have a greater momentum coming from q2 and q3 that isnt captured in the average rates on the loan side more significantly than it is on the funding side and i think thats because in part the loans were held back because of floors that and nothing is close to a floor today and so i think that carries us in terms of what that looks like going forward and so as long as we have a loan beta from here that is no lower than the deposit beta and were anticipating deposit betas to be very high were going to continue to do well and especially if we can reprice things higher as ken mentioned with these returns that we had from our senior loan committee all of which came back with yeah well take the underwriting even at a higher cost so we think were wellsituated to secure that now through the fourth quarter i mean i think were dialing in basis points and then basis points and then we dont have anything in i think maybe theres going to be a little bit of a tail but with that kind of a profile and with really the repricing were doing on our loan book that isnt i dont see that in our funding book because our funding book is already really fully moving in lockstep now we do have some benefit opportunities like we had in where million of our dda was not ecrrelated i think some of those things are going to kick in but we dont have to do that so as long as we all we have to do is to have our loan betas be no lower than our deposit betas the loan book and with the securities book which is demonstrating variable rate as well largely were going to be able to continue to have expansion of net interest margin and then couple that with a more modest expansion of the balance sheet christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah you said very high deposit rate did you put a number on that for kind of future betas dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i did no no i mean look its really as ken mentioned thats not our management thing we are not trying to optimize betas we are trying to optimize net interest income and ppnr christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay last one just to make sure i understand the that you reiterated is that just remind me is that full year net income earnings per share or is that fourth quarter annualized kind of get the right starting off point dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah thats the full year of kind of what an operating income would be correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yes western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 operator your next question comes from andrew terrell from stephens inc please go ahead andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning most of mine have been asked and addressed already but dale can you remind us just expectation for the size of the average loans held for sale portfolio and then do you have a spot rate on that book at the end of the quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah the spot rate on that book was and we think that balance is going to be modestly lower than where we ended at andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay perfect thank you operator your next question comes from brandon king from truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey just one question for me i mean i understand and i see these benefits when rates are rising but im curious what are the actions youve taken in the event that we have a recession and theoretically rates will fall just curious if there have been any actions that youve taken in place to kind of protect against that for the future dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so one thing really helped us during the pandemic is we are active and basically mandate and do you think that this is a syndicated situation led by somebody else and we get indiscernible and so we did that and that held up our loan yields much better than some others and it kind of improved our net interest income were still doing that today theyre really i would say largely ineffective at this point in time because you put a floor in maybe that floor is a basis points lower than the current rate based upon the variable rate instrument there and then if it goes up another basis points in the next days its just going to be way out of the money but if we hold at higher rates for say like a year well be able to reprice a lot of those floors much closer to the current rate which will give us a lot of insulation in terms of what that would be like the other thing i would say is when gosh i mean in a lower rate environment i think the mortgage market is going to get jumpstarted and were certainly ready for that also brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and no other i guess hedges or interest rate collars being put on the balance sheet has that been contemplated as well western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we always debate that and we put some term kind of hedges on and we some fixed swaps back when rates were in low couple of digit basis points so well evaluate that at that time but again thats just to mitigate kind of the downturn brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions operator your next question is from jon armstrong from rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks how are you guys doing kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good good just a few cleanup questions one on chris mcgrattys question on the run rate deal i know its kind of nitpicky but if you take the annualized you get to for the fourth quarter i think youre saying thats too low but we kind of have to stretch to get to just clarifying that for us on the number what do you mean by that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so the is the full year operating eps so you have to be above maybe i misunderstood chris question a little bit you have to be above that thats going to take you to kind of the range or somewhere in there to be able to do that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah for the fourth quarter and youre saying thats the jumping in off point for dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 yeah okay ive had a couple of questions i think people know im the last guy on the call maybe but can you talk about the ecr expenses and talk about the efficiency ratio with ecr and how you want us to think about that expense in the model dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well so were showing it both ways i mean to me if it looks act and smells like something maybe thats what you should call it i think it really acts like interest expense thats not really how the gap maps it geographically so here we are jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so we look at both ways i do think that taking it out and considering it as interest expense gives one a much better view in terms of one is the bank assetsensitive or not how indiscernible rising and interest income relative to expense and were still higher not as much higher as if we keep it in expense and then and then you look at your operating kind of architecture and were in the low if you just eliminate it completely and i think those are kind of both appropriate as ken said i think our efficiency ratio going forward roughly the same position of the low is appropriate and again were looking for continued improvement on net interest income growth relative to interest expense including deposit costs indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp jon ill add only one thing to that is youll see deposit cost rise in q4 again near maybe the same level as q3 but as we begin to enter into that rise will be tempered and it wont be as noticeable as we go through based on the fomc projected rate increases jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay i just have two more for ken just kind of on that topic when do you think the margin starts to top out kind of when or where because i look back in my models and i know your business is a little different but you are approaching the high in the last hiking cycle and im just curious if thats just out of the question and just the timing on when you think this all might peak kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so again everything is predicated at least right now for us on what the fomc is going to do which for us is bps in a couple of weeks followed by bps thats in our that help in our forecast we actually dont have anything in there at all any upward actions in but we see in terms of the nim the rate we see that continuing to rise quartertoquarter it may flatten a little bit out towards the very end of the year but right now we western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 even still have that kind of rising as a nice slope throughout the year in excess of what we see in consensus but certainly lower than the historical highs that you alluded to jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah got you all right and then the last one i have i like what you guys are doing but i have to ask this when you go for on the higher pricing i mean i understand thats a positive but you could take it the other way as well it could cause you the question pricing and the competitive environment as well but what is that what do you really learn from that the for what does that say about the competitive environment and maybe what did you learn from that thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thanks jon on the competitive side its telling us that other banks other competitors have pulled back probably for several reasons first and foremost we think its because they dont have that deposit base that we have or that fresh liquidity coming into their bank number one number two they may be more regionalized in their lending or they may be just more product niche focused we have the ability to deploy liquidity and capital to at least different national business lines that we have inside the bank so it gives us an opportunity to really flex our business models and capability the third may be different perception on the economy now we are expecting a recession and we are modeling that and we are doing our underwriting as if a recession is going to occur and of course we stress test everything for a much higher rates and lower vacancies and lower rents and all the other things you would expect us to do but we feel comfortable with our underwriting and the quality of borrower that were getting in and the reason why i think we feel comfortable one of the reasons is back to being a bank for all seasons we remain open and as i said this to every clients well always remain open to try to help you but given the economic either uncertainty or environment were going to just change around credit criteria equity that were going to require in a deal and pricing but you should be able to get a loan from us assuming that the deal pencils out and then were dealing with a good borrower and indiscernible a little bit about higher interest rates they come back and pay them because they realize the shortterm cost of that interest rate is nothing compared to the longer term benefits theyre going to get and so this comes back to the service side dependability the ability to close when we say were going to close we close and once we shake hands we dont retreat and that has a lot of positive force to having our clients continue to return to us dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp and we dont provide a commodity service i mean so even in normal times our pricing is almost always higher than others but because of what ken said in terms of our ability to kind of to deliver on time and in this consistent structure as promised thats where something to our clients and they are willing to pay for it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thanks jon operator there are no further questions at this time please proceed kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thank you all for attending the call
