afternoon to those of you in hong kong im joining you today from london and have alongside me noel and georges ill be making some short opening remarks before handing over to noel as you may have already seen we have announced today that noel has informed the board of his intention to retire from the bank after nearly five years in the role the board and i would like to pay tribute to noels exceptional leadership during this time as group chief executive he drove both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler more focused business through the disposal of assets in the us france and canada this has enabled us to deliver an improved performance achieving record profit last year and create a platform for future growth and development noel who you will hear from in a second has decided its the right time to step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 as you would expect the board keeps succession planning under constant review we already have started a robust and rigorous process to find our next group chief executive this process will look at both internal and external candidates im very pleased that noel has agreed to remain in his role while this process takes place ensuring a smooth and orderly transition and on a personal note id like to thank noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to hsbc which he joined years ago noel its been a pleasure and privilege to work with and alongside you noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you mark thank you im very grateful for your support guidance friendship and partnership im proud of what my hsbc colleagues and i have achieved together over the past five years over that period we have hit some significant milestones record profits last year the strongest returns in a decade and the highest dividend since as mark mentioned we have created a more focused business and i believe we have built a strong platform for the banks next phase of development and growth thats why i feel this is the right time to step back to find a better balance between my personal and business commitments with the intention going forward after a break of pursuing a portfolio career when i reflect back on the last years i have held intensive leadership roles particularly since i took over the uk commercial bank in october of after years of intensive leadership im ready for a change but its also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes to the end of the current transformation phase its an ideal time to bring in new leadership the board has now started a process to find my successor and im very happy to continue in my role as that process takes place rest assured i will be working hard to ensure a smooth and orderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business as you have seen in q1 until then its business as usual so lets now turn to our q1 results which have showed continued progress we had a good first quarter reported profit before tax was billion excluding notable items profit before tax was billion our return on tangible equity was excluding notable items im also pleased with the further capital distributions of billion which brings the total amounts of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last months to almost billion and we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance for i will now hand over to georges to take you through the numbers georges elhedery group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel id like to open by paying tribute to the enormous contribution noel has made to the bank ive greatly enjoyed working alongside him and i know everyone at the bank has appreciated his strong and effective leadership im also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since my appointment as cfo month ago the board has announced a process to find a successor and i know noel and i will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until that process has been completed hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 turning now to the numbers reported profit before tax of billion was down billion on the first quarter of on a constant currency basis excluding notable items profit before tax was billion down billion on last years first quarter on an annualized basis we delivered a return on tangible equity of or excluding notable items we completed the billion share buyback announced in february in two month this means that since the end of we have bought back of our outstanding shares and the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues this quarter we have announced as noel said a further billion of distributions consisting of first interim dividend for of per share the special dividend of per share from the canada sale proceeds and a new share buyback of up to billion which we plan to begin right after the agm and complete within three month finally we are reconfirming all of our guidance including a midteens return on tangible equity excluding notable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around on a target basis so on the next slide reported profit before tax of billion included billion gain on the sale of canada partly offset by the billion impairment on the classification of argentina as held for sale excluding notable items profit before tax was billion with revenue growth offset primarily by higher costs and ecls revenue of billion was up billion on the first quarter of last year excluding notable items revenue was billion which was up billion on the first quarter of last year with growth in banking nii partly offset by lower fee and other income within that we saw highsingledigit growth in multijurisdictional revenue in the first quarter which underlines the value of our global network banking nii of billion was up billion on the fourth quarter on a reported fx basis mainly driven by argentina banking nii as well as the nonrecurrence of the cash flow hedge reclassification in the last quarter looking ahead to the rest of the year a few things to keep in mind first our q1 banking nii included billion from canada which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion of the sale in march this year second first quarter banking nii also included billion from argentina this contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed which we expect to be within the next months please therefore do not extrapolate the billion run rate for the remainder of the year our banking nii guidance assumes a contribution of around billion in fullyear for argentina which is in line with fullyear third the banking nii outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our fullyear results in february the hong kong time deposit mix remains stable as a percentage of customer deposits in the quarter and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates however it is still early in the year and these things can change so we are maintaining our banking nii guidance of at least billion turning to fee and other income wholesale transaction banking was down by primarily due to the normalization of fx revenues compared to a very strong foreign exchange performance in the first quarter of last year which benefited from higher market volatility fees from global payment solutions had another good quarter up by wealth is another growth area that had a very good quarter up by on the same period last year as our investment continued to drive improved results private banking was a standout performer mainly driven by increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in asia but growth in wealth has been broad based hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 to illustrate this we acquired around newtobank retail wealth customers in hong kong in the quarter approximately of these were nonresidents attracted by our service and product capabilities in hong kong building on previous quarters we attracted billion of net new invested assets of which billion were in asia and our insurance new business csm was billion up from billion in the first quarter of last year on credit expected credit losses were billion in the quarter equivalent to basis points of average loans these were primarily stage charges across retail and wholesale there was a million charge related to our mainland china commercial real estate portfolio while challenges remain within the sector we expect a more benign ecl contribution from it than last year we remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue monitoring developments closely and we are reconfirming our ecl guidance of around basis points of average loans recognizing the overall uncertainty from the flowthrough effect of high rates on the economy next were on track to meet our target of limiting cost growth to around on a target basis this quarters yearonyear cost growth was impacted by three items first we chose to face the accrual of our performance related pay more evenly this year than we did last year this accounted for percentage points of cost growth this quarter we do not currently expect the total amount of performancerelated pay for to be significantly different to so the accrual will be lower over the next three quarters than it was in the same period last year second hsbc innovation banking contributed to percentage point of cost growth this quarter as we only acquired svb uk in the middle of march last year we intend to provide you with a fuller update on that business at the half year but im pleased that it has good momentum in the uk we onboarded new to bank innovation banking client groups in the quarter the best quarter since acquisition finally another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the bank of england levy and the incremental fdic special assessment we remain committed to cost discipline and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting cost growth to circa on a target basis inclusive of all the above items on lending and deposits there was good loan growth in the uk the middle east mexico and asia excluding hong kong loan demand in hong kong remained subdued largely due to the high interest rate differential with mainland china overall we continue to expect midsingledigit loan growth over the medium to long term but we expect demand to remain subdued in the near term deposits were down this was due to a range of factors including seasonality the switch from time deposits to wealth products in hong kong and our deliberate choice to forsake some highly pricesensitive deposits next our cet1 ratio was up basis point on the fourth quarter organic capital generation and the gain from the sale of the canadian business enabled us to announce billion of capital distributions this quarter this includes a share buyback of up to billion which is expected to have an impact of around basis points on our cet1 ratio in the second quarter for modeling purposes please note that the billion of dividends announced today as well as the billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full year results in february will both be reflected in tnav in the second quarter at closing of the sale of hsbc argentina which is expected within month we will also recognize billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses subject to any movement in this reserve up until completion these losses have already been accumulated in capital over the previous years therefore recognition in the pl will have no impact on cet1 nor on tnav hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 finally looking forward to the rest of the year our good first quarter puts us on track and we are reconfirming all of our guidance a midteens return on tangible equity excluding notable items banking nii of at least billion ecls of around basis points cost growth limited to around on a target basis and a dividend payout ratio and with that louise can we please go to qa question and answer section operator thank you george operator instructions our first question today comes from joseph dickerson at jefferies please accept the prompt to unmute your line joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi good morning thank you for taking my questions and congrats noel on a great tenure at the bank and well done to the roe and the capital return i guess just in terms of my question the td migration in hong kong if you go back to the way you were computing it previously actually looks like it improved quarteronquarter and certainly under the new definition has stabilized i think its slide if im not mistaken in the presentation is that a little bit better than where your expectations were a few months ago i know when i was in hong kong recently it sounded like things were starting to stabilize but is that better than where you were thinking a few months ago and then secondly on the buybacks is the billion number due more to the calendar effect or is that kind of a are you looking to kind of boost the run rate there from the billion in the quarter thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you joseph so first on the time deposit reclassification we have actually reclassified some private bank term deposits to time deposits this is due to the observation of their behavior and the recognition that they better classify these time deposits this rebases the number but as you could see from the two charts we have it does not affect the trend so therefore the trend that weve seen under both classifications is the same and weve seen the first quarter stable quarteronquarter its too early to call it a peak but weve always expected migration this year to be slower than what weve seen last year and this just confirms the trend change from what weve seen in fullyear as regards your buyback question so the short answer is yes this is indeed due to calendar effects we just completed a billion buyback in two month thats about billion a month that is the fastest run rate we have done in terms of share buybacks ever we are now announcing a billion buyback which we intend to do over the next three month starting after agm we will see how the run rate goes with the it will remain at a billion run rate we will see how it will go hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 as regards any future amount of buyback or whether we are doing a buyback one it remains our intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share buyback and second we will decide on a quarterbyquarter basis based on our capital outlook the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd okay thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you joseph next question please operator operator instructions our next question today comes from raul sinha at jpmorgan please accept the prompt to unmute your line raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc hi morning everybody thanks very much for taking my questions maybe two from me as well just doing george on this point on distributions and looking at the sort of moving parts for capital one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in rwas i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the growth in rwas is billion of increase driven by asset quality trends i think youve calling out its predominantly in asia what should we think about the sort of outlook for rwa growth from here even if loan growth is muted just to get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in quantum terms for distributions and i guess the second question to noel just maybe a question for your broader thoughts noel the five years preceding have been pretty extraordinary not just for hsbc but i guess for a lot of people in your markets given the pandemic but when we look at where hsbc is now youve exited canada you announced argentina youre in the process of exiting quite a few smaller markets the return on tangible equity is already in the midteens youre buying back stock at billion a quarter youve got a special dividend as well i guess what im really interested in is from here onwards what do you think is left to do for the group to kind of progress thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you raul ill start with your first question raul first on so on rwa outlook so of the rwa growth we called on a quarteronquarter basis of billion first about of it relate to lending and other asset growth and as you can see from our lending book weve grown our lending book by billion theres a number of areas of growth that contributed to around of it billion then weve had a billion market risk rwa growth this is due to a pickup in mss activity against a subdued and its more in line with their activity levels the first three quarters of the year if you want and this is the normalization of the markets activity hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 and then there is billion which we classified broadly as asset quality now asset quality first it is a continuous exercise we do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis we have recognized across a number of geographies and a number of sectors certain names which weve decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash flows has been more severe you will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ecl and thats mainly because for many of these customers their balance sheet remains strong so were comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore there is no ecl implication from this downgrade but just closing the loop this rwa downgrade you will see some of it materialize in our stage loans where we increased our stage loans by about billion and thats exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality with regards how we look forward we are very comfortable where we are today our credit metrics remain solid as i say the balance sheet of our customers remain strong for a number of them for at least the exposure that is collateralized were very comfortable with the level of collateralization and the ltv and therefore we do not foresee at this stage today any additional action we should be taking we will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always do noel noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc raul and thank you it has certainly been an extraordinary five years as you say not just for hsbc but for the world and im really pleased and grateful i want to pay tribute to the team for the way theyve collectively navigated that and during that whole process the external environment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past five years and the outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and the financial performance in q1 i also want to say thanks to mark with such volatility in an external environment any ceo needs the support of their chair their advice their guidance and ive had that all the way through and have had the support from the board all the way through in navigating what has been a very complex external environment but the team the board mark just collectively weve done a good job in navigating it now if i look forward im not going to give a todo list to my successor because that is not the fair thing to do to anyone but i will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very much focused on and im focused on for as long as im still ceo and that is continuing the momentum you dont work as hard as weve worked for the past five years and then take the eye off the ball at this moment in time so im very focused on a smooth orderly transition im very focused on continued execution of the strategy i want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy we have exited a lot of businesses a lot of rwas over the past five years the one thing weve protected whilst doing that is the international core of hsbc the countries we remain in the businesses we remain in are fundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of hsbc and we will continue to do that our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are sustainable and repeatable whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they emerge in a world that becomes more stable and that are inherent in our customer franchise therefore were very focused on continuing the development of wealth our transaction banking capabilities our global wholesale banking capabilities and then being ready for when hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 corporate loan demand picks up we can take advantage of that so a couple good returns with sustainable growth and i think youve seen evidence of that in these results hong kong is subdued at the moment but we understand why with the rate differential in china but if you look at the rest of the world as george said theres balance sheet growth in wholesale banking in the rest of asia in the middle east in uk in europe were seeing good growth elsewhere so its about focus momentum continuing to couple good returns with good growth georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you raul next question please operator operator instructions our next question today comes from ph jeremy hu at cicc please accept the prompt to unmute your line georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc ph jeremy youre on mute yes please go ahead we can hear you q can you hear me georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes q okay so the first question is on deposits were glad to see that the casa migration in hong kong is slowing down but is not stabilized at this level but on the other hand i think the bank has seen some deposit outflow in q1 while your hong kong local peers still see some deposit growth so im wondering if there is strategic tradeoff between the deposit growth and casa for you at this stage and how do you see that trend in the rest of the year the second question is on the structural hedge so im wondering if this quarter you could share with us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the reinvestment of the structural hedge and if there is any run rate that we can refer to thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you ph jeremy so on your first question about deposits in hong kong so if you remember at q4 our deposits in hong kong have increased by about billion what weve seen in q1 this year is a decrease of about billion therefore you can see seasonality playing across the two quarters and therefore is broadly stable across the two quarters hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 what happened though is some of these deposit inflows in q4 related to some deposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth and when you look at q1 while you see the deposit outflows you also can see that billion of our net new invested assets were in asia therefore a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated into wealth inflows for us which was the purpose of the campaign in q4 and explains if you want the seasonality of this deposit second look we have a powerful deposit franchise we have a very cherished and viable franchise we continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail and wholesale customers we cherish this we continue investing in our deposit capabilities and throughout the last six quarters youve seen how our deposit base has been very stable with our deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers therefore i wont comment on monthtomonth movements between ourselves and our peers if i move on to your second question about the structural hedge so first you would have noticed that we increased this quarter the structural hedge by about billion taking it to billion with the weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of three years second we commit at this stage to continue our structural hedging activity obviously this will remain subject to market conditions but we will continue the trend that we put in q1 based on current market outlook this activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind to our banking nii and this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted as you know and you can do the math but equally we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates and this reinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into banking nii between the two of those effects the structural hedge activity for the fullyear would remain a net tailwind to our banking nii we have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind were looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space but that tailwind has been factored into our guidance of at least billion banking nii and obviously factored into our return on tangible equity midteens guidance thank you ph jeremy we can move to the next question please operator thank you george the next question today comes from jason napier at ubs please accept the prompt to unmute your line georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hello jason jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch good morning can you hear me georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc we can hear you jason good morning jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 fantastic thank you first of all just to echo the best wishes noel for the next chapter of your career and private life i think noel and rebalancing noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch george i just wondered whether you talk a little bit within the context of higher for longer youve referenced subdued loan demand in hong kong due to the differentials in interest rates and i just wonder whether one of your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as loan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue so i wonder whether you might talk a little bit about whether thats a material part of the plan and sort of what you think that means for revenue sort of evolution in the next few quarters i think i certainly was somewhat surprised that we didnt see an upgrade to banking nii guidance this quarter i know you dont rebalance every quarter but i just wonder whether you might talk to the role that higher for longer has on asset mix and then on credit demand and then secondly wealth was phenomenal in q1 i know theres a part of the business thats quite closely linked to what goes on with the hang seng index which is now at in a short space of time but i just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates is that the strategy delivering the sort of net new money flows or is there an element of sort of market vol in there that we should be a little bit careful about thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you jason so first on banking nii we recognize there are kind of a couple of encouraging developments the first one is the higher for longer on the rate side that would look like more favorable than when we discussed last in february and the second one we just touched on which is the balance sheet mix specifically in hong kong where weve seen term deposits remain stable for this quarter so we recognized these tailwinds to our banking nii but we also recognized quite early in the year these factors can still change so this is why we didnt change our guidance and as you said jason i dont think you should expect us to update our guidance every quarter we will reconsider this every quarter but for this quarter were just sticking with our at least billion in terms of the wealth performance so recognized midteens percentage growth in wealth for our private bank i would say couple of things the first one is yes this is an area that weve already said its a focused strategic area we are investing in this area big part of our investments goes towards this area and were very pleased to see the results of our investments generate revenue fairly quickly you can see that through net new invested assets growth you can see that through our csm new business csm growth in insurance as well as in the actual revenue performance this being said i would just caution you not to annualize the numbers youre seeing because q1 had somewhat a subdued january in it when china and hong kong were still closed so therefore youve seen more hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 pickup in activity in the q1 at the back end of it whereas we had a full proper q1 so there is an element of not annualizing the performance but expecting that performance to continue growing i just realized i didnt touch on your asset mix question of the first question look we do not foresee a material change in our asset mix we had seen for the last few quarters of last year the main growth take place in mortgages and recognizing mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in the uk and hong kong and the margins have been quite tight as we start seeing pickup in wholesale demand as we start seeing pickup in unsecured lending we are more hopeful that those will drive higher margins than if you want what weve seen in mortgages and our numbers in q1 did show that this pickup definitely is there in areas of asia southeast asia india the middle east the uk et cetera and the next in line for that pickup will be hong kong which we expect at some stage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease thanks jason operator operator instructions our next question comes from perlie mong at kbw please accept the prompt to unmute your line perlie mong q analyst keefe bruyette woods thank you for taking my question can i just dig a little bit further into jasons question just now on higher for longer so i know you probably dont like to comment on longerterm nii but i guess in a higher for longer rate environment just how are you thinking about the trajectory going from here because it sounds to me that deposit migration has probably well stabilized a lot and i would have thought any longer pricing that hasnt already come through will come through in the next few months and i guess as in a higher for longer rate environment you can probably build more hedges at better rates as well et cetera and theres obviously a tailwind as you mentioned in this year already so how does that inform your thinking on your mediumterm rote and so i guess thats the first question and the second question again on broader activity level maybe not just on credit so again i guess just noting your point that hong kong might be next in line to pick up but i guess overall the emerging market is probably not benefiting in terms of activity level and in terms of capital inflows from higher us rates so how does that impact i guess trading activities capital flows et cetera just how are you thinking about the flip side of higher for longer thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you perlie so first look yes we recognize higher for longer is definitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind with forecast in our banking nii and as i said there has been a number of manifestation of tailwinds now compared to when we last spoke in february but equally it is early in the year and as youve seen these things do change and we therefore want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing parameters we will update some longer than what we are updating but not at this quarter perlie so do expect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future i would say the one parameter just to keep in mind as you start planning for is take argentina out because obviously subject to the sale completing which hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 we expect to complete in the next month that potential billion contribution from argentina will go away from our banking nii thats the most kind of predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into in terms of the broader activity level i mean first if you look at the wealth performance just demonstrates how wealth remains very resilient and thats particularly true in hong kong but very much so across asia second when you look at our transaction banking activities apart from foreign exchange which has an idiosyncrasy related to q1 with a very high volatility has performed across the various areas of its feeearning activities and then our activity is very much benefiting from crossborder trends if you look at some of the investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intraregion in asia between china and asean between india and asean between india and the west et cetera all of those trends are growing i mean the numbers are staggering in some cases and these are the activities that our business is operating on so therefore while recognizing that there will be some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels there is still a very strong underlying network activity which is benefiting our overall businesses particularly in wholesale transaction banking and wealth thank you perlie perlie mong q analyst keefe bruyette woods quick followup on that its just ive also noticed that china export volume has been going up but value has been coming down and that is in part because of various things fx is well part of it but also government subsidies how does that affect i guess your profitability in the region in volumes going up and values going down noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc perlie if i can just give you an indication what we are seeing at the moment is a very strong level of activity of china corporates expanding across the rest of asia so our outbound activity from mainland china to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase in activity over the past months weve seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this year so a lot of people talk about inward investment into china slowing down but what i would say is outward investment from china to the rest of the world is actually picking up a quite a pace a very significant pace were very well placed to capture that outflow and we are capturing that outflow and our business in mainland china performed well last year its performing well again in the first quarter of this year and its outbound activity is performing extremely well so well give more updates on that at the half year but we are capturing that and that is why actually i think the rest of asia is performing well on balance sheet because a lot of it is being fed by good intraasia activity and outbound from mainland china georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay thank you perlie operator our next question today comes from katherine lei at jpmorgan please accept the prompt to unmute your line katherine lei q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 okay thanks i have three questions three small questions actually the first one is on noninterest income i look at the breakdown on noninterest income it seems like wealth is doing quite well but on transaction banking there is some weakness i think its down yoy can we know what is the reason and should we triangulate this to the full year what are the drivers to that so this is the first one the second one is on hong kong with hong kong relaxing the ltv ratios i think basically they not only the ltv but they relaxed the purchase requirements and the stamp duty requirements on residential properties so i think that there is a significant jump in transactions so i was thinking that this should be positive to mortgage at least and then we are big mortgage providers in hong kong so would that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth particularly related to hong kong second one and then the last one i think is on cost if i look at the first quarter i think cost is up including levy how should i look at this and then are we on track to the cost growth this year thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you katherine ill take question one and three and ill hand over to noel to address your second question about the outlook for hong kong so first on nonnii wealth has performed well transaction banking weakness is specifically due to foreign exchange thats driving the whole weakness and the reason as i called it out earlier the reason is that foreign exchange had a very strong and a record strong quarter one on the back of a heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis so therefore were doing a comparison to a record quarter and it will show that drop but if you look at the number itself at the revenue itself with foreign exchange it is back to normalized levels so there is nothing to worry about here its on the contrary back to normalized levels and we continue to expect some cyclicality in that space while we continue expecting growth in the other areas of transaction banking so i wouldnt read more than that into it and we remain very confident that the investment were putting both in wealth and transaction banking and in the technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain a strategic focus and bearing results as we look into future quarters and years on your third question about cost so first i just want to reiterate it is a clear priority for us to maintain cost discipline okay and we are very confident we will limit cost growth to circa on a target basis were confident about it and were actually on track to do so and the reason why were kind of on track to do so yet we showed a quarter one growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic items related to the quarter which are not repeated in future quarters or some of them will reverse in future quarters ill just call the three of them out that matter first there was a accrual of the performancerelated pay where we decided to phase that accrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year this will manifest in a higher performancerelated pay accrual in q1 hence the contribution towards the but it will contribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a fullyear basis we are not accruing to a significantly different number than the fullyear performance related pay hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 second there was sic percentage point contribution from hsbc innovation banking this quarter because last years first quarter we only acquired svb in the middle of march which means we only we practically didnt have it in the first quarter last year and thats a base effect and then third we had the oneoffs or the nonrec well expected nonrecurrence of the fdic special assessment additional charge this quarter as well as the bank of england levy bank of england levy is a new charge which used to be an interest expense as an nii and now its moved to operations expense as in cost and those between the two of them they contributed to sic percentage point so if you adjust for those and you bake them in we are still and we remain confident to meet our cost target on a full year or circa on a full year basis on your second question ill hand over to noel about hong kong outlook noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah hi katherine i was in hong kong recently and spoke to a number of the market participants there and the developers and i think firstly i think the change the stamp duty arrangements in hong kong in march in the budget was very well received and its had a positive impact on the activity levels of sales in the hong kong market residential sales it was an extremely significant inflow of activity in the first month that will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions of many of those developers we have to wait and see how that stabilizes because undoubtedly there was an element of catchup in that first month because people were anticipating some change therefore there was low activity in the preceding months and i think we got to see how that stabilizes but i think that is a very positive move it will enhance liquidity within the market it will enhance activity in the mortgage market but i think its too early to call a trend at the moment i think we need to see how q2 stabilizes following those changes but a very helpful intervention thank you operator we have time for one last question today and that comes from andrew coombs at citigroup please accept the prompt to unmute your line andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you firstly just to commend noel as well on his five years as ceo we also acknowledge your long stint at hsbc beforehand too noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks andrew andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd and then two questions please firstly on the uk nim you see an improvement for second consecutive quarter another basis points so outperforming some of the domestic peers i can see your loans and deposit balances looking fairly flat in that entity and perhaps you could just comment on what youre seeing in terms of deposit hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 migration mortgage refi and whats driving that nim improvement and how sustainable even that improvement is going forward as well and then the second one just a clarification on argentina booked billion in q1 guiding to billion at full year based on last years experience presumably what youre therefore saying is a stepdown to billion per quarter for the remainder of the year given that you dont expect the transaction to necessarily close until months time thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you andrew so the uk nim was up basis point indeed essentially benefited from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural hedge maturities and reinvestments so if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of plus or minus basis points i would say uk nim has been broadly flat for the last couple of quarters and we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter and you will therefore add to that broadly flat some structural hedge idiosyncrasies which will drive you within this plus or minus basis point range as regards our loans and deposits have been stable again the uk economy has been resilient were very optimistic about the outlook for the uk specifically around inflation and employment it remains a very important customer franchise for us it remains a very important market for us and we continue gaining market share i mean we continue gaining market share in mortgages with a new business market share when our back book now market share has moved from or our kind of overall portfolio market share has moved from to we have market share in sme lending and obviously we continue investing in this business you can look at the ringfenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment growth for the ring fenced bank within our overall circa cost growth so all this demonstrates the confidence we have in our business in the uk our clients activity in the uk and the outlook for the uk if i move to argentina i wish i could give you a trend for argentina then the way it works is the numbers balloon with hyperinflation and then they kind of they shrink with devaluation and it depends how they manifest themselves monthovermonth q4 last year has seen a hyperinflation to some level but theyve seen a massive devaluation if you recall in december weve seen more than currency devaluation thats contributed to a disinflation of the amount that banking nii argentina brought to q4 and then this quarter is exactly the opposite weve seen devaluation only but weve seen inflation and that will just inflate the numbers so it will be volatile quarteronquarter and our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it average out over last year which is around billion now just looking at the overall argentina if you take in the nonbanking nii and you take in the cost base et cetera last years argentina contribution to our pbt was billion but just to put it in perspective this is about earnings per share or dividend per share therefore i think as you look at the fullyear thats the quantum that argentina volatility will create so it should not distract you from the way youre forecasting the banks outcomes andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd i guess just to follow up on this in a scenario whereby you didnt have any devaluation of peso inflation was a more moderate normal amount what would the nii contribution be under that more kind of bau scenario a quarter for argentina hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc look again its a difficult one to say but if you just do the arithmetics of our billion expected for the full year of which already billion has manifested in the first quarter a smooth out outcome would be the other billion phased out evenly over three quarters but thats a highly volatile number so i wouldnt use it as a sort of a forecast andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd okay understood georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah andrew coombs q analyst
