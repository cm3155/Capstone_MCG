this is not the standard we intend to operate by in the future and we will notify you in a timely manner in the future quarters however we made some big promises for this meeting when we met on march which was a very tall order and being a new management team not only did we have to obtain and analyze information we had to ensure we had both controls and processes and completed the credit review that we had indicated that we would conduct as i indicated when we first got together on march i had really three overarching items that i wanted to focus on in my first weeks the first was to reevaluate and get our forecast accurate and formulate strategies around the businesses we wanted to conduct review and understand our credit risk in the portfolio and it was very important for us to engage with our regulators and develop relationships because they were very important to our overall organization and building our risk framework we think that these were in critical components we think weve done a tremendous amount of work on that and we think youll find through the slide presentation today we came along really a long ways in the last four weeks since the new team has come together new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 so now turning to the first quarter during the quarter the company took a number of actions designed to lay down the groundwork for our return to longterm sustainable profitability more in line with our regional bank peers first and foremost we successfully completed little over billion equity raise anchored by liberty strategic capital a firm led by former treasury secretary steven mnuchin along with hudson bay capital management reverence capital partners and citadel global equities the completion of this equity raise significantly strengthens our capital and liquidity position and really demonstrates the confidence that the new investors have in the turnaround currently underway at the company second we bolstered our board of directors and executive management team in conjunction with the capital raise we reduced the size of our board to nine members and added five new directors all who bring extensive banking and turnaround experience to the bank in addition i have known for a long time and view them as independent thinkers and will challenge management appropriately as very strong board members more recently we announced the appointment of four senior leaders to our executive management team each who have deep industry knowledge and extensive backgrounds in their respective fields i think when you think about the characteristics of the people that have joined us they all are coming from very strong organizations with backgrounds from organizations like us bank bank of america and most of us have worked together either at one of those institutions or at onewest bank so we understand the kind of culture and the type of risk organization that we want collectively to build and we all came from those organizations that reviewed and the industry as very high performing organizations im confident together with the newly reconstructed board well be able to drive our strategic initiatives forward and solidify our position as the leading regional bank weve done this before and we feel we can do it again third we completed an indepth due diligence process of our multifamily and commercial real estate portfolios including the office portfolio performed both by the bank and separately by an independent thirdparty we increased our credit loss reserves as a result of information from this review and other analysis we performed during the quarter now ill take you through the earnings presentation beginning with slide on slide it highlights some of our strategy and as i said we bolstered the management and the board weve developed what we think we can share with you today a realistic operating plan to get the organization by the end of at or above industry standards for performance we have achievable capital and earnings forecasts we have implemented now a rigorous credit risk management process and weve strengthened the talent on the credit risk process and we maintain sufficient liquidity as we walked you through earlier today our future targets are that we will be a strong diversified regional bank producing a return on average assets of a return on average total tce of to and a cet1 ratio or and well walk you through those detail later today the goal is to create longterm meaningful shareholder value will obviously be a transition year to a more normalized and and page gives you a highlight and on that page of the people are new to the company within the last five months and that adjuncts three important people that were legacy nycb and flagstar people who have joined the organization and slide gives a quick overview of the board members and the depth and knowledge that they bring to the organization new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 on slide slide is a key slide outlining our path to profitability as you can see we feel that we have multiple levers to get us there and ill spend a few minutes kind of walking our way through that so our number one obviously as you know the industry is confronted with the rapid rise in interest rates a lot of the loans that were fixed rates that had either three five or seven interest rate resets a number of those are starting to come forward now and will go through a repricing process and so that will benefit obviously net interest income and nim number two focus on workout of problem loans we recently brought new resources into the company to bolster the talent in dealing with the workout side of our organization and this obviously will have longterm reductions in our npa number three we will begin to build a more robust middle market relationship banking franchise today we roughly have billion in ci loan outstandings in the portfolio that will create a really good basis for us to move forward and we see that business over billion in the next three to five years just as a comment really i spent the vast majority of my career in this space we successfully grew this business at us bank under my leadership we created that business at onewest bank in a very short order and put billions of dollars in new loan outstanding attracted the right kind of talent and i think that we will be able to do that here and that will be one of the more successful areas of our story when we look to have a balanced balance sheet on number five we look to fully integrate all three banks currently today in we integrated the flagstar and nycb onto a single platform called fiserv and we have the signature legacy is on fis and so we will look to get to one platform in the future and obviously its a very costly proposition when youre operating on two different platforms and consolidating that from an informational perspective and number six the efficiency ratio tells the story we are an organization with an efficiency ratio most of us came from us bank where jerry grundhofer taught us how to squeeze nickels and so its in our culture in our dna and we will aggressively look at our cost structure and make determinations of how we will be able to bring that back in with industry standards as far as mediumterm items we will as i indicated look to diversify our loan portfolio our commercial real estate portfolio today is around billion our strategic target to bring that down around the billion range well improve funding by growing core deposits and we think that will be helpful by building more relationship type strategies and then number three indiscernible derivatives commercial cards and syndication capabilities and we can drive those further and deeper into our relationships one comment i would like to make back on to the top in the short term i jumped over number four which is sale or runoff of nonstrategic assets we continue to look at the portfolio of assets on the balance sheet and started a process within the organization were reviewing that and we do have and we have identified an opportunity that could close quickly for billion at par minus a transaction fee that we believe could close within a to day period that we may be announcing here in the next week or so so weve already begun that process of looking at which assets fit strategically going forward and by doing that well obviously create additional capital for the balance sheet and well obviously create billion of liquidity and with that im going to turn it over to craig gifford our newly appointed cfo who ive really enjoyed the opportunity to partner with on this project hes a man of tremendous strengths and talents and so craig ill turn it over to you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 craig e gifford chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you joseph and thanks to all those who were able to join the call today i look forward to meeting many of you in the near future over the next few slides ill take you through how we think about our forecast our loan portfolio and our credit risk and our deposit base and liquidity if you turn to slide you can see a summary of the next three years expectations of our financial performance at the very beginning you can see that we expect our diluted eps and this is on a fully converted basis for our outstanding preferred growing from our current level through to about to at the end of as joseph mentioned you can see that we have expectations to reduce our efficiency ratio down to from the current level down to peer levels and we will see that happening through integration of our previous mergers and a close look at our overlapping cost structures our capital ratios were certainly bolstered by the recent capital infusion that joseph mentioned and we see that moving to peer levels over the next two years through our earnings power and retention of the earnings into capital our return on assets we see improving through a rebalancing of our asset mix as well as loan repricing into current market rates our return on equity our return on tangible equity will benefit as a result of these items and will drive us back to an to return on tangible capital over the outlook period and finally we believe that that will result in a tangible book value in the range as we get to the end of these all reflect the strategies that joseph outlined on the previous page if you turn to page this is really where the rubber meets the road how is this going to happen starting at the top of our income statement our net interest income will benefit as we see loans reprice over the next couple of years our expectations with respect to rates that weve built into these numbers follow the median rate forecast we have about billion a year over the next three years that will reprice and thats reflected in these numbers were actually relatively interest rate risk insensitive right now we recently exited some indiscernible swaps that moved us into a relatively flat neutral position our net interest margin certainly decreased this quarter that was a result really of two things our need to move into a bit more a different shift in our funding mix and more wholesale funding as well as an increase in our borrowing costs we expect to see that improve over the next two years again principally a result of repricing of our loan portfolio from a provision expense as joseph mentioned after taking a deep dive look at our credit portfolio and looking at current market conditions we did increase our loan loss reserves in the quarter we do expect to see an elevated level of provisioning through the rest of the year as market conditions potentially impact more borrowers but after that we expect to see a return to a more normalized throughthecycle level of losses and we have shown you our expectations here our noninterest income expectations are relatively flat in these targets but we actually see upside as we balance our customer mix towards broader relationships as joseph mentioned noninterest expense we do expect that well be able to drive efficiencies through our platform as we focus on as we focus on our merger activity we have systems processes and infrastructure duplication that we do believe that present us opportunities to reduce our costs over the forecast period weve assumed between and reduction in our cost structure if you move to slide you can see where we currently stand our equity position our equity infusion in march has us at cet1 ratio on a fully converted basis you can see that the reserve increase that we did in the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 first quarter brings us to a allowance to loan loss as a percent of total loans excluding our warehouse loans and importantly and ill cover this in a few minutes in more depth of our deposits are insured deposits we have a very low level of uninsured deposits compared to our peers at the moment if you move to slide ill talk a little bit about our loan portfolio and the level of credit review that we did on a number of our higher risk positions in the first quarter this slide presents our loan portfolio in total at the left and then covers on the righthand side the number of loans and the percentage of the portfolio that we did what we refer to as a deep dive that deep dive involved a lot of internal analysis as well as getting thirdparty information about property valuations and weve taken that information and considered the credit exposure in the portfolio and i would say it confirms the potential for credit loss that was previously disclosed in our materials you can see on the bottom righthand side the dollars and the percent of the portfolio that we covered and ill cover the office and multifamily portfolios in detail on the next two pages but at a high level we had a deep dive on roughly of our office portfolio and roughly of our multifamily portfolio if you move to slide you can see what im saying in the top righthand corner we did a deep dive review of billion of a billion office portfolio certainly office portfolio the office portfolio is in a market segment that is suffering a high degree of stress our overall it doesnt represent a particularly large percentage of our overall loan portfolio at only billion and you can see that we on the bottom righthand side stand at a allowance to total office loans excluding owneroccupied loans on the bottom left you can see that in our deep dive review we covered our top loans and those had an average principal balance of about million the remainder of the portfolio is fairly homogenous on average loan balance you can see of about million and we believe those have a differentiated credit risk largely because they have more refinancing options just given their loan size if you move to slide you can see more information about our multifamily portfolio its certainly our largest segment in the loan portfolio at billion you can see that we covered of that portfolio in our deep dive credit review and on the lefthand side you can see that at the end of the quarter we have a allowance to total loan coverage ratio in the multifamily portfolio again on the bottom right you can see that the loan sizes that we covered in our deep dive were those loans that were largely above million and the loan sizes that we think of as more of a homogenous basis portfolio are around million in the bullets youll note that we expect about billion of our multifamily book to reprice in i mentioned an expectation of about billion in total weve had very good success with repricing of our existing portfolio over the last months weve had billion of loans that have repriced about a fourth of those have actually paid off at the repricing date and the other threefourths have repriced up to current market rates and weve seen almost no delinquencies todate in other words the borrowers have been able to cover debt service in spite of the elevated level of interest rates if you move to slide we have some information on our nonoffice portfolio roughly billion importantly you can see on the bottom right that we have a very diverse book theres no real credit concentrations we did review about a fourth of this book and we dont really see any stresses in the rest of the portfolio on page is a break out of our allowance for loan losses and ill just point out that on the multifamily portfolio again were at allowance coverage ratio thats up basis points from basis points at the first quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 assuming that yearend and again you can see the office allowance ratio is the office ratio in particular puts us at the high end of the range compared to our regional bank peers moving to liquidity deposits and liquidity if you turn to page youll see in the top left hand side that roughly of our deposit base are transactional and lower cost funding its not a cdfocused book that said we have looked to the cd market for some recent funding needs bottom left hand side importantly you can see that our deposit base has been very stable since the capital infusion and in fact weve grown deposits and thats not only through the end of march but subsequent to the end of march to date in april weve seen a very stable deposit base and stable growth im sure you know youve seen that in the market we have a premium product we call it the ph product importantly were seeing good traction but its not so large as to move our margin its focused on new money and new customers that we are bringing to the bank and i would say that its not driving an overall wholesale repricing of our deposit book if you turn to slide as i mentioned before the vast majority of our deposits are insured deposits we only have billion of uninsured deposits and on this slide you can see that we have more cash on the balance sheet than the entire amount of our uninsured deposits thats quite unusual compared to regional bank peers in fact from a total liquidity perspective we have over of our uninsured deposits we continue to focus on building liquidity and as joseph mentioned as we look at potential strategic portfolio transactions we would expect to see some degree of further built in liquidity coming from those transactions slide is just a brief look at our first quarter financial highlights we had a net loss to shareholders to common shareholders of million for the quarter that was largely driven by the provisioning of million for the quarter certainly elevated there was a bit of noise as well in our net loss related to our mergerrelated activities which we see declining throughout the year and dont see that carrying over into and and then we also had a bit of noise related to some adjustments from the previous bargaining gain that we recorded last year as we close out the accounting associated with the signature transaction excluding those and a more and at a more normal provision level you can see that our base operations were actually at a slight net income level in the first quarter and now id like to turn the call back to joseph thank you joseph m otting president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc okay thank you craig first of all i appreciate your patience since this is really our first opportunity to get together with all of you we thought it was very important to go through the deck as opposed to just reading opening comments that you could get really the context and details of where the organization is today and then how we see that transforming into the future so i hope you found that helpful and useful and we clearly look forward craig and i do to meeting a number of you and following up and having discussions in further detail and really what other areas of the packet that you would like to have one of the things that we look at is what is the upside for the company and we are currently trading at roughly of fully converted tangible book value of this compares to about times for category iv banks and about times for regional banks i believe this valuation gap will narrow significantly as we execute on our transformation plan and this plan is were all experienced of going down this journey in this path weve done it before new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 we know what the end looks like we know what we have to do to execute on it and we as an executive management team are optimistic that we can deliver on the plan its going to be a lot of hard work we recognize that but this is a strong team thats come together with a very diversified background that has been in environments what they see with the strong regional banks can kind of look like so finally id like to really thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to the bank and our customers as you can appreciate ive been here slightly under eight weeks now craig has been here two and a half weeks but it was very important for us to be able to kind of meet with you as soon as possible and give you an overview on the organization and we look forward to fielding any questions from the group and operator i will turn it back over to you now for you to be able to call on people for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi ebrahim craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning craig so appreciate the reason that you all claim around business strategy and credit maybe first question with i guess both of you know this better than most we are in a tough interest rate backdrop just talk to us when you talk about growing the core deposit franchise which is extremely tough right now for even the best of banks in terms of the nuts and bolts of how you can execute that without undue pressure on deposit costs and also if you dont mind addressing theres been a fair amount of chatter about talent leaving nyb over the last few weeks like how impactful would that be and how much of that is baked into your forecast and outlook from here thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you very much so the first question is when you look at kind of the legacy organization it was kind of a monoline business where they focused on multifamily and then they raised high money market and cd rates to new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 fund that and then the evolution with flagstar brought more relationship deposits into the fold and then the third leg of that was the signature bank joining the organization through the fdicassisted transaction so weve been able to through those processes get to is when craig showed on the chart of our deposits are actually noninterest bearing and interest bearing which are transactionrelated accounts and if you ask most people ebrahim whos your bank most people identify no matter if you have million in your brokerage account and you have your mortgage with somebody they usually identify with whose their checking account is and so we have a strong baseline in our retail franchise to be able to grow off those relationships and then as we look to expand into the ci business usually if you can be important to the customer stack and usually in the middle market in the specialty industry business theres usually three to five banks and if you can be important in that stack you will usually get the relationship products and those will be deposits cash management derivatives syndication activity and so really our big focus is developing and recruiting talent into that space and building upon what we already have we do already have some very good businesses in that space and thats where i think as we execute on that strategy youll get less interest sensitive clients and more clients that are interested in supporting the overall relationship the second part of your question i think dealt with the signature bank and what i would say about signature bank is we really want to build the baseline of our ci commercial business around the signature bank teams we really have a unique franchise that we were able to obtain where we have commercial bankers and private banking people from signature bank that are really in some of the most lucrative markets in the united states are in the southwest the northeast the southeast and then around the greater lakes i will say it has been a tough integration of them into our bank some of it has been our fault and we have to take responsibility that not all of our products have flowed effectively for them but i would also say some of the clients did not some of the legacy clients of signature did not meet our bsa standards and those clients are no longer with flagstar so there also was a little bit of a uniqueness of trying to fit they had a decentralized risk model we have a centralized risk model so i think there was a higher standard around that but we have lost roughly people in that group we do track on a daily basis the departure balance when the teams left was million and today the current balance is billion so roughly slightly less than million of deposits have left and we do recognize some deposits will take time to migrate out of the organization but i think weve done a couple theres been a couple of contrary things why that has stuck is when those teams left they frequently did not take the whole team so the team was they took and left people those seven people have done an extraordinary job of stepping up and calling on those contacts and retaining those and that really has been quite positive and where there were smaller teams where the whole team left we quickly reassigned those to other teams and so i think the combination of that has helped us be able to retain a significant amount of those deposits and be in a position to kind of move forward so theres always that risk for some more deposits but it isnt like weve had a big wholesale and as craig pointed out on the slide weve had very weve actually had pretty good growth in deposits during the quarter and we continue to see that carrying through into april as well and really its strong growth in the retail franchise and growth in the private bank so where you would perhaps anticipate that that would be rolling down its actually been rolling up new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no thanks craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc and just to add on as joseph mentioned theres been very little deposit departures since the press associated with the adviser with the group of advisors that left a couple of hundred billion im sorry yeah a couple hundred million dollars of departures all of that occurred in the first two weeks and over the last couple of weeks its just been a trickle very positive joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ebrahim one of the other things is like most of the those teams have left for small banks and some of these clients just cant be serviced by those small banks so they may move part of their relationship but if theyre fully integrated into the bank its very complicated to delink the treasury management and all the services and systems that you have so my guess is well have split relationships with some of those small banks if things that can move over but weve been able to retain a significant portion of the deposits and activities craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc and weve been calling ph sandra and i have spent a lot of time calling on the private banking clients meeting with the people trying to understand as i said some of this is our fault the integration process so making sure we understand how we can be more responsive to credit needs account opening and those things that can make it more transparent for those customers to integrate into the bank ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color and if i can have one quick follow up so appreciate all the deep dive youve done on the office and multifamily when all this began there was a lot of concern around new york city rent stabilized multifamily book and i appreciate theres more to do in terms of the deep dive review just give us a sense like for the longest time ive covered the bank it felt like the lost content in that book should be minimal and i would love to hear your thoughts in terms of how we should think about the rent stabilized new york city multifamily and your view on the cost content thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well couple of things i mean we all know about the legislative changes and then the expectation perhaps that the supreme court would rule against that and they havent so were kind of in the army so to speak with what we have we may have hit the low point now that some of the jurisdictions are doing tax abatements weve looked at the very big multifamilies that have large exposures and well do more work on the remainder of the portfolio during this particular quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 but as we say the revenue was pretty solid in that space i mean theres very few vacancies they know the revenue where theres been problems really is how on the other side of the operating expenses have risen people will tell you buy a new hvac system its or higher than what it was two years ago hiring people to do work on site interest rate resets just a lot of negative consequences on the expense side we on one of the chart pages craig yeah chart i think one of the important parts about our portfolio is is if you looked at its the part that shows the past due indiscernible the one that shows the past due so to days past due anyway while hes finding that page ebrahim one of the things that our portfolio has exhibited is amazing resiliency where clients are not going past due so where we see that perhaps the property is over a loan to value and just for the properties that debt service coverage is low to these are frequently longtime owned properties by families and they are supporting those properties from resources amongst the family because they dont want those property to lose those properties and well in those instances we dont have guarantees potential tax liabilities are motivating people to be at the table with us negotiating to make sure that they have time to kind of manage their way and ebrahim what i was referencing is on page the third item up from the bottom is or excuse me second item up from the bottom is total loans to days past due at the end of the first quarter we were versus category iv was and then to was so our portfolio while we do feel theres loss given defaults and probability defaults the portfolio has held up very well from the standpoint of the borrowers continuing to make payments ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys and congrats on getting all this together in such a short period of time its very impressive following up on your comments on the billion in deposits appreciate all the color on that whats the mix of that billion thats remaining so what portion of that is dda versus interestbearing or higher rate cds and then if you could just talk about how many of those teams are remaining at the bank and where do you stand with lockups and whatnot with the remaining private bank teams and how youre managing that relationship at this point going forward joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 yeah theres about teams left with the bank today so if you said there was roughly at the beginning theres left and we have in place cash payment after one year cash payment after two years and then an equity rsrs that would vest in the third year kind of on a cliff vesting and but i would also say dave money is one thing but if youre servicing your clients in that space and they have a really unique model which i actually like is there are single point of contact for their customers and im supportive of that model if youre not able to support your clients youre going to be frustrated and youre not going to stay at an institution you dont think that will give you those tools and so really weve got to fix that and if we can fix that i think people can really have a successful career here and we can take care of their clients because we have the ability to execute so lockups are one thing but if youre not able to take care of your customers and thats your franchise then i dont think theres any money that would keep you out at the bank and i dont know if you have the number craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc to put some numbers around the deposit mix that billion only about million of that is cds so its not its stable because of the relationships in the business not because of maturity terms structure david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc what piece of that is dda noninterest bearing craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc i dont have that number in front of me but the bulk of it is transactional accounts david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it what do you think in terms of the timing of ironing out all the issues on the service side joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc weve been all over it its been one of my personal initiatives we meet we have met and continue to meet with indiscernible bankers but ill be honest with you most of them are just really good commercial bankers and were kind of working through we first worked through some of the approval levels that were assigned and we got them back to kind of what their approval levels were with signature bank and then weve been working through the credit process weve assigned a particular person to work through how credits get approved so for the most part i think were ironing those kind of things out weve kind of basically gone down to a trickle of people leaving at this point so i really think the people that are here are engaged and they want to be part of the organization david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys appreciate it new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah thank you craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please go ahead mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning and thank you for all the detail joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co i wondered if you could share with us what youre assuming for the balance sheet size craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yes we can we are not assuming any significant reduction in the modeling that represents the numbers on pages and in our balance sheet size as joseph mentioned we are thinking about and looking at a number of strategic transactions but we dont have a balance sheet reduction as our principal target well make strategic moves that are right for the business and right for our balance sheet and importantly increase our shareholder returns mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly i think your lead independent director had suggested on cnbc recently that the company could be used as a rollup vehicle for more fdic deals when do you think thats conceivable is any of that baked into your plan through joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc its not baked into our plan what i would obviously with my background of being the comptroller of the currency i have good visions into what a good credit or good risk management infrastructure looks like what is first line of defense and second line of defense and third line of defense should be and by no means are we in a position in the shortterm to be in that position to be acquiring other entities well clean up our house and get it in order and really our focus is to work with our regulators at the occ and the fed theyre important partners to us to guide us and partner with us as we build the infrastructure here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 we have a lot of work to do in this organization to put the risk structure in place and were committed to doing that weve taken some actions where we formed a committee at the bank were hiring a person to coordinate in the organization its their job we formed a management committee were really focused on it and we want to deliver because we think its important for us were not doing it because anybody else wants us to do at kpmg or the regulator we want to do it because we think its important craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc and i would tell you that the financial impact of that infrastructure needs and build is included in the financial forecast so we would see that some of the opportunities for efficiency that well drive out of the business will be reinvested in developing risk management infrastructure mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co great and then just lastly would you consider selling a part of the branch franchise are there any sort of far flung areas where you see an opportunity to kind of shrink down part of the branch franchise joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i dont think so not at this point i think we really like the deposits and how the bank has operated in the retail bank if anything we would like to get more products that they could have available we obviously are really good at originating mortgages and being better at originating mortgages out of the branch could be a strong initiative reggie is focused on doing more small business lending out of the branches as well so i think were more into how do we enhance what we offer through our branch network theyve done a really strong job we have a very powerful deposit base out of the branch network and we think we can grow upon that mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning thanks for the question joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hey chris new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc can you share where you are looking to run the loantodeposit ratio over the next two to three years craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah i think that the loantodeposit ratio as we as our current balance sheet mix looks will continue out at least over the next months as we get beyond that and look at our wholesale funding and our onbalance sheet liquidity position you might see us move to a lower reliance on wholesale deposits im sorry on wholesale funding and perhaps an increase in deposits that would reduce that ratio a bit but i dont expect to see a transition significantly in the next months joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah indiscernible christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so itll remain elevated indiscernible craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well as we look at strategic transactions we might joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc we might see some reduction of loans that would reduce the loanstodeposit ratio just through strategic transactions that would be intended to drive liquidity as well as perhaps operational efficiency and ultimately shareholder value particularly by releasing some capital demand joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 right hey chris one of the id say the overarching strategies within the company is to really look at where we have scale and where we have relationships some businesses where we dont know the customer theyre just singularly using the balance sheet those would be businesses that probably would be complicated and difficult for us to hold on to in the future and the market today is theres a lot of buyers for that kind of product and so as we would execute on transactions as craig said that would give us the ability to use that liquidity either to reduce wholesale borrowings or increase our liquidity so christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc or invest in indiscernible joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and i guess as my followup twopart the billion you talked about that you might indiscernible can you share what asset class that is and also would the strategic decisions with the balance sheet also be considering like a crt transaction where you reduce riskweighted assets thanks joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah chris i wanted to make sure people are aware of it in case we announce it in a day or two but i dont want to go into details i think at this point its not appropriate to do that but we are right at the doorstep of deciding whether were going to move forward with that transaction craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc importantly that transaction would be accretive to our capital ratios it would reduce our capital demand and wouldnt have a significant effect on either immediate gains or losses or our earnings potential christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 hi good morning this is brian wilczynski filling in for manan can you talk about your approach to complying with the longterm debt rules that were proposed last year and related question is what do the rating agencies need to see in order for you to have a better rating thanks craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc ill move to the last one they need the second question they need to see a reliable path towards earnings and the ability to demonstrate our understanding of the credit risk i dont see that as a immediate term we certainly think that there are opportunities for us to demonstrate our understanding of the business and our financial performance in a repeatable way that could lead to upgrade potential or a positive outlook in a mediumterm timeframe in terms of the longterm debt rules i think where we stand from a capital position will benefit our funding will benefit as we continue to increase our capital ratios but we continue to evaluate our balance sheet position and havent really havent made any longterm decisions on how wed be structured there brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you and then just as a followup when it comes to bringing down the commercial real estate concentration can you give some more details on the types of commercial real estate that you might choose to maintain or grow over time versus what you are more likely to deemphasize joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well clearly the biggest concentration is in the multifamily sector of the portfolio so to move any significant numbers you would have to reduce your exposure in that particular area i would say from a risk perspective it would be our desire to reduce our exposure in the office marketplace weve done a pretty deep dive on billion of the billion of the portfolio and so clearly theres stress there i think theres been a fundamental change on how people are going to work and what space is going to be used in the future its just its difficult to see the end on office and so i would say if i was like where would i like to see the first reductions it would be in office but then eventually if you get down to that billion level we would definitely have to go into the multi family book and reduce our exposure there craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc but id say its more likely to be through how we manage our relationships and the transactions joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc as opposed to portfolio sales new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc right yeah i mean brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc our goal around here is like a if we have a relationship with you and the deposits then if you want to do something and its a good credit well still do it for you option b is if you want us to do a loan and youre really going to bring deposits back or we can gather a big part of your relationship well do those option c where you just want to use our balance sheet we wont do transactions like that in the future brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you for taking my questions joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome brian operator your next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with citi please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi ben joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i know you gave a good amount of information on the independent or excuse me the individual categories within your cre book just curious just because i mean multifamily you reviewed roughly a third some non office cre indiscernible is there any intention to do a complete or did you start with the largest just to make sure youre kind of youre in an appropriate area for your reserve levels new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so we started with the largest not only because its theyre large loans and we get more coverage with less count but because theyre generally more institutionally owned as opposed to either family owned or privately owned investments and the decisioning factors are different there as joseph pointed out additionally obviously as i mentioned the refinance risk is a more of a challenge when youre talking about a million credit as opposed to a million credit we will continue through our standard and improving credit processes to take a closer look at the smaller loan portfolio and id say the next cut would be in a more standardized approach to look at our portfolio balances over about a million threshold as we continue to look at that and as we continue to see borrower performance in the current environment that could impact our reserving levels but we believe that we have appropriate levels of reserves for the portfolio right now benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and just kind of following up joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hey ben one benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc go ahead joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc one other thing the next phase is were kind of looking at the large borrowers and what we mean by that is instead of large loans were going to look at whether its a consolidation of the borrowers and then also any relationship where theres million or more by june well be through that process so when we report to you next time as well well be able to kind of give some statistics around that so we are kind of waterfalling our way down through the portfolio to make sure that were comfortable with obviously the risk ratings and the reserves against the portfolio benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and then just to follow up here quickly i know you gave a guidance of an elevated loan loss provision throughout the rest of this year and it wanes pretty materially in and for this year what is it really predicated on is it more so allowance building or is there some sort of as you push things out you might have to be marking a loss similar to earlier this year just kind of im just trying to get a sense of why youre anticipating higher provisioning going forward indiscernible craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 well i think that no its a good question i think that what weve seen is repricing at higher interest rate levels obviously put stress on debt service coverage ratios for some borrowers weve had really good experience and thats particularly relevant to the way we model credit loss for reserving purposes but we also know that there will be some classes of borrowers that will experience stress and as we begin to get more insight into current market level debt service coverage ratios and see how those borrowers a broader population of those borrowers react in reset environments we could see that until we until the rate curve comes down that therell be additional stress our expectations are based upon the current rate curve and the current market conditions and those conditions could change the feds talking about high longer and higher longer and that could have an impact on future conditions and weve considered that as we put our forecast together benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator your next question will come from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning and thanks for taking all of our questions and information i wanted to drill down on the net reserve build so if we look at the provision guide that you gave us this year and next year what type of charge offs should we anticipate and how should net reserves change over time craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yes we anticipate an elevated level of chargeoffs we had about million this quarter and in our outlook we dont distinguish dramatically between chargeoffs and reserving i should say and reserve build because they all ultimately reflect the underlying credit loss of the portfolio but i think that well see a ramping of chargeoffs over the next couple of quarters and as we get out beyond that whether its the chargeoff or reserve build we think itll come back to a more normalized run rate credit loss christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and that some of those charge offs are taken would some of that be kind of new loans or the reset and just taken in the value impairment or would some of those be loans that leave the bank altogether craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so its loans that the chargeoffs this quarter are principally a couple of office loans and as we talked about the office market is pretty stressed and it was a couple of stressed office loans that got to the point where the investors chose to have a come to us and we had to take over the property i think i dont know that weve new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 taken on at this point but we look at them and we believe that a loss is likely on those its just a couple of its a couple of office loans christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks very much for the questions this morning joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc okay thank you operator your next question will come from the line of bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes hi good morning so regards to being a category iv bank in the 10k you noted anticipating significant expenses to develop policies programs and systems that comply with the enhanced standards would have assumed the revamping of risk management infrastructure would also be costly but i think craig you noted thats included in the forecast today so on todays call it sounds youre optimistic about driving expenses down which was seen in your forecast on page can you just help reconcile these expected cost pressures and efficiencies you expect over time craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi bernard thanks for the question so if you look on page you can see a walk forward as i mentioned its roughly a fiveyear between and reduction obviously there are some of those costs that are fixed that we cant do a lot about and there are other portions that are very manageable if you think about our organization we took three three it wasnt a large bank that rather a small bank and theres only a little bit of opportunity to drive efficiency out of the organization theres three banks that had three full sets of infrastructure and while weve partially been able to take advantage of the opportunities there theres certainly more to come as joseph mentioned we have a strong existing employee base but we brought in a number of management team members that have experience building risk management functions weve done this before and we have a pretty good feel of what that scale looks like and what the costs are for that and so as we think about our forecast for the future i think theres a pretty high degree of predictability around what the costs are associated with the risk management build and weve contemplated that in these numbers bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just another followup from the 10k you noted a number of items included in the remediation status of the reported material weaknesses identified by your auditors i mean just a few items noted included in frequency of reporting expanding the use of independent credit analysis reducing the reliance on internally created tools and just assessing staffing qualifications could you just help explain the situation you inherited it does sound like the department was working entirely on manual spreadsheets i have no defined reporting or guidelines so any color here would be helpful to just understand the situation that you inherited new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah i think that probably the biggest indicator of the situation was just that there wasnt as much visibility to the developing situation in the office market and to a small degree in the multifamily market and the impacts that that would have on provisioning so that ultimately passed through in the 10k and the fourth quarter in a big reserve i think what weve demonstrated here is that this management team along with the existing staff have done a good job to really catch up so to speak now our internal infrastructure still has a lot of improvement to go and we continue to work on those action plans again many of us are pretty new here and so were jumping into existing action plans and bringing our knowledge and experience into how we can further improve those so we have a ways to go were not done but over the last four to six weeks weve done a lot of work to make up for some of the previous deficiencies at least as we stand today joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and the other thing that i would add is we have brought very experienced talent into the company from jim simons who for years was the head approval officer and ran the workout for commercial real estate at us bank joined us hes called the special assistant to the president but we wanted jim to come in and look at all the processes the forecasting of the npls chargeoffs and so jim is working on that project right now and were adding additional staff into that infrastructure as well so we recognize the need to beat that up but we dont see that as a heavy lift for us we think thats more just bringing our expertise and the talents together the information is available to us we just need to formulate that information in the right way bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator your next question will come from the line of casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning followup on credit quality so following the review of some of the more troubled exposures in your loan book office multifamily and traditional cre just wondering what kind of price declines you guys came across as you built reserves just looking for some craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah it depends on the book but i would tell you that our reserving process contemplated price declines in office and 30ish range for multifamily thats the way weve modeled it if you think about ltvs thats why we see office is pretty stressed because our origination ltvs at puts us pretty close new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 on the multifamily book our origination ltvs were in the range our origination debt service coverage was in the 16plus coverage ratio level so if we think about current ltvs being in that multifamily book perhaps down as much as which is what weve modeled that puts the overall loan to value ratio potentially in the high low range and if you think about the resets and the rate level for resets depending on where we are in the rate curve and when those reset theyre sort of hovering in that to debt service coverage ratio which is why were not seeing a lot of defaults is because theyre able to cover the debt service theyre not making as much money as theyd like for owners but theyre able to cover the debt service casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks and then on slide you guys outlined your relative position versus cat iv banks one of the metrics not here is the cre concentration it sounds like you guys are your forecast is based on a flat balance sheet aside from the billion potential sale but a flat balance sheet with ci i think craig i think you mentioned a billion growth opportunity in ci longer term just wondering how does the cre concentration evolve in the coming years on a flat balance sheet craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc i think it evolves as we as we work through the refinance reset and maturity cycle over the next to years and retain the credits that we want where we have broader business relationships and allow the credits that are more balance sheet usefocused to run off the balance sheet then were able to have capital to deploy into these growing business opportunities joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and just a point of information it isnt like were saying the balance sheet is going to remain flat in our baseline case we had it flat and then the other attributes of asset sales winding down businesses could have obviously impacts to the size of the balance sheet so its just in the baseline case thats where its at but clearly were sitting here three years from now we would like to be looking down the path of a billion cre portfolio casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of jared shaw with barclays please go ahead joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi george sic jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good morning hi its actually jared shaw but just a quick question on liquidity expectations how should we be thinking about onbalance sheet liquidity and hqla in light of some of the guidance weve seen here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so onbalance sheet liquidity right now is ample as i pointed out we have quite a bit more onbalance sheet liquidity today than what we have in uninsured deposits as i mentioned to the extent that we do transactions i would expect that a good portion of that at least in the near term would be contingent on balance sheet liquidity i dont really expect to grow the securities portfolio substantially itll be pretty shortterm liquidity as i mentioned were pretty interest rate risk neutral right now im not sure i want to extend the duration very far out well take a look at it but were pretty interest rate risk neutral so we like it the balance of our liquidity mix jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then just two quick modeling questions do you have what the loan accretion was in the quarter and then when we look at the expense guide is that including intangible amortization craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc the expense guide is including intangible amortization i dont have the loan accretion jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks operator your next question will come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is actually janet lee on for steve alexopoulos back to your flat balance sheet comment earlier is it fair to say that overall deposits are basically saying flattish through at the billion level and in your nii outlook what is assumed for your noninterestbearing deposits to bottom out and can you share color and how that deposit indiscernible change from here for the remainder of craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi janet weve been pretty conservative from a forecasting standpoint weve assumed a flat mix to date we do expect that well see as joseph mentioned as we expand our relationships with these customers into deeper relationships we expect to see more demand deposit and transactional type funding and so theres the opportunity for upside in terms of our funding mix but in our base model that weve presented we havent included an optimistic outlook on that so to speak janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and as your cre loans are coming down to a billion range over the next few years can you give us more detailed time line on that and where do you expect your overall loan balances to be at towards the end of and whats a more normalized level of loan growth for you going forward in and new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so the portfolio assuming the forecasts that weve included does not really include a loan mix change in the outlook these are more think of them as strategic plans as opposed to forecasting but as we think about the potential as i mentioned we have about billion a year that will hit resets and maturities over the next three years and so you think about thats the kind of and the bulk of that is either multifamily or office indiscernible is multifamily so as we think about the opportunity its that kind of size is what is would be a natural opportunity to adjust concentrations over the next three years as opposed to portfolio sales and then as we think about loan growth we have a modeled substantial loan growth in the book here we kept the balance sheet relatively flat janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and my last question on credit besides the couple of office chargeoffs you had in the first quarter can you talk about how much of your rentregulated multifamily and cre loans that came due in and what happened to these loans how much got refinanced or paid off or were these given modifications and extensions craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well as i mentioned over the last months weve had billion that has reached our reset dates and a fourth of that has paid off and of that has refinanced and the performance has been really really strong im not going to say that we havent had any delinquencies theres probably one or two out there but its essentially no delinquencies todate on those loans that have reset at current rate levels and the first quarter performance is relatively similar i mean something that reset in the first quarter hasnt had much time to perform so i dont want to speak too hard on that but the overall characteristics of the first quarter werent any different than the previous months janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thanks for taking my questions craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of peter winter with d a davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning can you provide an update on the criticized and classified loans the trends this quarter craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 yeah so we did have about a little over billion of rating changes but criticized and classifieds im just taking a look a quick look here so criticized and classifieds increased about million from quartertoquarter thats a wrong number im sorry criticized and classifieds increased about billion from quartertoquarter and those are two of the ones that were looking at as we think about how changes in the interest rate curve impact them when they get to the reprice dates not all of those reprice in the near term but overall it was about a billion increase peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks and then just if i could just ask if i look at the average share count pretty much most people got it wrong in the first quarter just how should we think about the average share count in the second and third quarter craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah but i wouldnt say that people necessarily got it wrong its a confusing math story in part because the way were presenting in this deck is on a fully converted basis for the preferred stock so the transaction that we did in march had a good portion of that being preferred so we have million shares today and on an as converted basis will be over billion and we present the details of that in the materials but thats an expectation that those shares would convert in the second quarter and so all of our information has been presented as if those shares were fully converted throughout the forecast period peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi matthew matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey i was hoping you could talk about the potential sale and oneoff of nonstrategic assets beyond the identified billion areas youre focused on and the amount you deem nonstrategic and then in addition last quarter we discussed the cre concentration and the need to get that in line with category iv bank peers which is a new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 significant gap between where you are today im curious where you see that cre concentration going by year end with the rest of the guidance areas capital and profitability joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so matthew obviously were not in a position to comment on the billion so as i indicated we are close to being have the option of choosing that transaction so well be working on that over the next hours as far as like our process we really have been both craig and i have been here a relatively short period of time but going through sitting down with the business owners within the company and trying to understand the business weve had numerous meetings to kind of go through sit down and understand the business and make a determination where is it that we have relationships and so that has really given us the opportunity to kind of then come back and were going to put through a process where well build our strategic plan for the company and well be in a position to give you a better identification when we get together for the second quarter after weve had a little bit more time to kind of go through that and make some determinations of which are strategic assets and which are not matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then on the cre concentration where do you anticipate that being by yearend joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc where do i think what matthew matthew breese q analyst stephens inc the commercial real estate concentration joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i mean i think the commercial real estate concentration probably i think in an ideal world youre probably somewhere around to some type of consumerrelated probably in ci and probably in your cre we really see the growth potential in the ci based upon not only my experience but the talent that we will draw into the company matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then i didnt want to touch on capital how are you thinking about the warrants and timing on those being exercised or is that a longerterm item and then i wanted to touch on tlacrelated debt whether thats incorporated in your outlook craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc the answer is on tlac we have incorporated a significant amount of long term debt in this outlook with respect to the warrants the capital numbers that we include here do not include any capital that would cover the exercise new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 of the warrants they do include an allocation of a portion of the billion capital raise in march to the warrant classification but we havent included anything from an exercise price so theres potential upside from that matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then last one from me is how much in deposits are at the bank tied to signature of legacy specialized mortgage solutions team and then how sticky important is that business to you going forward craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well i think id focus on less on the signature and more on the mortgage banking aspect their business relationships that are part of either broader business activities or our mortgage model more so than the signature advisor so to speak its roughly about it varies because theyre mortgage escrow related so some of them move up and down with principal and interest in the cash flows associated with that but call it big round numbers billion or billion its not a big number for us matthew breese q analyst stephens inc ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc youre welcome joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve moss with raymond james please go ahead craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good morning maybe just going back to multifamily credit here i hear you guys with regard to rates seem to be influencing your expectation on credit costs should we think about the provision primarily being driven by loans resetting over the next to months and could that provision therefore be more elevated as we go through a larger set of resets over the next four to five years if we stay up at a to coupon on the fiveyear craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well i think weve focused our credit review based on where the market forecasts are from interest rates i mean certainly it could as i mentioned we have billion in the whole book that matures and that resets each year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 over the next three years if you get out into its about billion so youve got a bit of a bubble as you sort of take five years stuff out to so if you see rates stay this high that long but i think theres other issues that with that might foretell further the economy if we see rates that high that long steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then in terms of just the ability for a number of these borrowers who are in more aggressive structures to pay it sounds like you have some expectation of government subsidies whether its tax benefits or other programs just kind of curious how much maybe government programs are influencing your expectations on credit costs going forward and one other thing with regard to the coverage there just curious as to well ill stop there with that craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so id say that the government support hasnt really influenced our view on credit risk or reserving i think what were really speaking to more is not the government aspects but just simply the ownership aspects what types of owners how theyve invested what their historical investment path has been whether they have significant bases or small bases and the potential for tax implications to them if they were to exit versus continue to hold and support the debt joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and steve the thing i would add there is the owners of these properties will come in advices that they have are seeking tax abatement and we do not put that into our models under noi until craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc unless they have it until they get it joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well until they get it and so there have been some recent surprises that they were able to get those completed which were very positive for the properties steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc right okay i appreciate that and just two more for me in terms of craig you mentioned debt service coverage on the portfolio onesixth but i think when previous management was disclosing that it was on current payment terms does that debt service coverage ratio on current payment terms or full pi or even the interestonly loans craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so the number i gave you was on current payment terms and their existing contractual rates on full pi its call it basis points lower than that new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and the last one from me just curious here as to when the lockup expires for the investors in march craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc i dont know the answer to that question steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate all the color and time thank you very much thank you very much craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator our next question will come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey one for each of you craig for you on slide your numbers suggest maybe a modest loss from here through maybe breakeven i dont know but how should we think about the cadence of earnings in the very near term should we expect a second quarter loss and then profitability to build from there are you sending a different message there craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc no i think youre seeing the message jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so all right thats helpful and then joseph for you much bigger picture any major surprises for you on the deep dive and you raised billion based on what you know now is that enough or is it too much given what you know right new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 01may2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc no we think it was appropriate when we went through the due diligence process initially we had a smaller number and then it was concluded it needed to be north of billion so i think thats the right number when you look at kind of our cet1 the baseline that where we are today and how that grows we feel like we have sufficient liquidity and capital to execute the business plan jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and no real surprises from your point of view joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well i mean when you say surprises i wish the regulatory relationships were better at the organization we have a lot of work to do and thats on us that we as an organization in some regards were not ready to be regulated by the occ and so we have a lot of catching up to do to get our standards up but were committed to doing that and weve hired the people who understand what that looks like and i think part of the problem we had before was we didnt have people that could visualize the end game or work in a work environment that had that proper regulatory infrastructure so i would say that is kind of number one number two craig and i grew up where every unit in the bank of significance has their own personal financial statements and we do monthly reviews with them and were constantly forecasting out with those business units what their business is going to look like over a 12quarter basis that doesnt exist in this company i think culturally that will change a lot when we get that implemented that isnt a long term thing thatll be a relatively short thing well get done and then we can do a much more accurate job i think and influence the performance of the company by driving that through those businesses craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc itll make us more nimble joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and the other thing i would just add to that is when the infrastructure part of the company can spend money and the business units arent being allocated and we need to create a little tension between infrastructure and the lines where theyll be paying for it so theres a little bit of pushback and questioning the dollar amount that enhances i think our financial disciplines jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks guys good luck with all those craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected
