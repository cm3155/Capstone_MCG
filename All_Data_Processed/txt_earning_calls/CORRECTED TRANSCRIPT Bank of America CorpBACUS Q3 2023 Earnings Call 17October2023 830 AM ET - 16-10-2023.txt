america corp good morning everyone and thank you for joining us as usual were starting on slide our third quarter here at bank of america was another strong quarter as we delivered billion in net income that is a growth over the year ago third quarter and for the first nine months of the year we have earned billion an increase of over we grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace across all our businesses our operating leverage was about flat we improved our common equity tier ratio by nearly basis points in the quarter to a level of against a current minimum of we saw an increase in our deposits and we maintained our strong pricing discipline we continued to maintain billion in global liquidity sources we also delivered a good return for you our shareholders with a return on tangible common equity of over and a return on assets just a quick note of what we see in the economy our team of economists predicts a soft landing with a trough in the middle of next year we see that in our customer data our million checking customers we see their spending slowing down you can see that on slide the third quarter was up about over last years third quarter earlier this year that would have been more of a increase yearoveryear and for the entire year it increased round numbers over this level is consistent with the spending we saw in the prepandemic period from to that is consistent with the low inflation lower growth economy as we bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 move into october the spending is holding at that level so growing but growing at a base thats more consistent with low growth low inflation economy with that let me turn to slide we provide various highlights and alastair is going to cover a lot of this our team continues to focus on driving organic growth driving digital progress and operational excellence which keeps us focused on operating leverage a few words on organic growth as we flip to slide every business segment had organic growth in consumer in quarter three we opened more than net new checking accounts this quarter alone we also opened another million credit card accounts we have more investment accounts this year third quarter than we did last year in small business we have seen straight quarters of net new checking account growth weve also seen good small business loan growth and our loans are up from last year that was in this quarter our small business teammates extended billion in credit to small business in america alone in global wealth we added nearly net new relationships to the merrill and private banking franchises and our advisors opened more than new bank accounts for the third consecutive quarter fulfilling both investing and banking needs for those clients we also increased our number of advisors in the past year across our wealth spectrum in gwim and in consumer investments they have combined together billion in total net flows in our global banking team we added clients and increased the number of products per relationship year todate weve added new commercial and business banking clients that is more than we added in the full year last year even while activity is low the investment banking team continues to hold its number three position in the global markets we continue to see performance establish new records for our firm im going to cover that in a little more detail in a moment as you can move to slide you can see the digital adoption and engagement volumes continue to increase we lead the industry in digital banking and continue to provide the bestinclass disclosures you can find those disclosures by line of business in the appendix on slides and we also continue to receive top accolades from thirdparties around these capabilities most important these capabilities are valued by our clients and customers and allow us to grow with great expense leverage let me give you a few examples our consumer and merrill clients logged into our consumer banking app a record billion times this quarter even at this scale and stage of maturity of this operation logins are up doubledigits from the year prior customer use of erica continue to beat our expectations with almost million users up in the past months cashpro app signins with our business clients are up more than and we recently added the erica functionality to cashpro to help corporate clients benefit from that artificial intelligence likewise zelle usage continues to grow zelle transaction levels are up more than from last year and zelle is becoming a meaningful way our customers move money in fact customers now send money with zelle at twice the rate they write checks were nearing a period where the zelle transactions sent will exceed the combination of checks written and atm withdrawal transactions as you move across the lines of business on the slide the story is the same all these capabilities help us deliver faster safer and more efficiently and all of it gets strong customer client feedback when you put that together that helps us drive operating leverage and you can see it on slide we have a strong record of driving operating leverage in our company we drove operating leverage every quarter for nearly five years before the pandemic and again more recently weve had an eight quarter streak leading into this quarter we acknowledged to you this last quarter that operating leverage is going to be tough for a few quarters as we navigate through the trough of net interest income but as you can see on slide we managed to grow our revenue yearoveryear faster than expense in dollar terms this quarter even though the percentage change was basically flat now in january we told you wed manage our head count down to help make sure we got our expenses in line over the course of weve bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 seen moving from 2022s great resignation to a current level of a record low attrition in our company all that meant the team had to work harder to manage that head count down and they did it our head count is now down over ftes from a peak in january even with the addition of college grads this fall as a result youve seen expense decline from billion in quarter one to billion in quarter two to billion this quarter and by the way weve done this without special charges or large layoffs indiscernible in the fourth quarter excluding any fdic special assessment of course we expect to report billion in expenses in now interestingly the debt is up only around from fourth quarter of last year this is stronger expense guidance than we thought we could do earlier in the year and sets us up nicely for next year shifting gears lets focus on the balance sheet slide shows the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the third quarter we gave you this chart last quarter also in the upper left hand you can see the trend of total deposits we ended quarter three at trillion up from quarter two and better than industry results what you should also note is the cost of these deposits our team has rewarded customers with higher rates for their investment ph oriented cash reinitiated deposit growth and grown share all with superior mix and cost you will note that were now paying basis points allin for deposits which is up basis points from last quarter best that you remember two things when you think about the deposits the rate remains low relative to many because of the transactional nature of our deposit relationships with billion in noninterestbearing deposits and you can see in the upper right alone the low interest and no interest checking theres billion in consumer secondly remember the importance of spread against the quarters average fed funds rate this position is very advantaged compared to past cycles because the transactional accounts in the current cycle are a much higher mix of bank of americas deposits i would also add that while weve maintained discipline in deposit pricing weve paid competitive rates to customers with excess cash seeing higher yields across all the businesses if rates fall those particular products would see the rates come down also dropping into the business trends in consumer if you look at the top right chart you saw a billion decline note the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts and higher yielding nonchecking accounts you could also see the low levels of our more ratesensitive balance in consumer investments and cd balances broken out in total we have billion in consumer deposits in consumer alone this is billion more than we had pre pandemic the total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was basis points this remains very low driven by the high percentage of highquality transactional accounts most of the quarters rate increase is concentrated in cds and consumer investment deposits which are about of the deposits turning to wealth management balances were flat we saw a slowing in the previous quarterly trend of clients moving money from lower yielding sweep accounts into higher yielding preferred deposits and offbalance sheet products sweep balances were down by billion and replaced by new account generation ph deepening at the bottom right note the global banking deposits grew billion and have hovered around billion the past six quarters these are generally the transactional deposits of our commercial customers used to manage their cash flows noninterestbearing deposits were of deposits at the end of the quarter sticking with the balance sheet but moving to capital let me give you a few thoughts on the proposed capital rules as you are well aware our banking industry in the united states is the most highly capitalized and most profitable banking group in the world its a source of strength for our country and its economy the annual stress test now over dozen years old using everincreasingly harsher test scenarios have proven that capital is sufficient banks have proven to be a part of the solution during the more recent covid pandemic and the banking disruption in march this year if we add to our capital it will reduce our lending capacity to american business consumers and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 those tradeoffs are being debated but as far as the rules are concerned there are many parts of the rules that our industry doesnt agree with because of double counts or increased trading and market risk and were talking through those proposals and working and were hopeful theyll change but in any event they may not and if they dont how will they affect us if you go to slide you can show the expected impact as we interpret those proposed rules this assumes that theyre proposed today without any changes the proposed rules would inflate our riskweighted assets by about so if i apply the inflation against this quarters rwa of trillion that means if nothing else change in the rules wed end up with about billion more riskweighted assets the biggest increase in rwa would be a couple hundred billion dollars in operational rwa the next biggest category would be driven by a fourfold increase in the rwa against nonpubliclytraded equity exposures in our case that really is mostly about the tax advantaged investments in solar and wind looking at the capital to be held against the inflated rwa on the right side of the slide id remind you today that our minimum capital requirement is to hold in common equity tier but based on our gsib charges that are going to come into effect on january we move to so im going to use that as the requirement holding today means billion we finished the third quarter with billion so today we have more than billion excess capital now lets assume the proposed changes going through in full those proposed changes are phased in from the middle of to under the current proposal when those are fully phased in as we used to call basel fully phased in if you remember we would have a need for billion of total capital now if you look on the upper right hand side of the page youll see that today were at billion so we hold the required capital today and of course wed have to build a buffer to that throughout the implementation period but if you look at the bottom of the page you can see just in the last nine quarters the kind of capital generation this company has once we understand the final rules well of course have a chance to optimize our balance sheet and appropriately price assets to improve the return on tangible common equity now before i turn it over to alastair i just want to highlight one of the businesses that weve talked about over the many years thats our global markets business global markets represents of the companys yeartodate earnings and is one of the top capital markets platforms in the world its one of a handful of firms ph that can do when its due providing advice and execution in every major market around the world jim demare and the team who run the business asked us for an additional investment around four years ago and theyve grown this business with an intensity that clients have appreciated and rewarded us with more of their business this has produced strong revenue growth weve grown the balance sheet here but have done it efficiently thats allowed us to grow sales and trading revenue over the past months consistently and now stands higher than the average of the five years leading into the pandemic and the investment in the business and through effective cost management we also generated to returns on capital in this business this exceeds our cost of capital even as we continue to allocate more capital to the business returns are even larger if you combine it with the global banking business that many show the businesses combined because our corporate clients also take advantage of these industryleading business capabilities with that let me turn over the call to alastair to walk through the quarter alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 thanks brian and on slide we present the summary income statement im not going to spend a lot of time here because brian touched on this and the highlights that we show on slide for the quarter we generated billion in net income resulting in per diluted share both of those are up double digits from the third quarter of last year the yearoveryear revenue growth of was led by improvement in net interest income coupled with a strong increase in sales and trading results and that excludes dva and a increase in investment and brokerage revenue driven by our wealth management businesses expense for the quarter of billion included good discipline from our team which allowed us to reduce costs from the second quarter even as we continue our planned investments for marketing technology and physical presence buildouts including financial center openings and renovations asset quality remains stellar and provision expense for the quarter was billion that consisted of million of net chargeoffs and million of reserve build the provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge offs toward prepandemic levels and remains below historical levels our chargeoff rate was basis points thats basis points higher than the second quarter and still below the basis points we saw in the fourth quarter of and as a reminder that was a multidecade low 30day delinquencies also remain below their fourth quarter level lastly our tax rate this quarter was driven mostly by higherthanexpected volume of investment tax credit or itc deals for the rest of the year and we can expect other income in q4 will reflect seasonally higher renewables investment losses when these projects get placed into service okay lets turn to the balance sheet thats on slide and you can see it ended the quarter at trillion up billion from the second quarter so not a lot to note here the driver of the increase was a billion increase in availableforsale securities with cash levels so high we chose to reduce the cash and just put some of the money into shortterm t bills this quarter and those earn essentially the same rate as cash our cash remains high at billion in addition to the cash level change we saw another billion decline in holdtomaturity securities as those securities matured and paid down and as brian noted global excess liquidity sources remain strong at billion thats down very modestly from the second quarter and still remains approximately billion above our prepandemic fourth quarter level shareholders equity increased billion from the second quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders during the quarter we paid out billion in common dividends and we bought back billion in shares to offset our employee awards aoci was billion lower reflecting both a modest decline in the value of afs securities modestly impacting cet1 as well as a small change in cash flow hedges which doesnt impact the regulatory capital tangible book value per share is up yearoveryear turning to regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion from june and our cet1 ratio improved basis points to its now well above our current requirement as brian noted riskweighted assets declined modestly as loans and global markets rwa both moved lower our supplemental leverage ratio was versus the minimum requirement of which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains well above our requirements lcr ratios remain well above minimums for bac metrics and stronger at the bank level lets now focus on loans by looking at average balances on slide and loan growth slowed this quarter as a decline in demand for commercial borrowing more than offset our credit card growth so we saw that lower commercial demand and lower revolver utilization among higher funding costs and commercial balances were also impacted by term loan repayments due to borrowers accessing other capital market solutions focusing for a moment on average deposits and using slide given brians earlier comments ill just note the comparisons relative to prepandemic fourth quarter average deposits are up consumer is up with consumer checking up and you can see the other segment comparisons on the page bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 turning to slide lets extend the conversation weve been having over the course of the past couple quarters around management of our excess liquidity this slide serves as a reminder of the size of our highquality deposit book the magnitude of deposits we have in excess of those neededtofund loans and the way weve extracted the value of that excess to deliver value back to our shareholders the excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from billion prepandemic to a peak of trillion in the fall of and as you can see it remains high at billion today that trillion of excess liquidity has always included a balanced mix of cash availableforsale securities and securities we hold to maturity in late and into we concluded that additional stimulus was going to remain in client accounts for an extended period and we increased the hold tomaturity securities portion so we could lockin value from those deposits and we made these investments given the core nature of our customers deposits note the split of the shorter term investments in cash and availableforsale securities and then the longerterm holdtomaturity securities and ill just draw your attention to just how much cash we have above the actual level we need to run the company on the availableforsale we would just note the duration is less than six months as its mostly all short term treasuries and the combination of the cash and availableforsale securities represents about of the total noted on this page in the third quarter of to give us the balance were looking for and if we look at the holdtomaturity book it had grown from billion prepandemic peaking two years ago and now falling to just over billion currently that billion consists of about billion in treasuries those will mature in a little more than six years and about billion in mortgagebacked securities and a few billion in other the holdtomaturity securities peaked at billion and were now down billion from the peak and billion in the last quarter that billion decline from peak was all driven by the reduction of mortgages from billion to billion with less loan funding needs over the past several quarters the proceeds from security paydowns have been deployed into higheryielding cash and this mix shift has been happening at about a 300basis point spread benefit for these assets given the increased cash rates the combined cash and security yield has risen now to more than its up more than basis points since the peak size of the portfolio in the third quarter of and its risen faster than the rate paid on deposits in fact today its basis points above what we pay for deposits and remember also we have trillion of loans that are largely in floating rate in addition from a valuation perspective we did experience a decline in the valuation of the holdtomaturity book this quarter and thats in the context of mortgage rates reaching a twodecade high comparing the valuation change to the yearago period it worsened billion and over that same time period we grew regulatory capital by billion and hold global liquidity sources in excess of billion and importantly as we move to slide ill make one final comment here which is the improved nii over this investment period the net interest income excluding global markets which we disclose each quarter troughed in q3 at billion that compares to billion in the third quarter of or billion higher every quarter on a quarterly basis and that gives a sense of the entire balance sheet working together okay lets now turn our focus to nii performance over the past quarter and well talk about the path forward and im going to use slide for that on last quarters call we guided to expect q3 nii to be about billion to billion on an fte basis our third quarter performance turned out to be better than our guidance and on an fte basis nii was billion this quarter we expect q4 will be around billion fully taxableequivalent and that increases our fullyear year guidance for nii in versus to growth for the year we believe nii will hover around this expected fourth quarter billion level plus or minus in the first half of next year and then we anticipate modest growth in the second half of by the time we get to the fourth quarter of we believe we can see nii up low singledigits compared to the fourth quarter of the good news is we believe bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 nii will likely trough around the fourth quarter level of billion and begin to grow again in the middle of next year id note a few caveats around that forward view i just provided it includes an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and it includes rate cuts for the second half of it also includes an expectation of modest loan and deposit growth as we move into the second half of focusing again on this quarter billion nii was an increase of nearly million from the third quarter of or while our net interest yield improved basis points to the yearoveryear improvement was driven by higher interest rates and partially offset by lower deposit balances on a linked quarter comparison nii improved million from q2 that comes from the benefit of an extra day of interest a rate hike and higher global markets nii partially offset by increased deposit pricing and the net interest yield improved basis points turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis the plus basis point parallel shift at september was billion of expected nii benefit over the next months from our banking book and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast and of the sensitivity is driven by short rates the basis point down rate scenario was billion okay lets turn to expense and well use slide for the discussion previously highlighted that we guided you to a trend of sequential declines in our expense each quarter this year and we achieved that in q3 with our expense down million to billion additionally we expect the fourth quarter to go down another couple hundred million to billion excluding any fdic special assessment that would mean our fourth quarter expense of billion compared to the fourth quarter of would be up by only million or less than and were proud of that work by the team especially considering our regular fdic insurance expense alone increased by million quarterly starting in the first quarter of this year so without that we would be flat year overyear in q4 the decline this quarter from the second was driven by the reduction in litigation expense and lower head count offset somewhat by investments and inflationary costs our head count is down nearly from the second quarter to and that includes the addition of or so fulltime campus hires we brought into the company so thats good work by the team after we peaked at in january monthend and you can see the movement here across the past year at the bottom left of the slide as we look forward to next quarter wed add billion of expense for the proposed notice of special assessment from the fdic as a possibility absent that wed expect our fourth quarter billion expense target to more fully benefit from the third quarter head count reductions and that will allow expense to continue the decline experienced throughout the year so far all of that is going to set us up well for next year lets now turn to credit and well turn to slide net chargeoffs of million increased million from the second quarter the increase is driven by credit card losses as higher latestage delinquencies flow through to chargeoffs for context the credit card net chargeoff rate rose basis points to in q3 and it remains below the prepandemic rate in the fourth quarter of provision expense was billion in q3 and that included a million reserve build it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of during on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and our commercial portfolios and on consumer wed just note that we continue to see the asset quality metrics come off the bottom and for the most part they remain below historical averages and 90day consumer delinquencies still remain below the fourth quarter of as an example commercial net chargeoffs declined from the second quarter driven mostly by a reduction in office writedowns and as a reminder our cre credit exposure represents of total loans and that includes office exposure which represents less than of our loans weve been very intentional bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 around client selection and portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years and thats helped us to mitigate risk in this portfolio we continue to believe that the portfolio is wellpositioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions and in the appendix weve included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats we provided last quarter weve also included the historical perspective of our loan book derisking and our net chargeoffs and you can see all of those on slides and okay lets move on to the various lines of business and their results and im going to start on slide with consumer banking for the quarter consumer earned billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continue to invest for the future note that the top line revenue grew while expense rose reported earnings declined yearoveryear given credit costs continue to return to prepandemic level and we believe this understates the underlying success of the business in driving revenue and managing costs because ppnr grew year overyear much of the success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts as well as investment accounts and balances as brian noted earlier and expense reflects the continued investments by the business for their future growth moving to wealth management on slide we produced good results and we earned a little more than billion these results are down from last year due to a decline in nii from higher deposit costs which more than offset higher fees from asset management while lower this quarter nii of billion derives from a worldclass banking offering and it provides good balance in our revenue stream and a competitive advantage in the business for us as brian noted both merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and they produced solid assets under management flows of billion since the third quarter of last year reflecting good mix of new client money as well as our existing clients putting their money to work expense reflects continued investments in the business as we add financial advisors and capabilities from technology investments on slide you see the global banking results and this business produced very strong results with earnings of billion driven by yearoveryear growth in revenue to billion coupled with good expense management the business has produced solid operating leverage our gts or global treasury services business has been robust weve also seen a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment yearoveryear revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prior year ago period the companys overall investment banking fees were billion in q3 growing modestly over the prior year despite a pool that was down nearly and we held on to number three position given our performance provision expense reflected reserve release of million as certain troubled industries and credits outside of commercial real estate continued to have improved outlooks expense increased yearoveryear reflecting our continued investments in this business switching to global markets on slide the team had another strong quarter with earnings growing to billion driven by revenue growth of and im referring to results excluding dva as we normally do the continued themes of inflation geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe have continued to impact both bond and equity markets and as a result it was a quarter where we saw strong performance in our ficc trading businesses as well as a record third quarter in equities focusing on sales and trading exdva revenue improved yearoveryear to billion ficc improved and equities improved compared to the third quarter of last year and at billion thats a record third quarter for our equities teammates yearoveryear expense increased primarily driven by investments for people and technology finally on slide all other shows a profit of million so revenue improved from the second quarter driven by the absence of priorperiod debt security sale losses and availableforsale securities and partially offset by higher operating losses on tax credit investments in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 wind solar and affordable housing as i mentioned earlier our effective tax rate in the quarter was and that reflects a higher than expected volume of investment tax credits in which the value of the deals are recognized upfront we also had a small discrete benefit to tax expense from a state tax law change excluding renewable investments and any other discrete tax benefits our tax rate would have been and as we wrap up we expect our full year tax rate excluding discrete and special items such as the fdic special assessment we expect that full year tax rate should end up in the to range so to summarize we grew our earnings doubledigit yearoveryear we reported nii that was above our expectations and we increased our fullyear expectations weve managed costs aligned with our guidance and brought expenses down in every quarter so far this year and we expect to do that again in the fourth quarter we earned more than return on tangible common equity we returned billion in capital back to shareholders including a dividend increase and we built basis points of cet1 positioning us well for the proposed capital rules so all in all it was a strong quarter it was one where our teams executed well against responsible growth and with that david i think well open it up for the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi brian and alastair brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp hi there alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc brian can you come back to your thoughts you were talking about the consumer spending holding at right now obviously down from the very strong levels of a year two years ago when you look out and you mentioned how you guys are thinking the economy troughs in the middle of next year do you think you could hold that consumer spend do you think your consumers will hold that spending number or could it actually deteriorate from here brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp i think a couple things gerard one is theres obviously external events which could change the situation in the globe dramatically and so but given just a pathway that that kind of event doesnt take place youd think that the bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 rate theyre spending at now is consistent with a lower inflation so embedded in our teams indiscernible and the teams economic projections is a return of inflation to the target at the end of the rate structure comes down beginning in the middle of next year but still stays around at the end of and so given that the inflation is coming down the economy would still be growing and getting back towards trend growth i think it would hold steady and so its been pretty steady the month of august into september into october at this level and thats kind of just people get paid more they spend a little bit more pricing goes up and then you have the ebbs and flows within it what they spend on and right now youve kind of seen all of the adjustments that came through the pandemic into the last couple years sort of adjust out of the system what i mean by that is you have a lot of goods purchased then you had a lot of travel you had a lot of return to office spending we can track that people buying stuff all thats kind of levelled out of the system including a drop in fuel prices and an increase and basically its relatively bouncing around about the same and theyre spending about the same amount of money on gas that they spent last year so all that being said in the big aggregate numbers i think yes it can keep bumping along at that level which is consistent with low inflation low growth economy and effectively shows the consumer has been brought more in line with the scenario of the fed reaching their target thats what we see now itll take some time for all that to work through the system and the retail sales number seems to be stronger today but that all shakes through but this is what theyre doing at the moment gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question you guys give us good detail on slide about the potential changes coming from basel iii endgame and you show us obviously the organic capital generation can you share with us possibly some of the mitigation strategies you might use and specifically if you could touch upon these changes for the equity investments particularly in the alternative energy space i guess theyre going up from rwas to would that change your thinking in that line of business as we go forward should they stay in the final rules brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so i think number one i think the first thing is at the end of november the comments are due therell be comments by our company by all the other companies by industry participants and then the staff at the fed will have to sort through all that and think what they all mean and therell be very rigorous points about our views of the wisdom of the changes the need of the changes the balance of the changes the doublecounting all the things that youve heard much about that being said it is a little puzzling that you see some of the rwa increases for mortgage loans or for these types of investments in the environmental and housing and other spaces which is sort of counter to the policy that we want to do it now what would happen is wed have to adjust the pricing and it would become more expensive its been a great business for us we continue to drive it but ultimately itd have to go through the market if you have the equity cost go up by a fourfold increase to get the returns and so think about a pricing model just increase the amount of equity we have to dedicate therefore we have to get returns on that and so that would happen it just seems a little counterintuitive that people would be doing that on a set of rules that basically after the financial crisis doddfrank put in a set of rules and said heres how you count the rwa without much evidence that this is an issue for companies because the volcker rule and all the other stuff that are having issues of writedowns or changes here and so the idea of going up four times seems odd to us from a public policy standpoint and also absent any evidence that this is an issue for the banking system bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you very much brian operator well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead your line is open james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey great good morning alastair at a conference a month ago you noted that if the fed is done you think deposit pricing is close to its peak and i think you kind of talked us through that a little bit today some of your peers have been more fearful of a potential future material repricing in consumer savings for example from greater competition or further outflows and to be fair theyve worried about that for a while and youve been more right but can you just kind of discuss your thoughts on that and perhaps the outlook on deposit pricing in general alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean jim one of the things that i think gives us some confidence around nii troughing and then growing in the back half of next year is if you think weve seen the last fed hike or you believe that the last fed hike is a month from now or two months from now then at some point deposit pricing is going to stop going up and therell be a natural lag to that thats pretty normal and then what you see if you look forward into the forward curve is weve actually got fed cuts three of them in the forward curve for next year so yes we anticipate there will be some lag i dont think were any different than anyone else in that regard but were just pointing out that as we get towards peak rates were getting closer now so we can begin to see the end of that in terms of the later innings at this point and the other thing just we always have to remind everyone of this is the deposits that we have are very relationshipbased a lot of them are core operating deposits where weve got the checking theyre thinking about the way we serve them in terms of digital weve got preferred rewards program and then on the commercial side very similar weve got a lot of operating deposits all around the world and theyre using our worldclass cashpro product so theres a lot of relationship value here as well that we need to take into account but fundamentally were just making a judgment that were getting towards the top of the rate cycle here for fed funds and then deposit pricing will sort out in a quarter or two following james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right thats fair maybe given the thoughts that theres three rate cuts in the forward curve and you are asset sensitive but yet you still expect growth or improving growth in nii in the back half is that just sort of the lag effect there too or is there something else going on in terms of rate cuts and the impact alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i think the other things that weve got going on especially as we get into the back half of the year consumer balances are going to find a floor at some point they again are in the late innings of returning to sort of more normal prepandemic balances per account so theyre going to find a floor and at that point theyre going bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 to start growing in the same way that wealth has found a floor and in the same way that global banking found a floor a while ago and is now beginning to grow so we have a point of view that the consumer side is going to find a floor so thats one two is at that point youre poised for deposit growth but were also going to see loan growth through the course of the year its been slower this quarter but at some point you return to a more normal economy as brian has pointed out were going to see the loan growth and so were thinking thats going to start to evidence itself in the back half and then the final thing id just say is we have securities reinvestment every month and thats going to support and grow nii and i think it gives us a sense that weve got a more durable nii stream underneath james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc great thats all very helpful thanks operator well take our next question from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i have my first question is sort of a twoprong on the balance sheet alastair if you could tell us sort of how much in cash flow do you forecast your htm book will have in as you think about the moving pieces underneath your nii outlook and for brian clearly this heldtomaturity portfolio has been a thorn in the side of the stock and no matter what we say to the investment community the stock hasnt quite caught up and im wondering as you think about the statistics that you share with us every quarter like netnew checking adds maybe give us a little more statistics in terms of the strength of that growth and the strength of that retention because i think that no matter what sort of print that you have on total deposits at the end of the quarter theres always sort of pushback so long as the market is not yet confident that weve hit peak rates so sort of a twopart first question alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp right so ill answer the first part erika i think if you look back through the course of the last couple of years that portfolio paydowns in terms of maturities or paydowns its sort of averaging billion a quarter so i think you could probably use that as a good starting point for the reinvestment horizon in thats what i would use and then ill let brian answer the second part of your question brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so erika we drive an organic growth machine based on a ph responsible set across all the different operating businesses so as you noted if you look at whats driving our deposit base to be larger than the industry ie outperform the industry is if you think from every comparison against to now and were up billion in consumer deposits alone we also are up probably in checking accounts net checking accounts those are core the attrition rate where all the deposit balances are in the preferred part of that segment the retention rate is 99plus longterm customers the preferred rewards program drives a basis on cards were now getting the balances back up to where they were prepandemic with even better credit quality than we had then we got home equities hit a trough and are starting to work their way out auto loans are starting we continue to produce a lot bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 the markets not real strong but it continues to produce several billion a quarter so all the organic growth engines in the consumer business are very strong when you go to the wealth management were now producing net household growth at a faster rate than we produced in the prior years if you go to the commercial banking businesses in the us we noted that we produced more customers this year and that deposit base those business banking and middle market segments those come with a big deposit franchise and you see that those deposits have actually been stable and growing for the last six months so the organic growth engine is in fine shape and just powers through all this and is the strength of the 3trillionplus balance sheet and in fact is the reason that we have billion on a given day that we have to put to work because youre just having this great engine go on and so whether its investment accounts in consumer checking accounts in consumer cards in consumer home equity all that has grown organically dramatically over the last years and frankly the loan growth will continue to follow that as conditions improve and then on commercial side as people go back to regular line usage we saw it deteriorate this quarter largely due to the demand side and so we feel very good and then we talked about the markets business gave you the detail there and the investment banking team is gaining market share and actually fought to maintain relatively flat fees in a market that was down or something so we feel very good about the organic growth engine thats what powers our company and that delivered billion plus in aftertax income for another quarter and return on tangible common equity erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for you alastair do you have any economic ownership of visa class b shares remaining our understanding is until the litigation was settled you werent allowed to sell it other than to other banks in the initial consortium but im wondering if youve sold any economic ownership through swap or if you still have it on the books because we havent seen any disclosures on that recently alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i mean we essentially sold and hedged our visa b position years ago and then in our markets business weve financed the sale of visa by other banks you can think about that as a hedge thing thats just about a financing so depending on how that all develops and what other banks choose to do we may end up having some rwa or some liquidity that we can recycle for other clients benefit in our markets business but we dont have any meaningful economic stake in visa b erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi do you expect the efficiency ratio expenses to revenues to improve from and when and i guess this is a twopart question one is expenses as you said its down every quarter this year and youre guiding for the fourth quarter slide the digital adoption its about ph threefourths for your clients across the firm so the sustainability of those digital trends to help lower expenses or control expenses given some of the headwinds and especially given the threat of big tech and fintech sustainability of the digital trends and why you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 think you have an advantage when some of the others think they have the advantage and the second part of that question is revenues your nim is a bit over went up a little quarteroverquarter but it was closer to going back five years and maybe long term it should be im not sure so what do you think is the normalized nim because that would help the efficiency ratio and the trend for expenses and ultimately the efficiency ratio thanks brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp sure so mike i think the expenses come down revenue grows the efficiency ratio continues to improve one of the big differences between us and other companies you can compare us to is the size of our wealth management business relative to the size of the company is large and as you know thats a business which we continue to work to make more efficient but is the least efficient business in the platform so lindsay and eric continue to drive the efficiency there so yes we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to improve and part of that will be as the net interest margin normalize that we normalize the size of the balance sheet given its grossed up for a lot of reasons through the pandemic and stuff and you kind of finetune it youll get a little more effectiveness there and in the past we ran up to nim in the sort of a normalized sort of environments and youd expect us to keep moving up from there and itll be bouncing around here as we work through the trough in nii that we described which is were sort of in the middle of starting this quarter into the first half of next year so mike and as you know its all about managing heads and thats last year at this time we were all talking about the great resignation or last year last summer and how we had to hire people and we overhired because the issue was could you hire fast enough to get what you needed this year were able to bring that excess back out of the system and ended up kind of where we wanted to be at the as we think forward we continue to reposition people around the company who are freed up because of that digital application to other things so in the broad sense our consumer business is down from people to people and continues to drift down as we continue to use the thats the place with the most leverage in digital across the board you continue to get less branches less atms you can see the statistics in the chart more customer interactions and more customers thats a pretty good trade and we continue to drive that including sales in digital that we disclose in the back of things were running nearly half the sales and frankly with improvements on the checking account opening we can drive another round of growth there so thats what were going to do continue to drive the efficiency ratio to level and well see where we can get it to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just on that big picture question i mean youve invested for over a decade in your data and tech stack and digital engagement and now we have ai and genai as a opportunity and a threat why do you think or maybe you dont why do you think that you have an advantage versus say smaller banks fintechs or big tech brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp well we have an advantage in that weve been applying it for a number of years now so effectively erica is a form of that and now has million customers working on everything and so think about that this quarter i think theres million interactions or whatever the number is million interactions something like that if you think about that mike in the days gone by every one of those would have been an email a text or a phone call and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 so its obviously tremendously more efficient and were continuing to prove it we brought it out to the cashpro side which is the commercial side so that helps if you think about in the billion well spend in on technology initiative spending aditya and the team continue to use the techniques that you read about in the paper to increase the efficiencies of that development effort and its probably in the short term building up higher and higher as people get more and more used to it and thatll allow those dollars to be stretched even further so we think thats a nearterm application that were already doing and has high probability and then frankly if you think about our capabilities if you look we have nearly i dont know patents out there or on ai already machine learningrelated activities sitting in the application filed weve got a lot of inventors in this company and so we feel good about our ability to compete against the types of people you said but by the way we use some of those people who might compete to actually be providers to help us do this stuff and some of the big tech companies are as you listen to them its a business for them to sell that ai capabilities to companies like ours to make us more efficient so nearterm customer health nearterm employee effectiveness nearterm coding enhancements et cetera et cetera but one of the things you mentioned is we have invested heavily to have the data and the tech stack ready to go and threepoint whatever billion dollars billion interactions this quarter digital show that people are ready to use the services we provide them mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning brian good morning alastair alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question on expense you cited head count actions that should provide relief in and positive flowthrough into next year was hoping you could either help size the benefit from expense actions or just frame how we should be thinking about expense growth as we look out to next year alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think what weve tried to do this year steve is communicate pretty clearly what our plan was as brian said we overachieved last year on hiring so we started the year with and expense of billion and weve really been working on the trajectory over the course of this year so this point of getting the head count to a place were comfortable billion turns into billion turns into billion were now determined to bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 deliver on the billion and i think thats going to set us up really well so our plan is to finalize our strategic planning over the course of the next few weeks and i think well give you more guidance next quarter steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great and just two clarifying questions or cleanup questions on my end on the nii remarks you talked about deposits i was hoping you could help frame alastair what are the assumptions youre making in terms of reinvestment yields and loan growth that are underpinning that higher nii exit rate for next year alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so id say reinvestment just assume the forward curve and with respect to loan growth id use low single digits consistent with the slow growth economy steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay and just one quick one here on the taxadvantaged investments i just wanted to confirm given the long duration the increase in capital are you still planning to fund taxadvantaged investments on the platform before the rules are finalized or are you going to take a waitandsee approach alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i mean this remains something thats important for our clients weve yet to see a final rule so well be supporting transactions but obviously as brian said it is informing us with respect to pricing and its informing us with respect to appetite but until theres a change well continue to support the clients in that regard steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood thanks so much for taking my questions operator well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning first just to clarify whats driving the drop in net interest income from to is that core net interest income or is that on the market side alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well youre talking about the fact that we think that were going to be around 14orso billion in q4 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc exactly bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp id say first one is youve got a little bit of deposit pricing lag there so we got to keep thinking about that second is were sort of baking into it some continued normalization of consumer balances so thats just continued to drift slowly lower i think third if we had hoped for loan growth in q3 we just didnt see that so thats going to flow through with lower loan growth balances in q4 and the only final thing id just say is the global markets nii may not repeat in quite the same way some of that depends on client behavior and they benefited this particular quarter by just longterm rates going up so significantly and that helping the carry side so its all those things and probably a little bit of rate hike probability or timing delay but its all those sorts of things more importantly it hasnt changed from our expectation a quarter ago in any way matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay thats helpful and then just conceptually as we think about your net interest income guidance for next year what if we get higher for longer rates theres not cuts is that good or bad versus the guidance that you gave earlier obviously youve got puts and takes so some reinvestment on the asset side but again coming back to the deposit pricing issue i think theres a view that higher for longer eventually drives up those consumer rates so what would be the net of those two in the higher for longer thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well higher for longer is going to be better so youre right weve got the forward curve in our expectations if that doesnt turn out to be the case wed expect nii would be higher matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and thats simply the assets youre pricing more on the deposits or youre still thinking theres minimal consumer deposit or pricing even in the higher for longer alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp itll be both i mean therell be the repricing for sure and in addition wed expect to capture a little bit of margin from any shortterm rate hike matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay understood thank you operator well take our next question from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead your line is open john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah i was hoping you could give a little color on what youre seeing on credit your outlook as you look at roll rates and migrations how are you thinking about the trajectory of chargeoffs in the near term bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well john id just point out as you can see the trajectory weve laid it out on the slide most all of the net charge off increase over time has been really due to card and consumer card and the chargeoffs at this point are still lower than they were in the fourth quarter of which was a stellar period and id anticipate in the short term that youd see things begin to well just continue that trend because it normally follows 90days past due delinquencies and those are up ever so slightly again this quarter so were inching closer to the fourth quarter of and at some point thats going to begin to stabilize from there its just a question of what does the economy do so right now as brians pointed out weve got a slow growth economy in the plan so id anticipate as we get back towards that kind of fourth quarter number its going to normalize in there but from that point on it will be very economic dependent on the commercial side the asset quality has been excellent and the only place where weve got particular elevated concern is office which is a very small part of our portfolio its less than of our loans but the commercial side has been terrific and again that will depend on how the economy plays out and whether were talking about a soft landing whether were talking about a recession or whether were talking about robust growth so all of thats going to have to play itself out with the commercial numbers being so low that one could bounce around a little bit but its only because its coming off a base thats so low at this point brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp john just one thing on as you think about the commercial credit remember we have a strong disciplined ratings change ratings capability in this company and so we are pushing through the reviews of the commercial real estate portfolio et cetera we put them on criticize quickly we deal with the chargeoffs and thats why youve seen it come back down already and were adjusting those activities as we show in the slides in the part of the deck to current appraisals under current market conditions under current rent rolls et cetera so even though its a very small part of our portfolio frankly a lot of the issues are through the system for us because the high ratings integrity and ratings conservatism weve had in this company for many many years and that holds us well and id always remind if you think back like in the oil and gas thing in the end of we put up all of this reserve that was prececl and then ended up bringing it back in because the chargeoffs were very modest so i think we feel very good about the original underwriting but you also have because of our ratings integrity on the office part of the portfolio we pushed a fairly significant amount through reappraisal and relook and we had the cecl reserves but importantly the chargeoffs are falling already john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp got it and one bigger picture question as you think about the basel iii and the opportunity to mitigate and optimize does a rotce feel like a good aspiration for the company over time brian through the cycle i mean im recognizing thats where you are already today but as you factor in the potential for new rules how do you think about that brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so i think the simple way to think about it is if were doing it on billion of capital which we did at this quarter and you need about another say billion to put a buffer on the end state need billion billion bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 billion plus which is our normal buffer without any mitigation that would be a very modest increase of billion over billion lets make it simple and that would hit the rotce a bit and im sure we can figure out ways to price to get that back but remember were different than everybody else john because were actually sitting on this amount of capital today and so we are getting a return on it so dont take that as saying i agree with the rules but saying weve got to deal with the cards that are dealt to us the rules say that you have to have billion plus about billion cushion and maybe a little bit more cushion but depending on for basis points or so but were doing today so thatd be a slight dilution to that number but not something we couldnt make up and thats before any mitigation on us and there is always mitigation you know that youve been around this industry for a long time so theres always mitigation in how you construct things what youll do what youll not do and i fully expect therell be modifications in the rules which ought to help also but i think the simple point is we earned it on that amount of capital today so its not like some calculation i have to think through its right there today john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah thats good perspective thanks brian operator well take our next question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks alastair question just want to clarify your nii comment so if rates stay higher or better are you implying that rate cuts would therefore be negative for you from an nii standpoint alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah im saying right now vivek that if you think about what rate cuts look like in the back half of next year in the absence of that we might guide nii higher yes thats what im trying to communicate vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and is that because you have that many floating rate assets that will reprice faster than you can cut funding costs alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah on the way down id anticipate that as rates are going down its going to cut into our margin on our deposit spreads so thats essentially what were talking about brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah vivek im just listening to you and alastair i think remember the forward curve has multiple cuts in it next year and i think the question earlier was if those didnt occur what would happen and i think alastair said nii bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 would be higher if those cuts didnt occur its not a rate that just mathematically thats basis points in the second half of next year of not being cut would hold us higher because of all the deposits being worth more and the floating rate assets holding pricing up better dominant part of our balance sheet i just sensed that you were talking by each other but maybe not vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks operator well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you just a followup on the securities portfolio on the afs side alastair how much of that billion is still swapped and can you kind of help us understand like what the kind of allin yield is on that book and if you would still also have repricing help going forward on that book as well as you had mentioned earlier on the htm maturities alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so most of the book we swapped to floating and weve tried to establish that over the course of time so you can almost think about most all of the availableforsale securities repricing kind of every day every week every two weeks whatever it may be so that tends to look a little bit more like the cashtype moves over time theres a few securities in there that are fixed rate but very little in terms of the total complexion ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay that helps thank you and then just wanted to also say on the fee side obviously another really good job both on the investment bank and the trading businesses still an uncertain environment just wanted to get your thoughts you were able to hold ib fees flat sequentially which was i think better than you had indicated just your thoughts on reopening here in the markets and how youre kind of expecting the business to hopefully act albeit understanding its still an uncertain environment alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so this is i suppose unusual and not unusual investment banking obviously has the potential for swings in fees and whats interesting about this one is weve now been bouncing around this sort of billion per quarter billion per quarter and normally investment banking youd expect to return within a year or so and were now seven quarters into this so weve got a good pipeline and mostly what i think corporate america and around the world csuite executives are looking for is the confidence that comes from macroeconomic certainty geopolitical certainty so for as long as weve got the volatility its going to stay in this kind of a range but if you were to look back in periods past investment banking can come back very very quickly to a more historical range of kind of billion billion billion per quarter its just that weve grown tired of predicting when that might be ken bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah ken let me give you two other pieces one the pipeline still is strong but more importantly matthew and the team have done a good job of building out our capabilities to serve our huge middle market client base or global commercial banking client base under wendys leadership and that number is growing quickly and thats a market which were relatively unpenetrated in we had good market share with our clients that we did business with meaning investment banking business with and so thats generating probably better performance for us than others in terms of holding our position flat relative to up a little bit yearoveryear flat yearoveryear versus a down market so we basically doubled the size of that team and well double it again its that kind of opportunity for us ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great thank you for the color operator well take our next question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning my question was around deposit growth and what level of deposit growth you think you need from here should it be in line with loan growth or are you happy to let some of the more maybe nontransaction deposits run off and the reason i ask is because as noted in some of the prior questions some of your peers are saying that theres more room for consumer deposits to reprice higher especially core checking accounts it sort of sounds like you disagree with that so wanted to assess how much you might need to respond if competitors act differently brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so a couple things one just broadbased we have trillion in deposits and trillion of loans so we have a tremendously high deposit base but also if you look at the slide or whatever it is we show the deposits by business in the banking business global banking i think six quarters weve been relatively flat and starting to grow off of that that is fully priced its not like corporate treasurers wait around to talk to you about what youre paying and in a noninterestbearing percentage that has drifted down the amount they hold in excess of that part of that to pay fees has been relatively stable and so we feel very good about that you look at wealth management basically all the movement has been made pretty much to the higherrate environment ie buying treasury securities directly if you look in our wealth management business the amount of shortterm cash orientedtype investments money market funds and et cetera treasuries et cetera its gone from like billion to billion or billion over the last couple years so that move has taken place and so the rest of it is now in a relatively stable base and you can see those numbers flattening if you go to the consumer side theres basically two or three things one is in the more medium income households plus or minus youre seeing the slow spenddown even though you still have multiples of what they had prepandemic in their accounts and even though thats a small part of the overall deposit base theres still the slow trend where thats drifting down as all the things you read about go on in the higherend part of that base in the broad consumer base theyre actually below the pandemic by about and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 thats because they moved the money into the market and you can see that in some of the preferred category pricing so where people think about checking and money markets and this i always have thought about it a little more straightforward which is transactional cash and investment cash the investment cash has largely been resuited across the businesses the transactional cash holds because its money in motion moving every day and for our consumer business thats represented by the trillion of checking account balances you can see on the page with some modest amounts in money markets and stuff that are carried as the cushion people have and if they moved the money to market theyve moved it and so were watching consumer because theres a little more drifting there and its up billion since prepandemic and youre saying you have the dynamics of loans student loan repayments starting thats million of our customers pay student loans you have the dynamics of interest rate impacts on cash carry of loan balance thats higher and thatll sort out but just takes a lot longer thats across million people so the impact takes a while to sort through and so we feel good about it but i think people are looking by category and this and that you have to think about it more how a customer whether its a business or a consumer behaves and what weve seen them is adjust their behavior based on their household circumstances and largely through the system and most of it coming a little bit slower in consumer just because the natural question if theres lot of stimulus went in those accounts what do i do with it over time and now theyre doing something with it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thats helpful detail so i guess just in terms of deposit growth from here would you still prefer to grow deposits in line with loans or is there a little bit more room for that to come down brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp we prefer to grow deposits in line with customer growth and activity so in the last four quarters in consumer i think were up another net new checking accounts which average balance is around they come in at lower than that and mature up to that we have a transactional banking business for all types of customers and we grow it irrespective of it that produces trillion you have a loan business to customers that produces trillion and that difference then is a wonderful thing to have every day manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate it thank you operator well take our next question from chris kotowski with oppenheimer please go ahead your line is open chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning thanks i have been looking at your average balance sheet on page of the supplement and i noticed that in this quarter your overall yield on earning assets was up basis points and lo and behold the yield on interestbearing liabilities was also up basis points and im curious was there some benefit unusual the lower amortization or something like that or is it just a function of that behind all the moving parts the balance is better than youd thought bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i dont think it was an amortization issue i think it was just the way the entire balance sheet works across assets liabilities when you think about all the various moving pieces so i dont think theres anything particularly notable there chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay no its just stunning with all the moving pieces how the earning asset yield and the liability yields really moved in tandem all right thats it for me thank you operator for our final question today we have a followup from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks brian trading has grown nicely and equities you said it was led by financing is there room in your balance sheet from a capital standpoint to keep growing that and second question related to trading would be in your guidance on nii for next year what are you assuming for trading nii in there brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp let me just hit the first one and alastair hit the second one the capacity if you think about the constraint on rwa as you know vivek in your experience in the business that equity financing is not rwa intense but it is sizeintense when you look at us with our cet leverage ratio 100plus basis points over the requirements we have lots of room on the asset size if we want and the return on equity and the return on the risk in that business is very strong so jim and the team have done a good job and indiscernible on the equities side and we continue to experience so theres plenty of room and in fact we have brought the balance sheet up by over billion largely due to the financing side and a lot of that due to equities and we can continue to do that if the clients need the capabilities and products so thats the simple answer yes theres a lot of capacity and largely driven by our huge capital base and on all the size measures were way over the requirements i think basis points on that is probably almost billion of overage so you have a lot of room to go alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and then vivek in terms of the nii guidance we include global markets in there so its just part of a big diversified portfolio i think we would point to global markets remains liabilitysensitive you can see that in the way nii has come down in and and into with rates going up so itll perform according to the rate curve and then we may put a little bit of modest balance sheet growth in there as brian pointed out just to continue investing in the business but its in the nii guide and it will follow the forward curve vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2023 brian t moynihan chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so thank you for joining us just in closing id go back to the key points strong earnings for the company earnings growth yearoveryear for
