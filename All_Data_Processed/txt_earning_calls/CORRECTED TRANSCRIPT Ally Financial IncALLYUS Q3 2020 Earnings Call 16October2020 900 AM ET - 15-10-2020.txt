difficult q2 allys new origination yields of represented another quarter of disciplined underwriting and combined with net chargeoffs of basis points drove expanded riskadjusted returns this was the lowest third quarter loss level for ally since when our portfolio consisted mainly of new subvented loans generally speaking the us consumer entered on solid footing and it demonstrated a higher degree of resiliency despite significant and ongoing challenges aided by meaningful and necessary fiscal stimulus while recent trends suggest a broader recovery is underway in various pockets of the economy were mindful of the currently expired stimulus benefits and the ongoing uncertainty around the outlook of covid unemployment levels remain above prepandemic levels labor participation has declined and recent layoff announcements have picked up across harder hit travel and entertainment industries the growing disparate impact being felt across educational income and racial backgrounds

balanced were proud to continue serving our customers including actions weve taken to keep them in their cars and homes our deferral program serves as a realtime example of this where our higher than

results jennifer laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb and good morning everyone lets jump in first on some of our key operating metrics ill begin on slide with a review of monthly trends in our auto segment consumer application and origination momentum continued this quarter reflecting our adaptable business model dealer resilience and stronger than anticipated consumer demand the recovery and sales from the trough in april has been driven by a combination of three factors including a shift toward personnel vehicle ownership replacing mass transit and ridesharing where usage has declined to from precovid levels the utility provided by owning a car including the added flexibility and control in an uncertain covid environment and an increased consumer propensity to purchase a car as spending on entertainment and travel has been reduced as these sudden and meaningful consumer shifts have unfolded weve remained a focused and dependable partner for our dealers rapidly expanding our market reach evidenced by the increased loan purchase program we announced with carvana last month and the dynamic and evolving support for emerging and more traditional dealers weve continued to be mindful of the credit environment and have managed an effective and dynamic underwriting approach in the bottom left used car gain per vehicle averaged over the highest level in seven years leading to the highest quarterly gains in five years we now expect full year used car values to rise by more than yearoveryear benefiting nii and net chargeoffs moving into we expect used vehicle values to decline modestly though steady demand and low new vehicle inventories will continue to be a tailwind longerterm commercial balances shown in the bottom right grew in august and september following the trough in july as oem production levels have largely normalized we expect balances to slowly rebuild through the latter part of next year lets turn to slide to review consumer product trends momentum and progress among our digitally based consumer offerings continued in q3 retail deposit balances and customer growth reached their highest third quarter levels for ally balances expanded despite record tax outflows as payment deadlines were delayed into ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 q3 and our customer base expanded every month this quarter reflecting the appeal of our award winning offerings directtoconsumer mortgage originations reached billion in the quarter elevated trading activity continued at invest with customer assets ending the quarter at billion growth in both channels continues to be sourced from existing customers with of new brokerage account openings and of mortgage originations coming from existing ally customers these metrics reflect our large organic growth opportunity as customers continue to seek ways to expand their ally relationships slide includes a snapshot of key balance sheet metrics weve taken deliberate actions over the past several years to strengthen our balance sheet allowing us to focus on executing for our customers in this challenging environment liquidity levels remained strong and our evolving funding profile continues to provide opportunities to lower our cost of funds and patiently deploy liquidity capital levels remained well above regulatory minimums and reserve levels ensure were prepared for a variety of potential credit outcomes while many unknowns remain around the full extent and ongoing impacts related to covid we have confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and our proven ability to navigate lets move to slide to review detailed financial results for the quarter net financing revenue excluding oid of billion grew million linkedquarter and million yearoveryear this represents our highest quarterly results and more importantly resumes our trajectory of nii and nim expansion powered by the combination of stable earning asset yields from retail auto yield expansion lease gains and a wellpositioned investment security portfolio declining cost of funds as we continue optimizing the deposit portfolio and reducing higher cost funding and steady loan growth these dynamics uniquely position us to overcome headwinds associated with lower rates elevated prepayments and negative carry from excess liquidity other revenue of million reflected strong realized investment gains and robust mortgage fee income within this line item is a charge related to the early pay down of certain fhlb debt an action that reduces excess liquidity and accelerates nim as we replaced debt with low cost deposits entering other revenue was projected to generate approximately million per quarter reflecting growing insurance mortgage and smartauction results weve generated meaningfully higher income this year from strong investment activity reinforcing our ability to generate diversified revenue provision expense of million was materially lower linkedquarter and yearoveryear driven by improved frequency and severity across consumer portfolios and stable strong commercial performance noninterest expense declined seasonally million quarteroverquarter and increased million yearover year driven by recurring themes including revenuerelated business expenses and volumedriven costs of our growing customer base investments in technologyrelated items and higher insurance expenses where we experienced a more active q3 weather season were continuously working to identify and reduce spend across nonessential areas while also investing in our businesses to fuel revenue and customer growth key metrics at the bottom reflect a solid performance generated across our company during the quarter slide includes balance sheet and nim results net interest margin excluding oid of expanded quarter overquarter reflecting embedded dynamics i just reviewed where retail auto portfolio expansion strong lease gains and deposit cost improvement drove margin expansion despite nim pressure from premium amortization and excess liquidity average earning assets expanded quarteroverquarter to billion driven by consumer auto and cash offsetting the impact of lower commercial balances and elevated mortgage prepayment activity retail auto ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 portfolio yield excluding hedge impacts expanded basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points year overyear average commercial auto balances declined billion quarteroverquarter though expansion occurred in august and september cost of funds improved basis points the fifth consecutive quarteroverquarter decline a trend we expect to continue over the next several quarters these fundamental drivers will propel ongoing nim expansion paving a path to as we move through detailed deposit trends are on slide total deposits grew to billion as retail balances expanded to billion compared to billion a year ago customer retention measured as those who maintain an account with us over time remains strong at demonstrating consistent loyalty and engagement on the bottom right we ended the quarter with over million customers growing at the highest level for a third quarter ever in the bottom left retail portfolio rates declined basis points linkedquarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting disciplined pricing action and a shift to liquid products and expected trend in a flat rate environment lets turn to capital on slide q3 cet1 of reflected ongoing earnings growth and a continued pause in our share repurchase program last week we announced the q4 common dividend of per share payable on november we are well underway with our ccar resubmission and are on track to submit our revised capital plan in early november for participating banks there remains much to be determined by the federal reserve regarding specific outcomes of this process but we remain confident in the positioning of our balance sheet our robust capital and our proven approach to risk management capital actions over the past five years shown on the bottom reiterates our disciplined approach to deploying capital shares outstanding have declined as we repurchased at attractive levels relative to our growing tangible book value while we increased the dividend on five separate occasions these actions occurred as we grew risk weighted assets optimized our leading businesses and expanded product offerings we look forward to returning to a normalized environment when we can resume dynamic capital deployment turning to slide credit performance remained strong and better than anticipated reflecting a combination of broadbased consumer and commercial resilience and our expertise and dedicated approach within servicing and collection including efforts to increase engagement through easy to use digital tools for our customers the consolidated net charge off rate of basis points declined basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear in the upper right net chargeoffs of million declined million yearoveryear driven by retail auto and corporate finance in the bottom left retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points improved quarteroverquarter a departure from the typical seasonal trend of rising ncos through the second half of each year and represent less than half the prior year level of delinquency trends remained solid as both 30plus and 60plus results ended meaningfully below prior year levels we remain encouraged by the performance across our portfolios including deferred and nondeferred populations lets turn to slide given credit results yeartodate were lowering our retail auto nco outlook for fullyear to less than and if trends continue to outperform we could be closer to our consolidated reserves ended the quarter at billion as coverage of moved slightly higher quarteroverquarter ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 retail auto reserves and coverage levels remained stable overall these levels reflect our balanced approach and contemplate rising ncos driven by elevated levels of unemployment and ongoing uncertainty related to covid and the economy our current baseline forecast assumes unemployment remains elevated ending around consistent with prior quarters we do not include any stimulus related benefits in our reserve modeling we continue to expect retail auto losses to peak as we move through and we believe our current reserve level is sufficient to absorb this expected increase absent significant further deterioration due to the economic outlook we would not expect any additional build moving to slide ill briefly touch on the auto deferral program as of quarterend of covid deferrals have expired of participants have had two or more payments due and remain current or paid in full later stage performance migration has remained favorable to our expectations and is reflected in our q3 credit metrics in addition to strong consumer trends we diligently prepared for each stage of the deferral programs launching new digital tools that drove higher engagement and payment rates among participants we are pleased with the program on many fronts most notably the support it provided to our borrowers reflective of our customerfirst values on slide ill highlight a few additional metrics in the auto segment net financing revenue expanded quarter overquarter and yearoveryear reflecting growth in the retail margin and strong lease gains that more than offset over billion in lower earning assets driven by inventory levels noninterest expense grew reflecting the added resources and capabilities deployed within our service and customer care centers and as you can see on the bottom right portfolio yields continue to migrate higher while loss content remains strong overall execution within auto reflects the resilience of the auto asset class as well as our unique ability to adapt and continue to meet the needs of our dealers and customers detailed origination and asset trends are on slide q3 auto originations of billion expanded quarterover quarter and yearoveryear while average fico and nonprime levels remained stable used volume represented of originations or billion our highest quarterly used volume reflecting our ability to respond to market and consumer demand in realtime in the bottom left ending consumer assets expanded again in q3 ending at billion driven by retail and lease balanced growth on the bottom right average commercial assets declined though ending balances expanded insurance results are on slide core pretax income of million increased million linkedquarter and was essentially flat yearoveryear written premiums of million grew million quarteroverquarter reflecting a rebound in retail fi activity more than offsetting lower dealer inventory levels trends steadily improved throughout the quarter and we expect stabilizing to improving performance as dealer inventories build turning to slide corporate finance pretax income of million grew million quarteroverquarter and million yearoveryear reflecting steady credit performance and asset growth unfunded commitments of billion reflect our disciplined but opportunistic approach to growth while utilization remained lower given the environment our ability to lend and generate growth comes amid a challenging backdrop portfolio metrics reflect our prudent approach to risk management of balances are asset based of the portfolio has contractual libor floors while criticized and nonaccrual loans continue to perform well in the current economic backdrop ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 on slide mortgage pretax income of million expanded versus prior quarter and prior year as strong gain onsale activity more than offset elevated prepaymentrelated impacts directtoconsumer originations were solid as low mortgage rates generated strong refinance activity which was of our volume in the quarter ill close by reiterating how proud i am of our ally teammates who remain the driving force behind our accelerating operating and financial results as demonstrated in our consistent book value growth and expanding return profile we remain focused on doing it right for our customers communities and shareholders and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you jenn ill wrap up with a few comments on slide number like jenn i want to thank all of our associates for

continue successfully navigating on behalf of our customers which enhances longterm value for our shareholders with that daniel back to you and its time for qa daniel eller executive directorinvestor relations ally financial inc yeah thanks jb so as we head into qa ill remind participants to limit themselves to one question and one follow up operator you can now queue up the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning jenn and good morning jb jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning ryan jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe ill start jenn you saw a nice bounce back on the margin this quarter to s level and now youre talking about a path to can you maybe just talk about some of the drivers to the path i know you referenced some of them in the prepared remarks whats embedded in them as well as timing and also if we see liquidity come down as dealers pick up it seems like to me these tailwinds could actually see us go above so i was curious if you could just give us some color on the numbers as well as the moving pieces on the path to jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure ryan appreciate the question so couple of things this quarter we saw our nim expand about basis points and as i had messaged couple of weeks back that was exactly what we are expecting as we move forward from here we would expect the nim to continue to expand likely not quite at that level each quarter but we do see a really nice path in q4 and into in terms of expanding up to that mark now in terms of some of the drivers let me hit a few highlights so on the asset side as you can see weve continued to see our retail auto portfolio yield migrate up and thats as a result of kind of nine trailing quarters of new origination yields coming on the books at we were almost at this quarter so well continue to see that nice increase in retail auto originations which should offset some declines because of rates in other areas and in prepayment and so that should stabilize our overall earning asset yield now to your point there could be some opportunity for that asset yield to even expand as commercial balances come back and cash is redeployed in the commercial balances and we continue to grow corporate finance so at a minimum it will be stable and then on the liability side cost of funds came down over basis points and we continue to expect to continue to see cost of funds come down osa rate is at basis points and then youve got cds over ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 repricing down below which creates just this nice tailwind and then last but not least we continue to look for liability management opportunities to further take down cost of funds and you saw we early retired fhlb debt so to your point nice path forward i think strong dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet and id say at a minimum well be migrating towards that kind of as we enter ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and if i could do a followup ill stick with daniels guidance so just one followup jb you obviously have a huge windfall of revenue right now given all these tailwinds that jenn just referenced on the margin can you maybe just talk about just the magnitude of positive operating leverage youre targeting and what adjusted efficiency ratio and potentially what return do you think is doable in this kind of environment and ill just tag onto that just given the fact the stock continues to trade below tangible book value can you maybe just talk about your willingness to get much more aggressive on returning capital in the coming quarters before the valuation potentially expands in a meaningful way thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sure you got it right and obviously were happy to followup with you offline on any of these jenn maybe you want to start on kind of operating leverage targets things like that and then maybe ill take jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc the capital one because obviously thats a complicated question in light of the fed ccar and the environment but maybe jenn you can take the first part jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure yeah so on operating leverage i just described the path on the nim which ties into our path on net interest income and were anticipating continued revenue growth from net interest income on other revenue weve seen some outsized opportunity to take marketrelated gains over the last couple of quarters wed expect that to normalize the debt down to kind of that ph level but overall because of the strength in nii and continued strong performance in other revenue we would expect growth there which to your point ryan is going to drive positive operating leverage especially if you kind of adjust for some of these outsized gains that were seeing in the other revenue line item from a return perspective its still early as we think about but we are expecting to get back to kind of pre covid return levels kind of over the next kind of to months assuming that our path on the macros continues to be accurate and if anything has taught us things can move pretty quickly but based on what were seeing right now we should be able to return to precovid levels here in short order and then just on capital return i know jb want to jump in on this but priorities remain the same continue to invest in customer related growth i think the fact that we see a strong earnings path ahead allows us to continue to do that and then it will be up to the fed and kind of ccar to see where we have the ability to start repurchasing shares again but jb im sure you want to jump in on that as well ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean id start with really pleased with the results and pleased ryan with your recognition of the increasing pace and kind of inherent strength thats starting to show through the income statement so very focused there and i think with that provides us a lot of opportunities as jenn referenced in her prepared remarks this concept of essentialism thats something that were very focused on inside of ally so really what is it its simply the disciplined pursuit of less so i think what were being very focused on is driving as many efficiencies as possible utilizing technology kind of up and throughout the entire corporation and then using some of those savings to continue reinvesting in technology and digital tools and really making us even stronger for the long run on capital overall again i do think the theme that we talk about at ally and youre certainly hearing it being echoed from chairman powell just the amount of uncertainty that exist so i think weve been extraordinarily pleased with the state of the consumer right now the consumer is performing incredibly well and obviously thats showing up in our results and so we think theres plenty of numerical reasons to support pretty aggressive and pretty dynamic capital returns in the immediate future but you got still ongoing uncertainty with covid you dont understand the full implications if we have a change in the political landscape and so all these are dynamics were facing but i think were just focused on keeping our head down executing seeing strong revenue growth really come through the entire company and that affords us a lot of opportunities and hopefully a lot of opportunities for our shareholders as well ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc appreciate all the color nice quarter jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks ryan appreciate you operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you jb you talked about a very strong rebound in originations and the relatively quicker rebound relative to the previous cycle i guess if you if we peel back the onion a little bit on the trends how much of this is sustainable can some of this be a pull forward of demand and when we think about where its coming from is it share gains as well jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah sanjay thanks i do think it is fairly sustainable now obviously billion its a pretty robust quarter and i think as we pointed out its the highest level that weve seen in five years but i think theres still opportunities to see levels remain here or within this relative range i think as jenn pointed out you are starting to see a fairly ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 meaningful shift in the decline in public transportation i dont think thats necessarily short lived maybe its an alteration in the environment for the next couple of years but obviously that affords us a lot of opportunity and i think when i go out and talk to dealers and certainly engage with our auto team i think our expansion into these alternative channels the carvanas of the world the drivetimes and echoparks and other players like that coupled with the franchise dealers that were touching its pretty powerful and our ability to sustain strong originations and i think the other important point is we have been extraordinarily price disciplined i mean as jenn points out our well round it up and call it i mean this is weve been very focused on booking high quality earning asset yields if we gave up a touch of price we could expand that box and go well north of billion a quarter in originations weve just chosen to be very priced disciplined very price focused not chase the super prime product because you just dont generate all the attractive returns for us that we want to chase so for us we feel really good about our position we feel really good about where were playing in the credit environment and we think theres more room to run there sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you and my followup is on credit quality coupled with sort of returns jenn you mentioned that if the trends continue you could be for the fourth quarter into the year i guess if we marry that maybe what are the swing factors there how comfortable do you feel about credit i see the deferral trends look really favorable but then if you couple that with the nim discussion before as we look into i mean shouldnt the returns actually be higher than what you were expecting going forward because i dont know that weve seen nims in the past jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah appreciate the question sanjay and i think a lot comes back around credit and the ultimate path around delinquencies and ncos and i think what were observing and the industry is observing at large is just a disconnect between the macroeconomic factors and delinquency trends and so while were incredibly pleased with the performance yeartodate and q4 is shaping up to be strong we also want to be mindful of the environment that were in and what the ultimate path does look like how the path of covid and the economy shapes up and so i think at this point were just being really cautious around that i would like to reiterate as well that while we could see kind of or less than for full year we do have a retail auto reserve thats four times that so just from a income statement perspective we should have taken notice of the payment and we did that in the first quarter so we did it early we did it at large and were going to just continue to be mindful of the environment but absolutely if performance continues like this if delinquency rates continue to trail kind of plus down basis points then that credit loss could get pushed out kind of mid2021 or beyond and that obviously would impact our returns but i think as i described just a couple of minutes ago i think the fundamental drivers of our returns are very solid from nim perspective nii growth continuing to see other revenue continue to be strong maybe not quite at these levels but strong and to your point we do see a really attractive path on expanding returns which weve been talking about for some time now sanjay ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right well thank you guys good work jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks sanjay operator our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys just a question jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi rob jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp hi just a question on your partner relationships here i noticed there and you highlighted that youve upped your commitments to ph the room in carvana how has those opportunities evolved as weve kind of gone through and gotten into this new paradigm and what effect do those changes and evolutions have on your partnership strategy more broadly jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah rob appreciate the question i would say our partnerships with some of the newer entrants are very similar to what we have more broadly across auto and supporting all of our dealers which we want to be there for them in all environments and we want to be opportunistic i think what has been a big win for us here in is just the growth in some of these new dealers and weve been able to grow with our partners growth we had kind of record level of inflows and retail auto flows this quarter from those new partnerships so were going to continue to support all of our dealers our strategy has been around increasing application reach you can see that in some of the customer metrics jb shared applications continue to grow at a cagr and we feel good about our positioning in across the board and our dealers ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 and the other thing id say and jb talked a lot about this is just the modernization of auto continues you see consumer shift to more digital purchasing behaviors and because we have the partnerships that you just mentioned were able to shift with changing dynamics across consumer preferences as well robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it got it then just a quick one on capital and capital return cet1 right now thats obviously a little lower with the cecl adjustment do you have one eye on that fully phasedin cecl capital level when youre thinking about capital return or is it little too early to be thinking about that yet jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc oh no were always thinking about that yeah we think about that all day but i think the headlines around capital one we feel great about the position where these are the highest capital levels weve had in history where some kind of billion above our implied cet1 requirement from the scb and you couple that with the rest of the balance sheet with the billion reserve and we feel like we are in a really strong position across the balance sheet and then as we move forward as we were just talking about we see a strong path on earnings growth and so the question now is where do we deploy the growing capital from earnings and itll follow kind of the same path that weve been talking about customer growth is number one wed expect rwa to pick up as commercial balances pick up thats probably the most obvious driver of capital deployment we continue to see growth across every one of our businesses whether thats our ally lending business corporate finance dtc mortgage consumer auto as well as the commercial side and so that would be kind of path two and then i think jb summarized it really well we would like to move into a more normalized situation when it comes to repurchases especially with where our stock is trading relative to very strong book value growth robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you rob jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive

officer ally financial inc our goal is to make you look right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc well i appreciate that today especially on a friday ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so my question here is one that i know im going to get from investors which is around the sustainability and i think jenn earlier in your prepared remarks you highlighted how you do anticipate to see some steady demand going into im wondering if you could give us some color some comments that can support that just to give people some understanding of why you think some of these tailwinds are going to continue for at least several more quarters here jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and we appreciate the question and anticipated it which is why we added page to our earnings material today which is just about the positioning of our businesses and if you start first on the auto side auto continues to be a really strong performing asset class throughout and its where we play in kind of the prime segment but its really across the board and super prime as well and youre just seeing strength across the board and then when you look at where we sit in the industry with our scale with the breadth of products that we offer with the partnerships we just touched on we feel really wellpositioned to continue to see that outflow grow weve closed the gap on a yearoveryear basis we had record used application flow and so just the positioning of our model where we can take advantage of unique pockets within a growing and strong asset class we absolutely see sustainability there and for full year were likely to be pretty darn close to where we were last year from origination perspective and pretty close to that yield which remains at kind of record levels to the underlying benchmark so great flows great sustained pricing within auto and again we dont see any sign of that stopping just yet and arent anticipating that stopping and then on the consumer side you just think about the shift in banking around digitization and were already there were kind of digital you see the flows that we have this strong retention on the deposit side and weve done that with record declines in pricing so we feel really wellpositioned to meet the needs of our consumers and deposits and then continuing the theme of digitization thats where you see ally invest and also our dtc mortgage products picking up and theyre able to kind of draft off of the strong performance that weve had on the deposit side so feel really really good about all of our businesses in this environment and we added that customer slide as well because not only are we positioning ourselves well from a product perspective but were seeing that customer growth that we can continue to harvest over time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc and that is showing up in the scale that we are seeing in our new businesses ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it yeah no thats helpful so more legs to the stool and penetrating client base successfully so i get that thanks for the color on one other question on the capital return for you and jb is around the scb so the question i got from somebody the other day was does the scb change how flexible and nimble you can be is there a change in the buyback capability that the scb gives you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so i mean let me first start with the scb the rate and then just that the guidance that weve received around the scb so first of all it implies kind of a required cet1 of we already managed the company at so theres really no change there in terms of how we think about overall capital levels and then at least how they originally position the scb it should actually give us more flexibility betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc because as long as were managing capital deployment above that we should be able to really dynamic more dynamically deploy our capital as we move through the quarter so if anything betsy it should be a net positive just in terms of timing and magnitude of capital deployment but as jb i think highlighted very well theres still a lot of questions around how the frb will respond to ccar and we think were wellprepared for that but were mindful about there is still some uncertainty there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks so much appreciate it jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you betsy jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks betsy have a good weekend jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 you too operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks most of my questions have been asked and answered but i think the to me the most interesting part of the quarter has been you know the what you had predicted after q2 of ppnr improvement has certainly happened and i think you alluded to the ability to kind of continue to optimize your the right hand side of your balance sheet and maybe if you could spend just a minute or two on how much room you think there is both in terms of deposits replacing other liabilities as your balance sheet kind of normalizes in size and also kind of deposit pricing i think you lagged a little bit your peers at the beginning of this downward trend and are starting to catchup now so maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and i appreciate that moshe and were optimizing both sides of the balance sheet and i think steady earning asset yields are really important but on the liability side youre absolutely right we have a wide variety of opportunities to continue to optimize and the most obvious and impactful one is on the deposits we you know take osa we dropped osa rates basis points this quarter down to basis points and that was kind of in record time if you look at great financial crisis it took some months to get to this point and the industry kind of came down in a couple of months so just very accelerated decline in osa rates and so youll see that roll forward from partial year to full year as we head into and then you also cds repricing down so cds will reprice from over down to less than so that creates a nice tailwind for us and then as weve continued to see flows we can start continue to replace some of the broker deposits with retail deposits and if you look kind of a year ago broker deposits were about of our deposit stack thats down to so well continue to let that flow and then in terms of the other liabilities unsecured we had about billion in unsecured roll off in well keep kind of the volume the same but the rate will be better so well be bringing down cost of unsecured get a little bit less of an impact in but well have a nice roll forward there and then in terms of other liabilities you saw exactly i pointed out the fhlb early retirement were going to continue to look for ways to take down some of this more expensive debt because of this really strong tailwind we have from both deposit flows and pricing and then last but not least it just it gives us such a strategic advantage because while we have this cash we can use that excess cash to replace higher cost liabilities and were not forced to kind of invest into putting duration in our security portfolio less than so we feel just really great about dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet and the ability to continue to optimize liabilities take down that funding cost for several quarters to come moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and i certainly didnt mean to minimize the impact of pricing on the asset side but i the follow up i wanted to ask was about you mentioned kind of in passing that youre expecting plus used car values this year and i think that kind of had been minus to in the past and could you just indiscernible a ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 little bit about how that might have impacts going into given where used car values i mean which are probably up in actual terms they may not sustain that but theyre up substantially higher than that as of now jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and if maybe ill just dial it back to kind of late and heading into if you look at offlease supply we were hitting a peak here in simply because of supply side dynamics we were expecting to see a kind of to decline in overall used vehicle value this year now has really shaken everything up kind of across the industry we saw precipitous drop in the second quarter as auction lanes kind of dried up but as the auto asset class has continued to remain strong consumer demand for vehicles covidrelated has continued to accelerate and new vehicle inventories are at you know kind of nine year lows down yearoveryear were just seeing demand for used spike up kind of to unprecedented levels were in the midteens here in q3 and thats expected moshe to continue into q4 and be strong quite frankly in the first half of moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc yeah jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc now at some point we do expect this to normalize a bit and so while were expecting overall used vehicle pricing to come about up about we do think itll normalize down a couple percentage points heading into with strength in the first half and some pressures in the last half but i will say bigger picture that offlease inventory does start to come down heading into so there could be some sustained tailwinds kind of over the next to months simply because of that and i mentioned there are in kind of gain per vehicle and thats predominantly in the suv and truck category which continues to be in high demand across our consumers some of the other categories the small cars and smaller vehicles dont have quite the gains that weve seen in our book moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you moshe operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning jb and jenn ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey bill good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi so we clearly see the benefit in your numbers as you guys have leaned into used and more of your ph business as we mix there how high would you be comfortable letting that used versus new mix get is there any reason not to let it get too high and then could you also maybe give some color on the relative difference in profitability of new versus used just at a high level jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so bill we dont have any cap on used i mean used has really strong risk adjusted returns were very comfortable managing the credit risk we know how to price it we have no cap there so well just continue to be opportunistic across new and used and well let the numbers play out in terms of profitability i think ive shared in the past that the pricing on a used vehicle tends to be kind of basis points higher than a new vehicle and the delta on credit risk tends to be just basis points basis points or so so you can kind of do the math around that but we absolutely get paid kind of times the increase in credit risk and the yield that we see on the used car front and in this environment with used vehicles values continuing to outperform that return only gets a bit higher bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it very helpful thank you and as a followup if i may can you go a little bit deeper into your outlook for a dealer floor plan lending any constraints on the production side there still and when a little bit more on perhaps when balanced growth could start to resume there jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean the oems are back into kind of full speed ahead production i think theyre about manufacturing levels as they were precovid i think whats driving this slower build in terms of inventories has just been very strong pent up and very strong demand again going back to auto continues to be an asset class winner in this environment so as quick as theyre manufacturing the cars theyre kind of getting sold off a lot so what weve seen is kind of a trough here in july and then weve picked up about billion in august and september continuing to see it slowly come back but though we wouldnt expect to be back to precovid levels in our floor plan book until late bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure thanks bill jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks bill jeffrey jonathan
