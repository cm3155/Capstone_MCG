and welcome thank you for joining the call today were pleased to announce our fourth quarter results which zach will detail later these results are again supported by our colleagues across the bank who live our purpose every day as we make peoples lives better help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve now on to slide there are five key messages we want to leave you with today first we are leveraging our position of strength and executing on our strategic growth initiatives we are well positioned to benefit during times like these we managed our capital levels to enable us to accelerate initiatives during and support continued growth we added key specialty verticals in commercial banking and expanded into the carolinas second we outperformed on both deposits and loans throughout the year our colleagues are acquiring new customers and deepening our existing customer relationships importantly we delivered this growth while effectively managing our deposit beta third we expect to modestly expand net interest income as we manage the challenges of the interest rate cycle and are driving increased fee revenues fourth we are rigorously managing credit across our portfolios consistent with our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite credit trends are normalizing as expected and we continue to believe we will outperform the industry on credit through the cycle finally we remain intently focused on our core strategies huntington remained resilient through the events of emerging as one of the strongest regional banks we maintained our disciplined execution and we expect to grow earnings over the course of and continuing into and beyond i will move us on to slide to recap our performance in huntington delivered solid results over the course of the year against a challenging backdrop while the banking sector faced headwinds early in the year huntington emerged as a secular winner gaining new customers adding over billion of deposit growth and further bolstering our capital we also increased loans by billion for the full year or while driving capital ratios higher we expect the pace of loan growth to accelerate in we added to our revenue base primarily as net interest income increased by for the full year we maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and digital capabilities having again been awarded the number one ranking by jd power for both categories we remained focused on executing our strategies including growing consumer primary bank relationships by additionally we completed the realignment of business segments we also delivered on efficiency initiatives including operation accelerate the voluntary retirement program staffing efficiencies business process offshoring and branch and other real estate consolidations we were nimble and opportunistic adding key talent this past year with the addition of three new specialty commercial banking verticals we also expanded our commercial and regional bank into the carolinas adding experienced teams in these attractive and highgrowth markets additionally we further strengthened our balance sheet and drove capital ratios higher over the course of the year were getting ahead of proposed industry requirements and finally credit was managed exceptionally well with full year net chargeoffs of basis points moving to slide looking ahead to we have a clear set of objectives we will leverage our position of strength to increase growth of both deposits and loans this outlook will result in accelerated revenue growth and huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 is further bolstered by fee opportunities this posture coupled with our dynamic balance sheet management and hedging programs is expected to benefit the revenue and profitability outlook for and further expand into and beyond this aligns with the improving macro backdrop the higher probability of continued gdp growth and the avoidance of a hard landing while we deliver this accelerated growth we will continue to maintain our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our fourth quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of and adjusted eps of the quarter included million of notable items primarily related to the fdic special assessment which impacted eps by per common share additionally the termination of the payfixed swaption hedging program impacted pretax income by million or per share return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was average deposits continued their trend of growth into the fourth quarter increasing by billion or cumulative deposit beta totaled through yearend loan balances increased by million as we continue to optimize the pace of loan growth to drive the highest return on capital credit quality remains strong the trend is normalizing consistent with our expectations and net chargeoffs totaled basis points allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at turning to slide as i noted average loan balances increased quarter over quarter and were higher by year over year we expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of total commercial loans increased by million for the quarter and included distribution finance which increased by million benefited by normal seasonality as manufacturer shipments increased due to inventory build of winter products auto floorplan increased by million and cre balances which declined by million including the impact of payoffs and normal amortization and all other commercial categories net decreased as we continue to drive optimization toward the highest returns in consumer growth was led by residential mortgage which increased by million and rvmarine which increased by million while auto loan balances declined for the quarter turning to slide as noted we continued to gather deposits consistently in the fourth quarter average deposits increased by billion or from the prior quarter turning to slide growth was maintained each month throughout the fourth quarter continuing the recent trend total cumulative deposit beta ended the year at in line with our expectations and reflecting the decelerating rate of change we would expect at this point in the rate cycle as weve noted in the past where beta ultimately tops out will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle in terms of the level and timing of the peak and the duration of any extended pause before a decrease given market expectations for rate cuts to start sometime in our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged trending a few percentage points higher and then beginning to revert and fall if and when we see rate cuts from the fed when interest rate cuts commence we expect to manage betas on the way down with the same discipline as we have during the increasing rate cycle huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 turning to slide noninterest bearing mix shift continues to track closely to our forecast with deceleration of sequential changes the noninterest bearing percentage decreased by basis points from the third quarter and we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and stabilize during on to slide for the quarter net interest income decreased by million or to billion net interest margin declined sequentially to in line with our forecast cumulatively over the cycle we have benefited from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins with net interest revenues growing at an cagr over the past two years reconciling the change in nim from q3 we saw a decrease of basis points this was primarily due to lower spread net of free funds which accounted for basis points along with a 2basispoint negative impact from lower fhlb stock dividends and a 2basispoint reduction from hedging turning to slide let me share a few added thoughts around the fixed rate loan repricing opportunity that will benefit us over the moderate term the construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate in indirect auto which is a shorter approximately twoyear average life and in arms with a fouryear average life the remainder of approximately is longer average life fixed rate weve seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle even as the forward curve forecasts lower shortterm rates many of our fixed rate loan portfolios retain substantial upside repricing opportunity for some time to come we forecast approximately billion to billion of fixed rate loan repricing opportunity in with an estimated yield benefit of approximately basis points slide provides the drivers of our spread revenue growth as a reminder we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios the basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the lower end by a scenario which includes five rate cuts in the higher scenario assumes rates stay higher for longer and tracks closely with the feds dot plot from year end this scenario assumes three cuts in we continue to be focused on managing net interest margin in a tight corridor should the lower rate scenario play out and we see rate cuts as early as march that will likely result in a margin over the course of the year within a range near the level we saw in the fourth quarter this would equate to a net interest margin between and for each quarter of if the higher for longer scenario comes to pass we expect the margin to expand and at a level that is up to basis points above that as we saw in december the outlook for longerterm interest rates also moved lower significantly there were a number of benefits from this lower market rate outlook first that resulted in higher capital levels given aoci accretion which supports our accelerated loan growth outlook now second it provides for easing deposit competition over time third it provides credit support for borrowers with the potential for locking in lower long term rates however the rate outlook is incrementally more challenging for fullyear spread revenue than the levels we had seen underlying our guidance in december net of these items including the forecasted pace of loan growth we now expect net interest income on a dollar basis to trough in the first quarter before expanding sequentially from that level over the course of the year turning to slide our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at billion and has grown quarter over quarter at quarterend we continue to benefit from a diverse and highly granular deposit base with huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 insured deposits our pool of available liquidity represented of total uninsured deposits a peerleading coverage turning to slide our level of cash and securities at yearend increased as weve begun to reinvest portfolio cash flows during the fourth quarter this investment strategy is consistent with our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over time we have reduced overall hedge duration of the portfolio from years to years over the past months turning to slide weve updated our forecast for the recapture of aoci as of yearend weve recaptured of total aoci from the peak level at september using market rates at yearend we would recapture an estimated incremental of aoci over the next three years turning to slide we continued to be dynamic in positioning our hedging program as the rate outlook changed over the course of the fourth quarter we focused our objective incrementally on the protection of nim in down rate scenarios and actively reduced instruments that were intended to protect capital in uprate scenarios as we announced in late december we terminated the payfixed swaptions program as our assessment of the probability for substantial uprate moves decreased over the course of q2 through q4 this program worked as intended providing significant protection against possible tail risk uprate moves with a modest overall cost for that insurance additionally during the quarter we added to our down rate nim protection strategies adding billion of forward starting receive fixed swaps and adding billion of floor spreads we exited billion of collars which were near expiration our objective with respect to our downrate hedging activities remains unchanged to support the management of net interest margin in as tight a range as possible moving on to slide our fee growth strategies remain centered on three key areas capital markets payments and wealth management note this quarter in our earnings materials weve updated the presentation of our noninterest income categories in order to more clearly highlight our strategic areas of focus and more closely align to the way we manage the business slide in the appendix provides further detail on the components of each line item these three key focus areas for fee growth collectively represent of total noninterest income were seeing positive underlying growth in each of these areas in capital markets were pleased that revenues expanded sequentially both advisory and core bank capital market products grew in the quarter our outlook is constructive for and we expect capital markets to remain a key driver for fee revenue growth over the medium term payments and cash management revenue includes debit and credit card revenues along with treasury management and merchant processing our payments opportunity is substantial reflecting of total fee revenues today with the potential for significant growth over time wealth and asset management revenue has benefited from the realignment earlier this year which brought together our private bank and retail advisory businesses under one umbrella our advisory penetration rate of the customer base continues to increase as wealth advisory households have grown year over year and assets under management are up from a year ago huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 moving on to slide on an overall level gaap noninterest income decreased million to million for the fourth quarter excluding the marktomarket on the pay fixed swaptions and the crt premium fees increased by million quarter over quarter moving on to slide on expenses gaap noninterest expense increased by million and underlying core expenses increased by million as i mentioned we incurred million of notable item expenses related primarily to the fdic deposit insurance fund special assessment during the quarter it also included the last portion of costs related to our staffing efficiency program and corporate real estate consolidations excluding these items core expense included higher personnel and professional services driven by seasonally higher benefits expense incentives as well as consulting expenses the level of expenses we saw in the fourth quarter is largely consistent with the dollar amount we expect quarterly over the course of this is inclusive of the investments weve discussed previously as well as sustained efficiencies we are driving across the company slide recaps our capital position reported common equity tier increased to and has increased sequentially for five quarters our adjusted cet1 ratio inclusive of aoci was this metric increased basis points compared to the prior quarter driven by adjusted earnings net of dividends as well as the benefit from the credit risk transfer transaction we announced in december which more than offset the impact from the fdic special assessment we also saw significant benefit from aoci recapture given the move in rates during the quarter our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth we intend to drive adjusted cet1 inclusive of aoci into our operating range of to on slide credit quality continues to perform very well and with normalization of metrics consistent with our expectations net chargeoffs were basis points for the quarter this was higher than q3 by basis points and resulted in fullyear net chargeoffs of basis points this outcome was aligned with our outlook for fullyear net chargeoffs between and basis points at the low end of our target through the cycle range for net charge offs of to basis points gross chargeoffs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with the overall change in net chargeoffs largely a result of lower recoveries given ongoing normalization nonperforming assets increased from the previous quarter while remaining below the prior level the criticized asset ratio increased quarter over quarter with risk rating changes within commercial real estate being the largest component allowance for credit losses was higher by basis point to of total loans and our acl coverage ratio continues to be among the top quartile in the peer group lets turn to our outlook for as we mentioned we expect to drive accelerated loan growth between and for the full year deposits are likewise expected to continue their solid trend of growth between and as a result of the loan growth and margin outlook i shared earlier net interest income for the full year is expected to range between down to up the pace of loan growth coupled with the rate scenario we see actually play out will drive the range of spread revenue if the higher for longer rate scenario plays out and loan growth tracks to the top end of our range we expect net interest income to grow by approximately if the lower scenario comes to fruition and loan growth tracks to the lower end of our growth range we could see spread revenue declining percentage points in both scenarios i expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter before expanding throughout from that level huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 noninterest income on a core underlying basis is expected to increase between and the baseline of core excludes notable items the marktomarket impact from the pay fixed swaption program as well as crt impacts fee revenue growth is expected to be driven primarily by capital markets payments and wealth management core expenses are expected to increase by this level reflects the finalization of our budget and includes the additional loan growth we discussed earlier which will have some incremental compensation expense tied to production expenses could fluctuate depending on the level of revenuedriven compensation primarily associated with our feebased revenues including capital markets the tax rate is expected to be approximately for the full year we expect net chargeoffs for the full year to be between and basis points with that well conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions and answers tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question today is coming from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to start off on the expense guide change i know its a small change from to but it is higher than some of your peers are guiding to for just hoping you could elaborate more on whats going into that and also if there is a similar flex on the expense side as there is on the revenue so for instance if you get to youre down nii a number with more rate cuts does that drive a little bit of flex in the expense side as well zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc great question manan this is zach ill take that we the guidance that weve given back in october and in december was really primarily designed to be an early view for you so you can get an insight into some of the huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 key decisions we were making for us to really be able to discuss that in detail that was approximately we discussed before the finalization of our budget reflects the additional loan growth that weve now added to the plan and associated fee revenues as well thats what represent the difference of the to give you a sense its about million a quarter so relatively small i think you are the underlying drivers of that are unchanged from what we had discussed before well continue to drive significant efficiencies in core based on expenses with a number of programs well continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives well execute on the incremental build of capabilities in automation and data get ahead of the coming regulations and well execute on the new really attractive commercial growth opportunities we discussed before all of thats included in that number and no change to our expectation as well about reducing that growth rate as we go into excuse me back to more normalized levels as it relates to your question in terms of the kind of marginal sensitivity of it certainly that will lead to some degree of that i think the expense guide is generally calibrated for sort of the middle of the ranges weve guided in terms of revenues and so ph there will be some potential upside of expenses if all of the revenues hit the high end and likewise some potential opportunity if revenues were at the lower end manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you and my next question was on the deposit franchise you have a pretty strong core consumer deposit franchise and some of your peers have highlighted that theres still some lagged upward repricing in deposits there so can you talk about how you expect those deposits to behave over the next few quarters and then as the fed begins to cut rates zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill take that one again what weve been seeing here in the marketplace broadly with respect to deposit costs and deposit beta both across both consumer and commercial is the ph as what you expect a deceleration of the sequential changes and very much for us trending highly aligned to our expectations as well i will tell you that we are beginning to see in the marketplace a fairly constructive initial signs of firms preparing for what will likely be soon a ph downrate environment with a shortening for example time deposit terms with a change of promotional terms on money market and select testing of different price points for each segments and each geographies all of which is what youd expect to indiscernible be a series of downgraded moves with respect to your specific question on consumer and sort of will that trend i think the answer is yes what we have been saying all along is that deposit costs and beta will continue to trend at a decelerating rate through the pause period until such time that there is a great reduction and so thats our expectation as well i wont say the gotomarket pricing is generally pretty consistent if not again testing somewhat lower price points but theres of course sort of an embedded momentum of somewhat upward bias in terms of pricing for at least another quarter here and then well see do we get a rate cut in march somewhat aggressive in our view is possible in which case downgrade begins very quickly is that the rate environment hold out the deposits in september in which case is of the kind of a longer period of indiscernible huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks for your question manan operator our next question is coming from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and by the way whoever wrote that script the guidance could not be any clearer so that was great just that being said a few followup questions the loan growth guidance from your peers would imply that the macro outlook which seems pretty consensus is indicative of softer opportunities and perhaps this is a good chance clearly youve been telling us for the past few years that youve set yourself up differently and youve set yourself up differently to outperform and maybe go back through those opportunities that they think that the average loan growth number is certainly notable versus peers and perhaps remind us of why huntington has a particularly unique set of growth opportunities for this year stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc erika this is steve ill start with that because youve asked a broader history and then zach you may want to add so first we do think that the discipline on our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite which has been in place now for years has been a governor and it has helped us as weve decided what business to pursue and what not to seek with that in mind weve been very purposeful and strategic about growing these businesses and you saw at the investor day a midteens rate of growth in like a specialty banking so we have a very strong middle market core banking set of capabilities we have a tremendous amount of small business capabilities and capacity we have market density in ohio on small business and were achieving that now in other states so the core sort of regional banking franchise performing very very well and you add to that these specialties that have been put in place just three new ones last year which by the way theyre all off to terrific starts and then the expansion weve been in like dallas and charlotte for a decade or more when we see opportunities we then pursue them and an example of that is in the carolinas where we believe weve got fantastic group of new colleagues coming to us with teams these are some just outstanding people that weve been following for years and it all came together we were investing others were not and there was a moment to be dynamic in addition to that we still have opportunities in these tcf markets were doing incredibly well in michigan but where i would say were early stage still in chicago the twin cities and denver and we like those markets each of those markets so we believe with the investments weve made in specialty banking the core regional bank performing well with opportunity weve got lots of growth potential in the next few years and thats with the i didnt talk about the asset finance business huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 so our distribution finance business is a horse they had a phenomenal year last year our auto business is one of our best businesses weve got one of our really terrific teams in that area and floorplan has done very very well in terms of its growth as well so lots of growth options the equipment finance more broadly a lot of growth options in that and youre seeing that through the cycle and so we believe were poised to outperform and had budgeted and expect our colleagues to do so in the coming years zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc this is zach i just want to talk about two things first of all thanks for the compliment in terms of the guidance and all the credit to our really terrific investor relations team but just the one thing i would add on top of that is we were pretty purposeful about staying on a growth footing across the board and importantly in terms of the financial resources and investments that were putting against our core growth opportunities and recognize that the net outcome of that including some of the other things that we want to do in terms of data and automation capabilities would result in an overall expense growth that was higher than we would want to have relative to revenue growth but higher than we would typically target and it certainly was something we discussed at length as you know but we took that view purposely and recognized it was contrarian because the in our view that the longterm earnings potential of staying in that growth posture is so much more advantageous than worry to a really significantly ratcheted back investments and expenses and so a bit of shortterm challenge with respect to operating leverage will yield very significantly better earnings growth trajectory through the course of and earnings outlook looks exceptionally strong as well so just to tap on to steves point i think the whole system is really working and an analogy of how to follow the results here erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc for sure and you had the capital so it makes it all makes sense and just a followup question again so many moving pieces in terms of the rate outlook but zach maybe update us on your rate sensitivity as of after some of the moves that you made in terms of your balance sheet management and also if you could give us a little bit more detail about what you mean in terms of managing the betas on the way down in a similar discipline and i wonder if you could give us maybe your expectations on deposit beta for the first basis points of rate cuts zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure great questions as well theres a lot in there to unpack so let me address those both as it relates to asset sensitivity for december i expect it to be roughly consistent with the asset sensitivity we saw that was reported in october and youll see that come out in the q sorry in the k as weve discussed over time the business is naturally asset sensitive and so clearly on the way up with the interest rate cycle benefited very significantly in terms of margin expansion and revenue growth i will note as well something just as important to assess as youre thinking about asset sensitivity is in our securities portfolio as you know we hedged a large portion of availableforsale securities which has benefited significantly in terms of yields rising higher and protecting capital in the asset sensitivity metric in the indiscernible for example it represents about percentage point of additional sensitivity from those huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 swaps those swaps will roll off over the course of the next to months and most of that impact of sensitivity will begin to ramp off starting the second half of and continuing on for about a 12month period thereafter the other thing id just say is that as an important point is those sensitivity metrics are pretty academic and not standardized across the industry with lots of assumptions the beta being the most significant but also whether those analyses are ramps on top of the forward curve or whether theyre just from the start point ours is a ramp on top of the forward curve so certainly it was important to assess those assumptions pretty carefully in comparing those metrics across firms so in terms of our balance sheet management posture incrementally from here i see the opportunity to add downside rate reduction hedges our hedging strategy is incrementally shifting from a focus on capital protection to a focus on downrate protection as we discussed in the prepared remarks and we added some of that in q4 i suspect well continue to be incrementally adding into those downrate protection strategies over time which would gradually reduce downside asset sensitivity in terms of deposit beta and what we would be expecting for the first x basis points are to give you a sense in the scenario that im looking at where rates in fact begin to fall in march and then have five cuts in a little more than a year scenario we would expect to see about roughly down beta over a threequarter period by the end of would of course be less than that if there was an extended pause during indiscernible summer time period but just to give you a sense of sort of the sensitivity to your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so clear thanks so much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks erika operator our next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the capital front i know your cet1 increased nicely about basis points to in the fourth quarter just as you look at their trajectory here and your outlook for earnings and capital organic capital generation how are you thinking about potentially ramping up buybacks and capital return overall thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc great question john thanks this is zach ill take that one well were very pleased with the outcomes around the overall action plan we have with respect to managing capital and capital priorities throughout the course of as weve talked about actively modulating the pace of loan growth to balance additional loan growth and revenue with also accreting capital in the balance sheet clearly in the fourth quarter benefiting significantly from a recapture of aoci which allows us now to even yet again accelerate the pace of loan growth as we discussed earlier and for the foreseeable future i see us continuing on with that posture driving the most important capital priority we have is to fund high return loan growth and there is a significant opportunity for us to do that which is the most valuecreating decision thats in front of us and importantly at our adjusted cet1 is it has been rising a lot and we want to drive that into the to operating rate that we discussed over time so i think for the foreseeable future well continue on with that plan once we get into the to range with adjusted cet1 well reassess our posture with respect to share repurchases over time share repurchases are very very important point part of the valuation creation model for the company and id also expect us to get back to them and were going to drive through those outcomes as soon as we possibly can stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and john as zach shared with you in the third quarter call we are advancing and if the pending capital requirements are in place so were building capital now that will meet those requirements should they be adopted john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right thank you and then also for you steve i guess related to that maybe if you could just talk about the whole debate around the need for scale as you look longer term at the evolution thats going on right now within the regional banks both the last years failures and so the regulatory requirements and the need for scale to compete how do you view the potential for whole bank ma has a role in huntingtons outlook and whats the earliest do you think from an industry perspective not necessarily for huntington that do you think we can actually see a pickup in whole bank ma given the backdrop in regulators stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well thats a series of questions john ill try to answer them but i may miss on one aspect lets just back up for a moment we had three idiosyncratic banks fail and youve seen the rest of the industry sort of adjust and adapt and respond very quickly and the core strength of the industry i dont think is in question now for us we believe in having a very focused disciplined and broadly diversified set of businesses and weve been able to build those and achieve that posture and it has served us very very well as weve seen in the second half of last year and continuing into this year so were very bullish on our ability to organically grow and expect and thats our focus that well continue to do that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 you may see further announcements from us this year in terms of organic growth moves and i expect that we will continue to be maybe a bit contrarian but agile as we continue to invest we think we have tremendous opportunities already in the business lines that we have so in terms of scale i think the regulatory response is in reaction to those three failures is raising questions about how much tailoring will the industry or banks will benefit from in the industry over time the expectations have clearly increased as they should and we are investing in our risk management platform i think i shared on the third quarter call for example we will have much better intraday visibility on deposit flows in the near term as a consequence there are series of things like this that were addressing now i dont know that weve been investing in risk management since i arrived in so i dont know how we really compare to other banks i think weve always viewed the stress test results where weve been top quartile or even leading in terms of the portfolio stresses by the regulators as a barometer and it looks like that was a very good measure at least at this point so were not anticipating a change in posture at this stage we dont feel compelled to we got to do something and yet at the same time should there be opportunity somewhere in the future we take a look but it has to be in a riskadjusted context that makes sense to us and i dont see that activity in i think weve got a tremendous amount of core growth to deliver and were excited by that john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks john thank you operator our next questions are from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i want to start for you zach big picture so historically a steep yield curve has been a positive catalyst for bank margins and earnings but given how you position the balance sheet right with the use of hedges have you in essence created a way much of that potential benefit in order to have a more stable nim today zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 great question steve i think the short answer to your question is no a steeper yield curve continues to benefit us obviously that environment would be indicative of funding costs which would represent solid margins against where asset yields are i think were in this really strange environment with inverted yield curves and with the dramatic reduction forecasted pretty quick here so well see how it all plays out but i think for us the puts and takes with respect to nim outlook in the moderate terms in one were going to continue to benefit very significantly from fixed asset repricing i tried to provide some incremental clarity about that in the prepared remarks in the presentation indiscernible to 100basispoint moves in overall portfolio yield in key fx categories will continue to see that benefit us out not only to but to and beyond another thing is for us the as of the curve becomes less inverted well see our negative carry from our down rate hedge protection program reduce the negative carry impact by the way in q4 it was around basis points of drag weve talked about likely well see about bps of that come back to us if you believe the scenario will kind of pretty align forward curve here over the next four quarters funding costs again in a steeper yield curve environment where short end rates have fallen will really start to benefit us in terms of beginning to pivot towards down beta and actually executing on down beta to erikas question earlier and those things in total essentially offset for us in our nim the variable yield reduction that well see when the short end comes down so i still believe that that goldilocks scenario of a nice upward slope in the yield curve is accretive to margins and is supportive of it and the goal weve got is the same to try to really collar the nim here put a floor under it and really position for upside and i think the last im going to say is kind of getting to your question as well the modeling that we have done about and weve been saying this for a while really highlights nim expansion opportunities which again is sort of a indication that the upward slope in yield curve is positive steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful zach i asked the question because earlier you said if the rates stay higher for longer your nim would be about basis points higher in versus the fed cutting but as we move beyond theres a clear benefit to the nim are you able to quantify for us like on a longerterm basis assuming the forward curve played out given the whats on and whats rolling off where the nim could be long term for huntington zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure yeah and then by the way the point on the higher nim in the scenario of higher for longer its not only a scenario where short ends stays higher for longer but also longer ends stays higher for longer i think i will note much of our balance sheet yields hit off the belly of the curve to two to fiveyear range and so i think thats an important point to consider look over the longer term i see north of into the low in terms of nims as a sustainable level of course the business mix continues to shift so i think its hard to really be precise about that how we were several years out well have to continue to do our modeling but over the foreseeable future we see that range of sort of to in a quicker rate reduction scenario maybe as much as bps higher than that if rates stay higher for longer through and then i would see another stepup into assuming the yield curve holds generally indiscernible huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you so much operator our next question is from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of guidance clarifications for you zach when you say net interest income is a trough how deep is that trough how much lower do you where do you want us to start i guess for zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good question q1 by the way is typically seasonally lower just with day count and just other mix items and so i think well probably see a level that is lower than q4 by around the same amount that q4 was lower than q3 and then begin to grow from there and so its really about kind of trajectory from there thats really the major difference in the guidance range given that if you just pull back loan growth i would expect in q1 will be about the same yearonyear as we saw in q4 ie around and then sort of steadily accelerating from there and ending the year growing at or even potentially above the high end of the loan growth range the average should be in the to i discussed it was a trajectory for sure during the year and likewise in terms of nim i think its likely that the nim will likely be at its lowest point in the year in the first quarter and then kind of rising pretty heavily depending on the scenario you look at but thats sort of the general trajectory that im expecting huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good i think its important to set that up and then on expenses when you say consistent theres a lot of handwringing last quarter on your expense guide and when you say consistent are you basically saying flatline expenses quarterly for meaning that all the expense investments and hiring and things that youve done are essentially in the run rate today and you dont see a lot of these pressures as progresses is that fair zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc its an excellent point really appreciate the chance to clarifying that broadly speaking the answer is yes the dollar amount of expenses overall we saw in a core basis in q4 the forecast weve got and our budget represents pretty similar dollar amounts overall for each of the quarters during coincidentally theres in my mind ill try to illustrate this picture for you theres a variety of factors that are kind of offsetting each other and driving within that i would say theres still a little bit of additional rampup of run rate some of the incremental capability investments that were doing likewise a little bit of additional rampup in some of these new initiatives like in the commercial business were also actively tuning our overall strategic investments to modestly offset that and then lastly youve got these efficiency programs which are cumulating in their impact over time the business process reengineering initiative weve been driving for quite some time we internally call it operation accelerate the business process offshoring initiative which by the way is also growing and cumulating so theres sort of a series of factors that are netting together but the result of it is basically dollars that are pretty consistent with a pretty tight range in q4 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good very helpful thank you very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you operator instructions thank you and our next question will be from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning this is nate stein on behalf of matt just wanted to ask about commercial credit commercial real estate net chargeoffs increased versus level can you talk about what drove that and just touch on the outlook for commercial real estate at credit quality this year and then on the ci side these also continue to normalize can you talk about what youre seeing in this book thank you brendan a lawlor a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 sure nate this is brendan ill take that for the quarter yes we did see on a basis point respectable there was an increase in the commercial real estate side but id want to sort of point you to the dollars there it was million of chargeoffs in the quarter and it really represented three transactions so its consistent with our view of the real estate portfolio at this time which is the from a chargeoff perspective the focus will be in the office portfolio thats where we think that there is potential for lost content which is why weve increased our reserves to approximately there and so what you see in the current quarter is sort of the manifestation of that message that weve been delivering for some time when i take a step back and look more broadly the portfolio on commercial in general is actually performing pretty well i mean the ci side of the house has had its individual idiosyncratic issues but in general the strength of the portfolio is the result of our strong portfolio management and our lowtomoderate risk profile that we target so i feel really good about the commercial portfolio at this time stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so nate its steve the gross chargeoffs q3 and q4 were million apart but it was very very similar the difference was in all of recoveries the three portfolios performing very well the office portfolio has had minimal losses bps for the year ph q1 chargeoffs is outstanding were very pleased with how the performance has occurred and were confident going forward thanks for the question nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right thank you and if i could just ask one followup on the criticized assets so these also kicked up in the fourth quarter can you talk about what drove that brendan a lawlor a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc this is brendan again nate as zach said in the prepared remarks it really came out of our commercial real estate portfolio the impact of higher shortterm rates has persisted and thats whats reflected in those results again we had been signaling through the second half of last year that we expected criticized to move up and thats exactly how it played out again we have good confidence in our client selection in that portfolio and solid reserve against it overall so i guess i would classify that as just more credit normalization across the portfolio stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you for the question operator our next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just wanted to follow up on the loan growth guide steve it does feel at the higher end of what weve seen over the last week from your peers sorry if i missed it but give us a sense of how much of this is just market share gain that you expect versus the underlying growth that youre seeing in these markets and your expectations i guess like the gdp growth stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well weve had growth last year of if anything i think the signal from the fed pivot will foster further loan growth for the industry we are in an advanced position and so well capture share from that but we also have these specialty banking initiatives in the carolinas and they begin with no portfolio so theres no prepayment repayment risk obviously and thats all net loan growth but and those groups are off to terrific starts were very very pleased with the quality of the colleagues weve been able to attract to huntington and im quite confident in our teams both the core teams that theyll deliver in our footprint especially banking teams and frankly our consumer lending teams are outstanding as well so as we come into the year weve got momentum and were going to continue to invest in these businesses and that cumulatively should help us achieve or even exceed the goals ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess what i didnt hear steve was any mention of fiscal stimulus the chips act et cetera flowing through your market is that not as meaningful going forward around moving the needle on growth stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the markets have broadly speaking were talking about states that were in with our network but here in columbus which is what youre referring the intel plant that plant is well under construction and the supply chain commitments will largely be made we think this year as they move towards opening in the following year so we have some unusual factors that are strengthening the outlook here in greater columbus and we have very very significant market share here and lead by a lot in most categories and but it will also benefit the broader region and thats one of just many sectors that have chosen the midwest think about batteries from east michigan ann arbor through columbus and some of the announcements last year including the honda joint venture here in greater columbus on the battery front theres a lot of investment thats being made in the core footprint all of which will generate economic benefit for the industry so for the industry and certainly for us with our leadership position in many of these areas thanks for the question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so i
