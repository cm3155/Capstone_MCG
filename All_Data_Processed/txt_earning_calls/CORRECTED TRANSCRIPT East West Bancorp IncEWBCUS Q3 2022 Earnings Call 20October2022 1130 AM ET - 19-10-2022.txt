loan portfolio is wellbalanced between commercial real estate commercial and industrial and residential mortgage this diversification is a fundamental strength that provides both stability and optionality to generate prudent growth as economic cycles change total deposits were billion as of september a decrease of million or from june third quarter average deposit were billion essentially unchanged from the second quarter our deposit book is well diversified by deposit type and of total deposits were noninterestbearing demand accounts as of september turning to slide we have a resilient balance sheet with strong capital and high liquidity as you can see in the exhibit on this slide all our capital ratios expanded quarteroverquarter as of september we had a common equity tier ratio of a total capital ratio of and a tangible common equity ratio of east west board of directors has declared fourth quarter dividends for the companys common stock the quarterly common stock dividend of is payable on november to stockholders of record on november we did not execute any buybacks in the third quarter moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio beginning with slide as of september ci loans outstanding were billion sequentially up and total ci commitments were billion sequentially up our ci loan utilization rate was unchanged quarteroverquarter at our ci portfolio is well diversified by industry and sector slide and show the details of our commercial real estate portfolio which is well diversified by geography and property type and consists of low loan to value loans total commercial real estate loans were billion as of september up from june east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 in slide we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio which consists of singlefamily mortgages and home equity lines of credit and is primarily originated through east west bank branches i would highlight that of our home equity lines of credit are in a first lien position residential mortgage loan total billion as of september growing from june i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start with our asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on slides and the asset quality of our portfolio continues to be strong quarteroverquarter criticized loans decreased and the criticized loan ratio improved basis points special mention loans decreased largely from upgrades of cre loans largely hotel loans due to improvements in financial performance and liquidity classified loans were essentially unchanged as of september nonperforming assets were million or basis points of assets during the third quarter we booked net chargeoffs of million or a low basis points of average loans annualized compared with net recoveries of basis points annualized in the second quarter our allowance totaled million as of september or of loans compared with of loans as of june during the third quarter we reported a provision for credit losses of million compared to million for the second quarter our quarteroverquarter build and reserve and allowance coverage largely reflects the current macroeconomic outlook which is weaker than a quarter ago as well as third quarter loan growth while credit quality remains strong and the current credit environment is benign we are watchful of various challenges affecting the economy and our customers taking proactive actions where warranted including conservatively building our allowance and now moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides of note amortization of tax credit and other investments in the third quarter was million compared with million in the second quarter this is lower than what we had previously anticipated because of timing certain tax credit projects are delayed and the recognition of the associated amortization expense will be in the fourth quarter accordingly we currently expect the amortization of tax credit and other investment expense to be approximately million in the fourth quarter third quarter income tax expense was million compared with income tax expense of million for the second quarter of yeartodate the effective tax rate for the first nine months of was we currently expect that the fullyear effective tax rate will be approximately including the impact of tax credit investments expected in the fourth quarter ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with the average balance sheet third quarter average loans of billion grew billion or annualized the strong growth across all loan categories drove a favorable mix shift in average earning assets quarterover quarter in the third quarter average loans made up of average earning assets compared with in the prior quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 third quarter average deposits of billion declined only million quarteroverquarter remaining essentially flat growth and interestbearing deposits nearly offset the decrease in demand deposits as some customers shifted excess balances to higher yielding options reflecting market dynamics and a rising interest rate environment average noninterestbearing deposits held up and made up of total deposits in the third quarter turning to slide third quarter net interest income of million is the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing linkedquarter annualized the net interest margin of expanded by basis points quarteroverquarter as you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide net interest margin expansion in the third quarter reflected the impact of higher loan and earning asset yields which increased the nim by basis points plus a favorable earning asset mix shift which expanded the nim by basis points this was partially offset by basis points of compression from the funding side turning to slide the second quarter average loan yield was an increase of basis points quarter overquarter the average loan yield comprised an average coupon yield of plus yield adjustments which contributed basis points to the overall loan yield in the third quarter as of september the spot coupon rate on our loans was in this slide we also present the coupon spot yield for each major loan portfolio through the last four quarterend periods you can see the positive impact of rising interest rates on each loan portfolio as loans are repricing in total of our loan proposal is variable rate including linked to prime rate and linked to libor or sofr rates most of the loans reprice at least monthly i would also highlight that of our variable rate cre loans have customerlevel interest rate derivative contracts in place we will help our customers enter into low level interest rate derivatives helping to protect them against rising debt service costs at the same time the loans remain variable rate on our balance sheet and the big benefits from the asset sensitivity additionally billion of the of variable rate ci loans also have derivative contracts in place turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the third quarter was basis points up basis points from the second quarter our spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of september a yeartodate increase of basis points this translates to a cumulative beta relative to the 300basispoint increase in the target fed funds rate over the same period in comparison the cumulative beta on our loans has been as our loan coupon spot rates increased basis points yeartodate we started the rising interest rate cycle from the position of strength with historically high levels of demand deposits for east west bank and strong liquidity this has bolstered the asset sensitivity benefits of our variable rate loan and securities portfolios supporting strong revenue growth through the cycle as rates continue to rise were pleased with the lag and deposit beta cycle todate this has come through careful deposit cost management as rates continue to rise we believe our approach will continue to support an expanding net interest margin and robust net interest income growth in the coming new year with of our average deposit to noninterestbearing accounts and with the growth that we have had in treasury management products and annualized accounts since before the pandemic we feel comfortable about continuing to navigate the cycle well moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the third quarter was million down from million in the second quarter customerdriven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were million up east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 or annualized from the second quarter and up yearoveryear we saw growth across most of the fee income lines of business this quarter moving to slide third quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the third quarter up million or sequentially driven by higher compensation and employee benefits expense in comparison our sequential total revenue growth was exceeding expense growth and generating positive operating leverage quarteroverquarter our efficiency improved third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the second quarter our adjusted pretax preprovision income grew sequentially or annualized and our pretax preprovision roa was an attractive in the third quarter and with that ill now review our updated outlook for the full year of on slide for the full year compared to our fullyear results we currently expect yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp of approximately to unchanged from our prior outlook yearoveryear net interest income growth excluding ppp of approximately this narrows down to the upper end of our prior outlook which was for net interest income growth ranging from to underpinning our interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as of september with fed funds expected to reach by yearend adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization of approximately year overyear which is a slight increase from our previous outlook with our strong revenue growth we expect positive operating leverage and modestly improving efficiency next quarter for the full year we now expect that the provision for credit losses will be approximately million this is up from our previous outlook and largely reflects the changed macroeconomic backdrop compared with a quarter ago we currently expect that the full year effective tax rate will be approximately thats slightly higher than our previous outlook which was for an effective tax rate of the change in our outlook reflects higher pretax income and a lower amount of tax credit investment as compared with our previous forecast we currently expect that the fourth quarter tax credit investment amortization expense will be approximately million with that ill now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing we are looking forward to finishing on a high note our strong operating margins and capital give us the confidence that we will navigate the emerging and changing economic cycle well i wish to thank all of our dedicated bankers for their excellent work which is reflected in our strong financial performance i will now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions in the interest of time please limit yourself to one question and one followup at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster the first question today comes from with ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just maybe first question just around deposit obviously a lot of focus in terms of client behavior and given the rising rates the loantodeposit ratio has crept up one maybe just talk about how high you think that loan todeposit ratio going before you start being more active in terms of managing deposits and second how does this translate into where you think the margin peaks and for east west would that also mark a little bit of a peak in nii or do you expect nii growth to continue until driven by loan growth irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc there are lot of questions there ebrahim i dont know if i remember them all but ill try to get through that im sorry its early for me here okay so if we look at im going to start with i think the end of your question which probably the more important one given where things are at right now we do expect the margin will continue to grow from here right we expect it to grow in the fourth quarter and when we look yearoveryear we also expect a margin and net interest income to increase in we wont go into guidance and specifics around that but i just wanted to make sure that that was very clear right even though the we do expect that deposit betas will increase and have continued to increase you saw that a little in the third quarter results with that said from our loan book and our securities book the increase that were seeing and the pickup were seeing there far outpaces that i think on the question about the deposit and the loantodeposit ratio we ended the quarter at a little under that from an average perspective or so we do feel comfortable increasing from this point in time i dont think that we have said publicly in the past and that still is our position right now our core funding is very strong and i think going to kind of the low is something that were comfortable with ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 got it and i guess just a separate question you talked about the hedging that your customers have done but talk to us if we are heading into a recession where you see the biggest drivers of credit risk for east wests loan book irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think at this point in time so the hedging i think honestly for us its been a balance sheet management strategy in this period of time until this year when rates were so low but certainly we wanted to share that that it certainly protects our customers in this period of time because the debt service is easier for cre for multifamily also for ci loans on the credit side at this point in time credit is still very benign we certainly if you look at kind of the results that we have in the third quarter criticized loans are down chargeoffs are still very benign as we look through the portfolios i wouldnt say theres an area that were really concerned with from a credit perspective but we continue to monitor and continue to evaluate our portfolio dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think from a macroeconomic perspective thats why we have increased our provision simply because with this kind of spike in interest rate one would expect that the economy will slow down and so therefore we are anticipating maybe things are going to slow down and however we just havent seen much in terms from a credit quality issue at this point everything seems to look pretty good as you see that our criticized asset actually come down and then so forth operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning irene i want to circle back to the nii question just i think thats part of the reason your stocks weak this morning the nii guide the implied guide for q4 can you just put a little bit more of a clarity around it because the billion that you cite as a starting point your actual number is a little bit lower than that excluding ppp i just wanted to get a little bit of a fine tune on the fourth quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well i think when we look at the fourth quarter maybe ill just share a little bit more specifics right with the based on the forward curve at if you kind of break it down and maybe this will help you chris in kind of the analysis we expect the loan yield to continue to increase right maybe not the same pace of the increase that we saw in the fourth indiscernible but close to that on the securities side based on the variable rate and the nature of the portfolio probably another to basis points right in total especially if you look at it from a nim perspective nii i think the timing of the increase in the cost of deposits is something where were modeling that the deposit betas will continue to increase and weve been very fortunate as weve talked about in our prepared remarks of the lag but i think were just realistic as rates continue to increase than they inch up bu overall i think the guidance that we gave and the specifics as far as nii growth at that higher end of that range is a number that were comfortable with at this point of time east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i guess as my followup just again going back to the billion is that thats the starting point or is it like billion sorry to get this in the weeds but theres a big difference in the implied trajectory im trying to get a sense of whether nii into q1 will grow off of the q4 number that were talking about julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc this is julianna if i can jump in with the precision level that you are looking for guidance that has the word approximately in it if you start with the billion starting point from a increase on that implies an nii growth of million but an nii increase of off of that implies nii growth of million right now we put in the word approximately because quite frankly whether its going to be or right now impossible for us to tell given the fact that some of the things such as deposit betas you cannot know two months in advance but what we are comfortable telling you is that we are hitting at the upper end of our guidance and were moving higher as were talking about because as irene said we expect our nii to continue to grow but in terms of the actual precision that unfortunately from where we sit we cannot provide that level of detail so just take the word approximately and use your judgment operator the next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead clark wright q analyst d a davidson co hi there this is clark wright on for gary tenner this morning i just had some thoughts on capital or excuse me some questions i mean in terms of the buyback the stock is now trading below where you repurchased in how are you thinking about the buyback here moving forward into kind of economic headwinds and a revised economic outlook dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc at this point we dont anticipate to do any buyback simply because we are looking at that macroeconomic situation with the fed making this unprecedented like ate spike that i think it would be prudent for us to hold on to our very very healthy capital ratio the great thing about where we are today is when we looked at east west incredible earnings power very high margin high liquidity benign credit quality issue very strong capital ratio east west have always done well whenever economic cycle go down thats where we actually make most of our money well were very proud of our financial performance for the first three quarters so far however i think we will be even prouder if actual economy situation get worse simply because we always have a very strong balance sheet that allow us to have all the flexibility to do whatever we want so thats the reason why we have always been somewhat stingy in terms of not wanting to do too much buyback because having all the dry powder in place in a downcycle may be much more advantageous for us clark wright q analyst d a davidson co east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 got it thank you and then if i could just pivot over to loan growth in your outlook where are your thoughts on the mix heading into you had strong singlefamily growth here this quarter but just in terms of cre and ci where is that going to be going in at what are kind of your thoughts heading into the next year dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we obviously expect loan growth to slow down compared with or simply because with that kind of rate environment naturally well expect that investors may not or business enterprises are not going to go in there and start making aggressive acquisition of lets say commercial real estate investment or building apartments buying warehouses a lot of those activities that were taking place in a much more normal interest rate environment looking at in the early part of i would expect that those type of activities would slow down massively sort of like increasing inventory is also something that i would say most likely out of the question so with that we will expect the ci and cre growth will most likely be coming down so we will provide guidance in the actual at the time well release our fourth quarter earnings when it comes to residential mortgages we are also expecting somewhat of a slowdown simply that i would expect that there would not be as much refinancing or even home purchases but as of today were still seeing pipeline both ci cre and also in singlefamily mortgages while we are seeing those numbers in the pipeline report that feel very positive about it we also are very prudent and looking at the macroeconomic situation and the interest rate environment coming forward and we are taking a more conservative outlook in terms of what it may be operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody and i guess first just on back on the deposits whats your expectation for sort of a throughcycle beta on deposits and does that assume that dda stays roughly stable as a percentage of the total irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question when earlier in the year i think we shared that given the expectation for where rates were and where the fed was moving that we thought our throughcycle betas for deposits would be about as a reminder in the last cycle although a very different cycle ill add our throughcycle data was as we shared on the details of the presentation cumulatively our cumulative beta todate has been quite a bit of a lag and then also but up right from where we were at which was at this point in time given the pace of the rate increases from the fed we do expect that the throughcycle deposit betas will increase from that more specifics as far as whats happening next year as dominic mentioned well share next year but ill also add that with that said we expect the loan betas to continue to increase and there will still be significant nii expansion jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 okay okay thats good color thanks and then looking at the allowance for loan loss and the growth this quarter should we think that the ratio of allowance to loans can continue to march up if we dont see a significant change in the economy or that really be more dependent upon either portfolio performance or incremental deterioration from here irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question i think so when we look at our models largely the drivers for the models are gdp growth unemployment cpi cre and market dynamics in the areas where we have cre loans and also for the single family heloc also hpi as these deteriorate or change we are appropriately booking the reserve i think if there are at this point in time as we talked about earlier theres no major weaknesses that we see but we want to just be realistic and prudent especially with where the calculations are for allowance to increase as appropriate that macroeconomic factors decrease that was one of the reasons for the increase in the allowance of basis points ill share of the million that we booked approximately million was related to the new loan growth that we had in the quarter julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc and if i can add jared to your prior question about the deposit betas that irene was answering one of your questions was about the deposit mix let me just highlight that before the pandemic we were at dda at the end of today were at dda we do not think were going to go back to the prepandemic levels we are confident were going to be above prepandemic because of the growth in dda has come from operating accounts treasury management products and services linked accounts so we have a much stronger deposit mix than last cycle dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc and also i want to add that those accounts come from a lot of new customers or existing customers that used to use other bank for operating accounts because we did not offer the services thats because east west bank had improved gts product offerings that we are able to transition many of these east west bank clients to move their operating accounts from other larger banks to us so the last two years that operating accounts growth has been quite phenomenal in fact it reflects even on some of the gts fee income growth there too operator operator instructions the next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 yes so i was curious if you can give us an update on kind of the plan strategically as far as potentially locking in your rate sensitivity for the balance sheet and protecting against the downside of rates potentially in the future irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc brandon it came in and out would you mind repeating your question im sorry i didnt quite catch it brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yes yes i was curious if you can update us on your plan or thoughts on potentially locking in the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet against kind of falling rates into the in the future irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc oh okay great we have increased kind of our balance sheet hedging strategy with our asset sensitivity as you noted trying to walk in i think those are great words our asset sensitivity so i can share that as of well actually we entered into trade just after as well so as of today we have about billion of hedges and also collars that we have entered into to help preserve our margin and our nii if and when rates fall and thats something that well continue to evaluate looking at with our alco committee as far as whats appropriate given the asset sensitivity and the balance sheet of the bank brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got you and if you dont mind sharing what is kind of the duration of those hedges and collars irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc they range i think four to five years brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic for any closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer
