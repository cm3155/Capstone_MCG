quarter results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with some second quarter highlights we earned billion in the second quarter our results included a million impairment of equity securities predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions revenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower noninterest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital mortgage banking investment banking and wealth management advisory businesses we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses we have broadbased loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago credit performance remained strong our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth while were monitoring risks related to continued high inflation increasing interest rates and the slowing economy which will impact our customers consumers and businesses have been resilient so far when looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above prepandemic levels wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 overall our consumer deposit customers helped indicators including cash flow payroll and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns however were closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers we have seen average balances steadily decline to prepandemic levels following the final federal stimulus payments early last year and their debit card spend has also been declining overall debit card spending was up compared to a year ago when consumers received stimulus payments and inflation appears to be impacting certain categories of spending including a increase in fuel driven by higher prices while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits driven by fewer transactions credit card spend increased from a year ago above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year with doubledigit increases across all spend categories however spending while still strong started to slow in may and june consumer credit card utilization rates remained below prepandemic levels payment rates remain strong and delinquency rates remain low our small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses leading indicators such as payment rates deposit levels utilization and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress loan demand from our commercial customers remained strong with broadbased balance and commitment growth our commercial customers credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net chargeoffs and nonaccrual loans were at their lowest level in over years however we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts now let me update you on progress weve made on our strategic priorities our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth this week we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year wells fargo autograph our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over from a year ago were focused on delivering competitive offerings and our new reward card provides three times points across top spending categories including restaurants travel and gas stations this is the first of several rewardsbased cards we plan to introduce we continued to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of intuitive investor our automated digital investing platform we simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors during the second quarter we began rolling out wells fargo premier which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships we are working towards offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses we will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for premier clients we started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter which included the elimination of fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a new easy shortterm credit product we expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 overdraft fees and meet shortterm cash needs and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances we also continued to invest to better serve our commercial customers and early in the second quarter tim ohara joined corporate investment bank sic corporate investment bank from blackrock as head of banking tims expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients and he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses who have helped us navigate recent market volatility we believe we have significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance we also believe that for us to be successful as a company we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions last week we announced that otis rolley will be joining wells fargo from the rockefeller foundation as the head of social impact leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy including the wells fargo foundation we continue to move forward in the area of esg with the announcement of our reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors as homeownership remains out of reach for too many families we announced an effort to support new home construction renovation and repair of more than affordable homes across the us in collaboration with habitat for humanity and rebuilding together we also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that wells fargo currently services we continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty including launching the small business resource navigator which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country we are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for womenowned businesses through the connect to more program with complementary mentorship opportunities we published our inaugural diversity equity and inclusion report which highlights the meaningful positive results weve made on our dei initiatives for example in the us our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by in compared to and approximately onethird of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse as ive said in the past advancing dei at wells fargo is a longterm commitment not a project and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact let me just make some summary comments before turning it over to mike the federal reserves commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy which will impact our consumer and commercial customers despite the economic environment i remain optimistic about our future credit quality remains strong and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates which should more than offset any further nearterm pressure on noninterest income we remain on target to achieve a sustainable rotce subject to the same assumptions weve discussed in the past on a runrate basis in the second half of this year and then we will discuss our path to this years federal reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases as we previously announced we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 with per share subject to approval by the companys board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month i will now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks charlie and good morning everyone net income for the quarter was billion or per common share which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates our results included a million impairment of equity securities predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions which drove a total loss from equity securities of million in the second quarter recall that a year ago when the markets were strong our results included billion of gains on equity securities while credit quality remains strong our results included a million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth this follows six consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance including billion in the first quarter and billion a year ago we highlight capital on slide our cet1 ratio was down approximately basis points from the first quarter as declines in aoci and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings our cet1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and riskweighted assets as well as reduce our aoci sensitivity by moving more securities to heldtomaturity and hedging securities in our availableforsale portfolio additionally we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter but as charlie highlighted the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases we will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions including interest rate volatility potential loan and riskweighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters our cet1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers as a reminder based on the recent federal stress test our stress capital buffer for october to september is expected to be which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by basis points to turning to credit quality on slide our chargeoff ratio remained near historical lows and was only basis points in the second quarter as we previously discussed losses are not expected to remain at these low levels and we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting commercial credit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses with only two basis points of net chargeoffs in the second quarter which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio we also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios and total consumer net chargeoffs declined slightly from the first quarter to basis points of average loans as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses nonperforming assets decreased million or from the first quarter lower levels of consumer nonaccruals were driven by declines in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting covidrelated accommodation programs commercial nonaccruals continue to decline and as charlie highlighted were at the lowest levels in over years our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflect a continued strong credit performance with an increase that was due to loan growth on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans grew from a year ago and from the first quarter period end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up from a year ago with wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios ill highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago and basis points from the first quarter reflecting benefit of higher rates average deposits increased billion or from a yearago with growth in consumer banking and lending offsetting declines across our other operating segments the decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients our average deposit costs increased basis point from the first quarter driven by corporate investment banking as ive previously highlighted we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from loweryielding to higheryielding deposit products would likely increase as well turning to net interest income on slide second quarter net interest income increased billion or from a year ago and million or from the first quarter the growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization for mortgage backed securities we also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter we started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately compared with last quarter we raised our guidance to an increase in the midteens with the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones we currently expect net interest income in to increase approximately from and as a reminder net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors including the magnitude and timing of fed rate increases deposit betas and loan growth on slide on noninterest income this quarter we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by two cyclical businesses mortgage banking which has slowed in response to higher interest rates and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions while all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts it was actually up slightly from the first quarter the decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last years divestitures turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the runrate and we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives operating losses increased million from a year ago and primarily driven by increased litigation expense which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year and higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters customer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact while weve made progress we have more to do to resolve the remaining items were halfway through the year and while weve had higher operating losses than we expected revenuerelated expenses are trending lower than expected our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress were making on our efficiency initiatives with lower head count and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense we expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives putting all these factors together we still expect our full year expenses to be approximately billion as lower revenuerelated expense is expected to offset higher operating losses but as a reminder we have outstanding litigation regulatory matters and customer remediations and the related expenses could be significant and are hard to predict which could cause us to exceed our billion outlook wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances our deposit pricing has been stable but we expect deposit betas to increase over time as charlie highlighted depositrelated fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter which included the elimination of fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year which will further reduce deposit related fees home lending revenue declined from a year ago and from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins given the higherrate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry after increasing over basis points in the first quarter mortgage rates increased over basis points in the second quarter the impact of higherrates also reduced revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools the mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term and its possible that it will further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter we are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple quarters credit card revenue was up auto revenue increased and personal lending was up from a year ago primarily due to higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide our mortgage originations declined from the first quarter with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to average home lending loan balances grew from the first quarter driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or epbos turning to auto origination volume declined from a year ago and from the first quarter due to increased pricing competition credit tightening actions and an ongoing industry supply pressures turning to debit card while debit card spend increased transactions were relatively flat from a year ago as increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement credit card pointofsale purchase volume was up from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment the increase in pointofsale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a increase in credit card balances from a year ago we remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher loan balances noninterest expense increased from a year ago primarily driven by higher operating costs efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with head count down from a year ago average loan balances have grown for four consecutive quarters and were up from a year ago utilization rates continue to increase but they still arent back to historical levels clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth both of which have been impacted by higher inflation we also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods loan growth was driven by the larger clients average deposits declined from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap deposit pricing has been relatively stable but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase turning to corporate investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances investment banking fees declined reflecting lower market activity and million writedown on wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 unfunded leverage finance commitments due to the market spread widening average loan balances were up from a year ago with broadbased loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures commercial real estate revenues grew from a year ago driven by loan growth and higher interest rates average loan balances were up from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization markets revenue increased from a year ago primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients positioned themselves for rising rates quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading average deposits in corporate investment banking were down from a year ago driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap theres been more deposit pricing pressure in corporate banking than weve seen in commercial banking on slide wealth and investment management revenue grew from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset based fees driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of april and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of july the sp and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter and approximately two thirds of our advisory assets are in equities so there will be another stepdown in our assetbased fees next quarter average loans increased from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securitiesbased lending average deposits declined from a year ago and were down from the first quarter as clients reallocated cash into higheryielding alternatives deposit pricing increased modestly slide highlights our corporate results both revenue and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our corporate trust services business and wells fargo asset management and the sale of student loan portfolio these businesses contributed million of revenue in the second quarter of including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio and they accounted for approximately million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago including the goodwill write down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio the decline in revenue in corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses in summary while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital mortgage banking results our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances as we look ahead to the second half of the year we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on noninterest income while we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress as i highlighted earlier our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier finally our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders including the expected increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open sir ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thanks good morning guys appreciate the continuity of the expense guide and also the potential variability mike i was just wondering if you could expand on that obviously the operating losses are hanging higher this year than they had been so just wondering how you start to get a sense of what those look like going forward and then also just the underlying as you mentioned coming in better because of revenue just any sense of also how your net saves are looking underneath the surface as well thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah hey thanks ken first id start with the efficiency program that weve been talking about now for the better part of the yearandahalf and all of thats tracking as we thought it would so the core driving kind of efficiency through the core business lines and operating groups is sort of working the way we thought when you look at whats happened this year as you pointed out operating losses are higher than what we assumed at the beginning of the year and those things just can be unpredictable at times just as we work through the backlog of items you know the accounting standard we work with though right if we knew about something now we would accrue for it and if we could estimate it we would accrue for it but were just continuing to flag that we still had a pipeline of stuff to work through and then as you highlighted as we think about this year the increases and the operating loss line have been offset by largely offset by the lower revenuerelated expense and so we still feel good about that billion number that we set out at the beginning of the year and were going to continue to work through the pipeline of items and if something is significant and possibly we will be sure to highlight it as we go forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah and as a followup i know as you guys talked to in recent conference season its hard to get a crystal ball with so many moving parts as you think about but can you just help us try to at least start to think through some of the pushes and takes and can you continue to push us towards getting costs down next year thanks guys charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey ken this is charlie let me take that the way we think about it as we sit and look towards next year we certainly know we have some increases to contend with such as the full year impact of inflationary pressures that we see this year and we know weve got some increases in fdic insurance premiums but as we start thinking about next year and were really just starting the budget process our mindset going into it is that we have significant opportunities to become more efficient weve been and its just more of the same in terms of what weve been talking about and this has nothing to do with getting efficiencies out of the riskrelated work it wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 assumes that all of that investment continues but we do go into this process with the expectation that we want to see net expense reductions now just usual caveats that excludes revenuerelated expenses which could go up or some of the lumpiness that weve talked about just as we think but as we think about that core expense base we do continue to see opportunities and wed like you to see it as well operator thank you the next question comes from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning guys wanted to ask about capital it looks like youre entering now next quarter with over basis points buffer to your pro forma reg minimums how should we think about where youll manage capital to and your potential buyback capacity going forward and given that you paused for scb partly because of scb uncertainty will you get to some level of buybacks likely moving forward here thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah hey john its charlie why dont i start and then mike can chime in yeah i think youre no question clarity of scb for us at this point does really help as we sit here today and we look at whats happening in spreads and whats happening with the 10year whats at right now we do want to be a little bit just conservative in terms of how we think about managing the capital base so just to be i think to be clear as we sit here today were very happy with the amount of capital that we have including as we think about that basis points increase that will impact us we certainly have capacity to buy shares back at this point and as i think mike alluded to we just probably want to wait a little bit just to see what happens in terms of the volatility in spreads and rates before we start to do that but we certainly at point will do it well just see exactly when that is michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and maybe ill just add one or two things john i think as charlie highlighted we feel good about where we are i would just point out we are not our gsib score is going to stay the same as we go into next year as well so we dont have another uptick as we go into the beginning of next year so thats good and at this point we dont feel like we need to build capital from where we are to build a bigger buffer and then well just be prudent on buybacks as we go through and through the next few quarters john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and mike maybe i can ask a followup on the nii revised outlook what kind of cadence do you see between the next two quarters it seems like youd have big stepups both this coming quarter and the third quarter and then again in the fourth and then within that nii equation you still have this funding gap between loan growth being very strong and deposit growth slowing is there still plenty of cash to use to fund the loan growth thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 yeah sure i think ultimately the exact progression over the next couple quarters will be a function of how the fed moves on rates but i would think of it as somewhat of a ratable stepup quartertoquarter so not you wont see some outsized results in one versus the other as we go and youll continue to see a little bit of loan growth come through we think that probably moderates a little bit from what we saw in the first half of the year but youll see loan growth there as well as it steps up and as you say i think the industry is seeing deposits come down a little bit if you look at the latest version of the fed data and you can see that in our results as well now for us its been a little bit you can see the periodend balances in each of the segments and its been a little bit of a reduction in each of them with the lowest percentage reduction being in the consumer space so thats a good thing and then as you know over the last couple of years weve brought down much of our wholesale funding that weve got out there and so weve got plenty of capacity to provide liquidity or to get the liquidity we need to continue to support clients john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research so that loan growth funding is coming from your cash balances and other sources of liquidity that you have michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes exactly john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks operator thank you the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open sir steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so wanted to start off with a question just clarifying some of the nii guidance mike because you noted that its a ratable stepup and its implying the guidance implies about a billion runrate at least in the back half for nii on an fte basis is it reasonable for us to assume or expect that the exit rate for the year is going to be north of billion i just wanted to make sure to clarify that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well steve i know youre really good at modeling this stuff so ill let you do the modeling but i think as you pointed out were going to see stepups right as we go through the next as we did this quarter from last quarter and thatll continue into the third and fourth quarter and now exactly what its hard to use one quarter as you know to just runrate for the following year but certainly the exit rates going to be a lot higher than even where we are today and then well have to just see what the environment is like at that point to know how to think about whether thats a clean runrate to build off of or if there are other things that get in the way and as you can see over the last even over the last three four five six weeks whatever its been the amount of volatility thats out there on the longend and what happens with loan growth does it keep at the same pace and so theres a lot of factors i think that go into what would look like but as you pointed out our exit rate will be pretty healthy wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that mike and just for one followup also on the nii guide just wanted to get a better sense as to whats being contemplated in terms of deposit beta the deposit beta and repricing just came in much better than beers this quarter youve cited the benefits of the deposit and funding optimization youve executed these past few years just want to get a sense as to how youre thinking about that deposit trajectory thats underpinning some of the nii guidance michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean i think thats were not expecting balances to grow much from where they are and i think well see what happens as if we see continued outflows of deposits but as you pointed out like our mix of deposits as we came in this environment sets us up pretty well and you can see that in results so far where the consumer deposits are a much bigger percentage of the overall pie than they were just a couple of years ago and as you sort of think about betas so far theyve basically progressed as we thought in each of the segments and so we really havent seen much variation to what we thought at this point in the rate cycle now if the fed does raise rates basis points at the next meeting now youre starting to get into territory that we didnt see at the last rate cycle rate rising cycle and so were going to start to see betas increase from there and i think thats exactly at what pace and where you need to be defensive or not on the wholesale side of the and the commercial side well see and were pretty nimble and are able to react to it but so far everythings progressed as we thought it would and so were going to keep a pretty close eye on it as we go over the next few months and i think thatll this quarter and into the fourth quarter i think will give us a lot of interesting data points to know how to think about it over a longer period of time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great color thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question just as it relates to revenues overall so the nii trajectory obviously quite strong and in a sense seems mostly selfevident for now but i was hoping mike you could discuss please sort of the fee trajectory in a bit more detail i guess were kind of hovering in a billion or billion a quarter range if we exclude some of that noise from the equity marks the securities gain et cetera in your mind are we sort of at a low and can we grow from that base i know you touched on mortgage maybe coming down and then weve got wealth but just sort of puts and takes as you see that if you could please michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure thanks scott ill just bring you through some of the key fee lines just to give you a sense of some of the dynamics right so on the deposit side its been pretty we saw a stepdown in the quarter largely a result of the changes we made in overdraft fees well see a little bit more stepdown as we go through the year probably more a fourth quarter thing than a third quarter thing as we implemented the additional changes there wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 but other than that theres a lot of stability generally to that line based on underlying activity well see what happens in the market and how that drives the investment advisory and assetbased fee line its going to be key to see what happens in the equity and the fixed income markets and as we bring as more stability enters into the market that really supports that fee line as you know thats our singlebiggest line item as you look at that fees investment banking its really going to be marketdriven but our fees were pretty low including the small mark that we had in leverage finance and so its hard to see that going too much lower but that really going to be driven by the activity levels card spend were seeing still good although its slowed maybe a little in may and june were still seeing really good activity in the card space and people are out spending so thats helpful mortgage banking as you highlighted i think is likely going to come down a little more in the third quarter but its off a much smaller base so you can still have decent size percentage declines there but its still really small dollars at this point and then well see as the market progresses and how that impacts the equity security side but so i think hopefully were getting more stability here but some of it will be dependent upon what we see in the markets r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect thank you very much and if i could just switch gears just a bit back to ccar and the scb i guess its possible i had sort of misinterpreted your guys remarks over the last few quarters but i sort of felt like you guys were maybe prepping us for possibly a somewhat worse outcome in terms of where the scb would flush out in your mind how did that ccar and that scb just because it barely budged right so how did that all flush out relative to what you guys have kind of been anticipating michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah what we said a couple times was that we thought it was possible that it was going to increase and it did now you have to keep in mind like we only have so much visibility into the underlying drivers of what causes it to go up or down in any given year now theres a lot of stuff thats public but theres also a lot of the modeling techniques that arent quite easy to understand and so i would say we were pleased with the result weve spent as many do probably we spend a lot of time trying to understand the drivers of the risk of the balance sheet and do our best to position ourselves for good outcomes and so we were pleased ph thats working out r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks perfect thank you guys very much i appreciate it operator thank you the next question comes from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey john good morning wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi just on the deposit front just to go back to that i just want to confirm so from here your best estimate now is that the overall deposit balances are relatively stable in the back half of the year or do you think you could see some incremental declines just as betas are rising michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think you could certainly see a little bit more decline from here potentially i think thats not an unreasonable expectation exactly timing and how thats going to progress i think is hard to predict with any real degree of accuracy just given the environment were in right now but i think its possible they come down a little bit more from here john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks mike and then on the credit front i want to get your thoughts on the likelihood of reserve build i know you added some reserve for loan growth this quarter but in terms of an overall build of the reserve as you from a cecl perspective as you look at your economic scenarios where do you see this quarter with your cecl scenarios that didnt warrant a sizable build and i guess longerterm as this plays out and we see the fed continue with the tightening what do you view as a potential level that you may have to bring the reserve to is the pandemic level too high and if you can help us with the magnitude there michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well as you think about the process we go through which i think is similar to most in a lot of ways is youre really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling and weve now for a number of quarters in a row have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already and some of those scenarios are pretty severe right and so youve got weightings on what some might term mild recessions more severe recessions you could create a lot of labels for them but its a number of scenarios that have different severity of downside and so we feel at this point that weve captured what we can look at and see or anticipate at this point based on all the factors that we need to evaluate in our current reserve and ill just point out also if you look at us in the position were in yet we didnt take down all of the reserves that we put up during covid and so as you sort of look through each of the underlying asset classes we feel what we have today is appropriate its hard to see in the near term increasing them to the level that we had back in the pandemic but i think thats a hard thing to see at this point but i think well have to make sure as things evolve throughout the next couple quarters well have to incorporate that but again we already have a pretty significant weighting on those downside scenarios already and its a very as you would imagine a very robust conversation that we go through each quarter to evaluate how we feel about it and at this point we feel its appropriate for what we can see over the life of those loans john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right and one more related to credit quickly the million writedown in unfunded leverage finance commitments that you took is there risk of future marks there is that primarily just predicated on market spreads and then separately what is your can you remind us whats your total leverage loan exposure both in terms of commitments and outright outstandings thanks wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah you got to think of these as unfunded commitments not funded right so as you sort of think about them dont think about them outstanding think about them as unfunded commitments thats number one and you really have to over time think about term loans versus highyield a little bit differently and on the highyield side we dont disclose we havent disclosed the actual number but its really small in the scheme of the balance sheet and the term loan side which generally has a little bit more stability to it and less volatility to it is the bigger part all these deals are subject to further spread widening given the environment were in for sure we at the end of the quarter took our best used our best judgment to market where we thought the deals would clear and well see how that goes over the coming months john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks mike operator thank you the next question comes from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just had one more followup question and mike i apologize if this is the umpteenth question on nii appreciate all your color in terms of whats driving the nii guide at im wondering if you could better quantify the deposit beta that you would expect by yearend on a cumulative basis appreciate that you said it would accelerate but given that some of your peers have given specific guides and given how much the quality of your deposit base has changed for the better over the past several years im wondering if you could give us a sense of what that beta range that youre assuming by yearend on a cumulative basis that underpins that guide michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah erika i think thats a really hard thing to give a pinpoint number on at this point in the cycle to be honest with you and if you think about and its just theres so many moving pieces right now i think between and particularly as you sort of get to the yearend and the pace of rates and what exactly is the fed going to do and when are they going to do it and so i think theres a lot that goes into that that trying to get a one number is a hard thing to say with a lot of confidence in my view i think what we can say though is as you look at the next couple rate rises i think youre going to start to see more acceleration in the retail and the consumer side the core deposit the core rates havent changed much for the big banks at this point yet so youll start to see that happen over the next couple rate rises the betas will still be pretty small however that will start to pick up depending on how fast the fed goes by yearend and then i think on the other side of the spectrum on the corporate investment bank and those deposits whether its in the fi space or the large corporate space youre seeing those betas pick up a lot already and so those will continue to accelerate and so when you look at cumulative betas you really have to look at and you start to compare different banks youre really going to have to look at the mix of the deposits and the cib deposits are just a much smaller piece of the pie for us right now and those are going to those will probably move faster than even weve modeled but its a small piece of it so i think well see how it goes and well give you as much insight as we can but i think trying to predict cumulative betas by yearend is hard wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it i understand thanks so much operator thank you the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning operator from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning just following up on that mike so appreciate you dont want to get pinned down on deposit beta but is it fair for us to assume just given the mix shift in deposits given how you managed the balance sheet during the pandemic we should see your deposit beta at least track inline or maybe even lower relative to the last rate cycle michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think as you think about each asset each type of deposit to date theyre tracking pretty close to what we saw last cycle but then you look at the mix of our deposit base and thats whats changed pretty substantially since the last goaround and so if betas stayed the same as last cycle byproduct given our mix has changed you would see a lower average deposit beta but theres a lot to play out as we go through the rest of the year in each of the underlying products ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats fair just wanted to make sure we werent missing something because there are peers who probably are expecting a higher beta than last cycle so just wanted to hear you talk through that and as a followup and i know these are extremely tough in terms of when we think about the private market valuations on your equity investments but give us a sense of just where their markets are in terms of taking these markdowns should we anticipate some more negative marks in a world where theres no big turnaround in equity markets over the next few quarters just want to make sure like expectations are level set for that line and how that impacts fees and ppnr michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure look and again it really all depends on what happens in the public equity markets which is in part driving those declines if we see some stabilization thats constructive if we see much deeper declines thats well have to evaluate how that impacts these portfolio investments and obviously if the market starts to rally thats even more constructive so i think the public equity markets will be a good guide to how to think about whether or not we have to evaluate whether theres more reductions here or not wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and looks like were tracking to a ph drop say maybe by the end of the year that was a statement i dont expect you to respond thanks for taking my questions michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co no problem im glad you made it rhetorical operator thank you the next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning charlie good morning mike mike can you give us some color on you guys had some good success in the quarter in generating gains from your trading activities and your debt securities can you just share with us what drove that and what your expectations might be in the next quarter or two michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean on the trading side it was really good performance in our macro fixed income businesses commodities fx a little bit of rates and so i think thats probably what contributed to it and well see obviously the continued performance there is subject to what we see happening in the markets were not out there taking any kind of incremental risk than we normally take its really helping clients facilitate the flow that theyve got there and so well see how that goes and as you can see its a relatively smaller number for us versus maybe some others as you think about the securities portfolio i wouldnt assume there will be continued gains there i think we did do some small remixing of our securities portfolio some of it was rwa some of it was rwa optimization i think selling some umbs is buying ginnies that where spreads were pretty tight at the time we did it you save an rwa you dont give up much yield and there are a few other minor optimizations we did there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question when it comes to your professional and outside services expenses can you frame it out for us how much of that is tied to your current working with the regulators to lift the asset cap in the cease and desist order and when that day eventually arrives will the professional and outside services numbers really have a kind of a meaningful downward move because youve resolved that issue charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co this is charlie let me just take a shot at this first listen i think we have the work were doing on all of the risk and infrastructure work which supports the regulatory matters its our own head count its professional its a bunch of technology work it really cuts across a whole series of lines and i just dont really think its the right time for us to start even talking about where those saves could come from and its just genuinely not on our radar screen in terms of what were thinking about where its going to go or anything like that so id rather just defer the question at this point wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no problem understood and then mike just coming back to your comment about the mix of deposits and this is a rhetorical question as well as we see for the first time in years consumer deposits at a higher rate environment will make guys like you guys stand out maybe over some of your peers so good luck with that thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks gerard operator thank you the next question will come from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey betsy charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc charlie i think you recently mentioned that youre in the process of strategically thinking about where mortgage fits in and i guess i wanted to understand what kind of framework youre assessing mortgage under what youre thinking about that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure yeah and that was by the way not meant to be a new comment thats something that weve been doing ever since i got here and we brought a new management including kristy fercho who runs the business i mean if you just go back and look at how big we were in the mortgage business we were a hell of a lot bigger than we are today and so we have been all along just reassessing what makes sense for us to do how big we want to be both in the context of what our focus should be in terms of our primary focus should be on serving our own customer base and then to the extent that we have efficiencies it makes sense for us to do other business but i guess my point was were not interested being extraordinarily large in the mortgage business just for the sake of being in the mortgage business were in the home lending business because we think home lending is an important product for us to talk to our customers about and thatll ultimately dictate the appropriate size of it and so i would just when you look at how much were originating versus the size of our servicing business the servicing business over time will become smaller and i think thats a smart and good thing for us for many wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 reasons and that as i said were just going to focus on products that make sense for us in the context of where we can make money over the cycles given all of the complexities and all the requirements that banks have that not necessarily everyone else have and make sure were getting the right returns for it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so is this a migration towards originate and retain and the mortgage servicing line goes away as an income statement item because it becomes nonmaterial or is there some middle ground that youre looking to charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co oh yeah i mean listen were still i would still assume that a substantial amount of our mortgage production would be eligible for sale and whether its through the agencies or through the public market thats all options that wed want to continue and so well still be originating mortgages across the spectrum some of which well keep on balance sheet when it makes sense and others of which well sell and we will have in msr again if you just look at how much we originated historically versus what were originating today itll naturally just come down over time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc then two other questions one i think you recently announced a change in your consumer head charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc could you speak through rationale for that and what the wish list is for your new head of consumer charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so mike weinbach who had come into run our home lending businesses put a whole series of things in place including if you look at the leadership across all our card business our home lending business our personal lending business and our auto business all those thats an entirely new management team plus new heads of i can go through all of the other functions as well and mike put that in place and we talked about it and he wanted to do something different and so were lucky enough to have a gentleman named kleber santos who joined us a yearandahalf to two years ago background was he was at capital one prior to that and mckenzie prior to that and kleber and i have worked extremely close together and just thrilled to have him in that role and so i think i wouldnt expect to see significant changes in the things that weve spoken about were focused on continuing the product buildout on the credit card side again focusing on customers that are broader customers in the franchise building our customer service around that and building out our digital capabilities and all of the other parts of the business which is work that we have underway so i dont anticipate any material changes from where we are just but continued trends of the things that weve been talking about wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right and just then just lastly on wealth its an important part of your offering im wondering what youre doing to strategically enhance that offering to your clients be it either through product or how youre structured integration with consumer your it platform and solutions could you just give us a couple of bullet points on whats going on there charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure let me start mike mike and i are both very involved in these conversations with barry and his team i think if you look at our wealth business its run entirely different today than it was several years ago we had separate platforms historically here between our brokerage business we had two different private banks that operated under two different brands we had our bank channel and then completely separately we had a digital platform and we had a platform for advisors that wanted to go independent the digital platforms and the platform for independent advisors had very little investment in it and those were run but all of those businesses they were run as separate businesses with separate product platforms and separate technology and so what weve done is we now have one set of products and service capabilities that all of those product lines have access to and weve combined the entire field under one leader and were investing in our digital capabilities and were investing in the capabilities of those that want to go independent so if they want to do that they can stay here as opposed to elsewhere we are building out capabilities across all the dimensions from the investment capabilities to the banking capabilities our lending capabilities offering trust in the other areas of distribution that didnt have access to those in the past and so its a huge set of changes which also bring with it a set of changes in the backend which were going to moving towards common platforms and its something were really excited about and were just at the beginning of seeing benefits of it and i think its one of the things that will make us appear to for our financial advisors to be an extremely attractive place to be whether they want to be an employee and work for wells fargo or they want to be independent and access our capabilities betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and that change to moving to common platforms whats the timing of that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its not a technology move i think hes talking about platforms in terms of the overall sort of the way we operate the business so it isnt dependent upon a big technology conversion betsy so and then i would just highlight one last thing charlie in his prepared remarks talked about wells fargo premier thats step one in really helping provide a more differentiated and holistic service offering to our affluent clients in the consumer business and the wealth piece is going to be a big part of that and we already have 1500plus advisors in the branch system we already have a great investments platform and so were in the early days but building out a differentiated service offering there as well which will be a big part of the wealth business going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and thats in conjunction with consumer business wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co correct charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah just to expand even further betsy its really a combination of the advisors and the products that barry has to offer in our wealth management business it is also leveraging the lending products that kleber is now responsible for including credit card and including mortgage and potentially auto and some other things there and an integrated offering with marys bank customers who are affluent so its an offering across all of our product sets directed in a much more segmented way than weve ever done in the past and so were extremely excited about it and well be talking more about things that were capabilities that were going to be rolling out throughout the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks operator thank you the next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions charlie just wanted to followup on your question or your comment about loan growth likely to moderate from the first half any color on that what do you think drives that moderation which categories michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey vivek its mike maybe ill take a shot at that look weve just seen i just dont think what weve seen in the second quarter will continue to happen at the same pace we may get surprised and itll be a little better than we think but i think at some point we just feel as you look at any of the uncertainty that might be there or other factors that are causing clients to use their lines today that just may moderate as we go through it i wouldnt look at it as some big warning of anything to come its just were being a little were being a little prudent in terms of the way we think about that growth rate and maybe well be surprised in the upside a little but its just what were seeing right now vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so youre not seeing signs like sort of late in the quarter or anything already starting to show some slowdown or some conversations with clients that are indicating that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co not that i would say are super significant at this point but you can go category by category and say okay well spending in the card space continues to increase at the same pace given some of the uncertainty in the economic environment well see maybe commercial real estate certainly given what were seeing in the real estate market there that appears like itll slow down a little bit as we get in the second half of the year somewhat driven by what were seeing in the capital markets side of the business as well and so with a slowdown in deals happening and rates rising that just is a natural slowdown there and so i just think you go asset class by asset class it just feels as though well see a little bit of moderation as we go through the rest of the year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and a minor one mike for you the hung loan loss number that you gave us was it a gross mark or was it net of fees michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co the leverage finance one vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes yes michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thats after fees vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats after fees okay so then whats the gross mark on that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i dont have the exact number in front of me its not materially different vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thank you operator thank you we have time for one more question today and that will come from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open sir matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 hi i was wondering if you could remind us the targeted customer within credit card as you lean into that business and do you think about maybe slowing from the expansion plans there just given all the recession talk and fears charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah this is charlie matt first off our targeted customers those that we want to have a broader relationship with what we have said is that as weve rolled out this new product set when you look at the credit quality of the borrowers and the spenders that we have been giving our new cards to the credit quality is actually stronger than it had been historically and it still is either on target or stronger than we would have modeled for when we rolled the products out its just were not competing on credit terms were not competing in any way shape or form in terms of that we just want to have a quality offering and we would expect it to be a highquality card customer that we can do other things with across our franchise matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and just any disclosure on fico score in terms of the overall portfolio or the customer that youre growing or leaning into charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think you can get some of that in the queue matt you have to go a little deep into the queue but you can get some of that in the distribution tables in the queue matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay ill look further thanks john m campbell directorinvestor relations wells fargo co all righty everyone thank you very much we
