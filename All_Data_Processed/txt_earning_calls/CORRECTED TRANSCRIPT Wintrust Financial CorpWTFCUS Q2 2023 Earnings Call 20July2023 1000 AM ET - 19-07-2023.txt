over to mr tim crane wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp thank you and good morning everybody we appreciate you joining us for our second quarter earnings call in addition to dave dykstra and rich murphy who the operator introduced dave stoehr our chief financial officer and kate boege our general counsel are with me in the room today in terms of an agenda ill share some high level highlights dave will speak to the financial results and rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance ill wrap up with some summary thoughts and as we always do well do our best to answer some questions on our last call in midapril we were still in a period of volatility and to a degree uncertainty for the banks at the time we talked about several objectives continuing to focus on our customers capitalizing on our strength and stability once again being opportunistic when there is disruption in the market we talked about managing the balance sheet in a conservative fashion growing deposits to fund loan growth and continuing to enhance liquidity and we talked about continuing to take advantage of higher rates specifically to demonstrate our ability despite rising deposit costs to stabilize the net interest margin we feel like our performance on these objectives has been very solid in addition to reporting record income for the first half of the year for the second quarter we had strong and balanced loan and deposit growth adding clients and building the franchise through the volatile period when others were distracted we improved liquidity reducing federal home loan bank borrowings and as you will hear shortly have demonstrated through the sale of a portfolio of loans that occurred after the quarter end the flexibility to continue to manage our balance sheet effectively and while as expected deposit costs are up we are originating very high quality loans with attractive both yields and terms and continue to benefit from loan repricing which we believe differentiates us from many of our peers just to give you some detail youll recall our margin was for the first quarter and specifically at the end of march our margin for the second quarter despite the very good growth was and importantly was stable throughout the quarter lastly our credit performance remains strong with no evidence of systemic issues rich will discuss this in some detail including proactive steps that illustrate our ability to address any softening that may occur again ill come back at the end but with that ill turn this over to dave to provide some additional detail david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp okay thanks tim first with respect to the balance sheet growth were very pleased to see deposits for the quarter grow by billion or on an annualized basis this deposit growth was aided by the popularity of our suite of maxsafe products that provide enhanced fdic coverage and we did not rely upon additional wholesale deposits during the quarter for that growth this growth was also despite our wealth management deposits declining by just under million growing in large part to less deposits from our exchange business due to a slowdown in taxfree commercial real estate exchanges in the marketplace as to deposit composition we again saw some additional movement from noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing accounts the noninterest bearing deposits at the end of the quarter represented of our total deposits compared to at the end of the first quarter these movements do not appear to be unique to us but wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 they obviously increase the cost of deposits for the quarter although i would note that the mix shift out of noninterest bearing deposits seems to have subsided thus far this quarter as the percentage is relatively stable now than it was at the end of the second quarter this strong deposit growth helped fund similarly strong loan growth of billion during the second quarter the growth was predominantly fueled by exceptionally strong production from our commercial premium finance operations and to a lesser extent from commercial real estate growth including draws on previously existing credit lines rich murphy will discuss the loan portfolio growth in more detail in just a bit the investment portfolio declined slightly as we only reinvested about a third of the million of securities that were called away at the end of the prior quarter the additional liquidity provided by not reinvesting the entire amount of those called securities also helped to fund the quarters loan growth the company was able to reduce its nondeposit funding primarily federal home loan bank advances during the quarter by million the result of these balance sheet movements was a growth in total assets of approximately billion a slightly elevated ending loantodeposit ratio of and relatively stable capital ratios all in all it was a very successful quarter and growing our franchise our differentiated business model exceptional service and unique position in the chicago and milwaukee markets continue to serve us well as tim mentioned the exceptionally strong growth in our commercial premium finance portfolio and the outlook for continued loan growth provided us with an opportunity to structure a loan sale transaction of approximately million of our us commercial premium finance portfolio this loan sale occurred earlier this week and provided multiple benefits to us including that it demonstrates that our premium finance portfolio is a strong source of additional liquidity if needed actually it provided us with liquidity this quarter to aid in funding anticipated loan growth reduces our loanto deposit ratio to a desired operating level that is closer to reduces some of the concentration in the premium finance space as weve had strong growth over the last quarter and quite frankly over the last year and would provide a small gain in the third quarter from the sale of those loans as you know these loans are very short term loans that make monthly payments and theyll likely be replaced substantially by new volume by the end of the year next ill cover noteworthy income statement categories starting with the net interest income for the second quarter of net interest income totaled million that was a decrease of million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million compared to the same quarter of the decrease in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the compression in the net interest margin influenced by the higher funding cost the net interest margin was in the second quarter which was just slightly less than the margin that we discussed on our first quarter earnings call and which was the approximate run rate at the end of march however the margin was basis points less than the prior quarter level of importantly the net interest margin was stable for each of the months in the second quarter and as ill discuss later we expect the margin to continue to remain relatively stable for the remainder of as to the details of the component changes impacting the margin in the second quarter relative to the first quarter the company saw a beneficial increase of basis points on the yield on earning assets excluding the impact of our interest rate swap positions a 15basispoint increase in the net free funds contribution and offsetting that was increase of basis points of an increase on the rate paid on liabilities wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and its important to note that roughly half of the margin decline during the quarter was associated with an additional basis points of margin drag from a full quarter impact of the interest rate swap positions that we have in place those swaps were generally put on in the first quarter and the first quarter only had a portion of the impact so this quarter was fully baked and was accounted for about half of the margin decline we continue to believe that our balance sheet structure can provide margin stability as our premium finance portfolios which comprise roughly a third of our loan portfolio should continue to reprice upward over the course of this year and that should substantially mitigate the rise in deposit pricing accordingly based on the current interest rate environment which includes an expected basis point increase by the fed later this month we expect our margin to remain relatively steady in the to range during the remainder of turning to the provision for credit losses the company recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the second quarter this is compared to a provision of million in the prior quarter and million of provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter the higher provision expense in the second quarter relative to the prior quarter was primarily a result of a higher loan growth changes in macroeconomic outlooks including projected credit spreads and projected commercial real estate price index and slightly higher net chargeoffs again rich murphy will talk about credit and the loan portfolio characteristics in just a bit as to other noninterest income and other noninterest expense total noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter and was up approximately million compared to the prior quarter total of million the primary reason for the increase were due to an million increase in mortgage banking revenue the mortgage banking operation saw a slight increase in volume of loans originated during the second quarter with relatively stable production margins roughly of the application volume is still related to purchased home activity application activity continues to be subdued due to lack of housing inventory and higher rates but we would expect right now similar to slightly elevated production but nothing dramatic in the third quarter wealth management revenues improved by million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter and this was bolstered by revenue from the acquisition that we closed at the beginning of the quarter and offset somewhat by continued headwinds relative to the slowdown in the commercial real estate transactions and the resulting impact on the exchange business revenue however these increases were offset by a million reduction on gains and losses related to the companys securities portfolio the company recorded a million gain in the first quarter on securities sales and really nothing in the second quarter of this year million decrease in covered call options also impacted this revenue category as i discussed earlier we did not reinvest much of our securities that were called and this created less opportunity to write covered call transactions during the quarter turning to noninterest expense categories the noninterest expenses totaled million in the second quarter and were up approximately million when compared to the prior year quarter total of million the primary reasons for the increases were related to a few general areas first the acquisition of the wealth management companies at the beginning of the quarter added roughly million of additional expense sprinkled throughout the various expense categories but excluding that impact salaries and employee benefits expense increased by approximately million in the second quarter of compared to the first quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and relative to the prior quarter there was million increase largely related to higher mortgage commissions and to a lesser extent incentive compensation accruals so most of that was commissions related to the increased mortgage operation so this category fluctuates depending upon the mortgage volume the category also saw approximately million of higher employee benefit expenses due to an increased level of health insurance claims during the quarter health insurance claims can fluctuate on a monthly basis as were selfinsured the first quarter was a little low the second quarter was a little higher it can fluctuate but the change between quarters was really more probably a timing of when the employees took advantage of our health insurance program next advertising and marketing expenses increased by million in the second quarter when compared to the prior quarter as we have discussed on previous calls this category of expense tends to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year due to expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships other summertime sponsorship events that we hold in the communities that we serve and marketing of our brand and deposit products also in the second quarter lending expenses increased approximately million due to the strong and higher overall loan origination activity in the second quarter and other than that the expense categories just discussed other than the expense categories just discussed above all the other expense categories were relatively consistent the efficiency ratio increased to for the second quarter from in the first quarter of the year and this was primarily due to the impact of lower net interest margins the reduced level of covered call income and the slightly elevated expenses the net overhead ratio was in the second quarter an increase from in the prior quarter due to the slightly higher expenses in summary we think this was a very solid quarter we had strong loan and deposit growth improved liquidity position stabilized net interest margin with a steady outlook net revenues that were more than of the prior quarters record level despite funding cost pressures continued low levels of nonperforming assets and the second highest quarterly net income result in the companys history we feel like weve managed through a turbulent first half of delivering net income that was a record for the first half of any fiscal year in the companys history and we have a positive outlook for continued growth in assets revenues and earnings so with that i will conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance continued to be very solid in the second quarter from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter was billion the loan growth was largely attributable to over billion of growth in the commercial premium finance category this growth is due to a number of factors the second quarter is historically when we see our highest funding volume and as we have noted in the past several quarters we have seen a significantly harder market for insurance premiums particularly for commercial properties as a result we have seen the average loan size increase wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 finally we continue to see new opportunities as a result of consolidation within the premium finance industry we also saw a good growth in commercial real estate largely resulting from draws on existing construction loans and portfolio residential real estate loans this rate of loan growth is significantly higher than the first quarter and well above our guidance of midtohigh single digits we believe that loan growth for the second half of the year will be more in line with our guidance as we anticipate the premium finance loan growth will moderate and be more in line with historic norms we also anticipate that higher borrowing costs will continue to affect borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects business expansion and equipment purchases however we continue to see solid momentum in our core ci and cre pipelines disruptions in the banking landscape continue to work to our benefit and we have seen numerous quality opportunities from other regional banks in summary we continue to be optimistic of our loan growth for the balance of and we believe that our diversified portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid tohigh single digits and maintain our credit discipline from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans remain stable at basis points or million up slightly from what we saw in the first quarter overall npls continue to be at historically low levels and we are still confident about the solid credit performance of the portfolio chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points which was up from the prior quarter but still at a relatively low level this higher level was primarily attributable to a charge of million which resulted from the sale of a portfolio to coworking office loans totaling million as we have noted in previous calls we are constantly looking for signs of stress in our portfolios and are very focused on our nonowneroccupied office portfolio the common denominator of the loans we sold was the coworking nature of the tenants we believe that this subsegment of the market will continue to experience significant stress from weak tenant demand and rising cost of debt and we took this opportunity to meaningfully reduce our exposure this sale made up close to half of our exposure into this subcategory we have always looked at strategic options to reduce exposures to areas of concern within our portfolio and we will continue to do so finally as detailed on slide we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level as noted in our last earnings call we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real estate loans which compose roughly one quarter of our total loan portfolio higher borrowing costs and pressure on occupancy and lease rates are cause for concern particularly in the office category on page weve updated a number of important characteristics of our office portfolio currently this portfolio remains steady at billion or of our total cre portfolio and only of our total loan portfolio of the billion of office exposure over is medical office or owneroccupied the average size of a loan in the office portfolio is only million we only have five loans above million there has been significant concern about office properties located within central business districts our cbd exposure is limited to million or approximately one quarter of the office portfolio half of this is in chicago and half is in other cities the bulk of the portfolio is located in suburban areas and areas outside cbds wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and portfolio performance todate has been very good with no loans currently over days past due we continue to perform portfolio reviews regularly on this portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers we are not immune from the macro effects that challenge this product type but we believe that our portfolio is well constructed very granular and should perform well moving forward as noted earlier higher borrowing costs and pressure on lease renewals are cause for concern across the cre space to better understand how these issues could impact our portfolio our cre team updated their deep dive analysis on every loan over million which will be renewing between now through the first quarter of this analysis which covered of all cre loans maturing during this period resulted in the following more than of the loans will clearly qualify for renewal at the prevailing rates roughly of these loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a shortterm extension at prevailing rates and approximately of the loans will require some additional attention which could include a paydown or pledge of additional collateral we have tentative agreement on renewal terms with many of the borrowers in this final group again our overall cre portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates but we have been diligently identifying weaknesses in the portfolio and working with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes and we believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape and situated to weather the challenges ahead that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to tim timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp thanks rich to wrap up for the last several months weve had the opportunity and in some cases i would say the responsibility to explain to our customers why wintrust continues to be a better alternative than the larger toobig tofail banks not only have we successfully done that with almost no attrition but we continue to win business and as you can see grow deposits and build our franchise we continue to think were uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current environment with our diverse businesses that limit the potential impact of economic softness in any individual area and we remain positioned to benefit from higher rates as dave noted and we noted in the press release we expect that our margin will be relatively stable for the remainder of the year and our net interest income will increase in the coming quarters i would say that the current market is a little bit choppy and we remain incredibly focused to pursue opportunities that we see and well do that aggressively in the coming months at this point ill pause and we can take some questions elizabeth back to you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey im going to start off first question i guess you used the word choppy tim and you guys talked about a little bit slower loan growth in the second half of the year but you put up a pretty good quarter and i guess my question is what are the pipelines look like whats the quality of what youre seeing and very early tim you alluded to like pricing and structure being better but touch a little bit on that in terms of how that may have changed timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah ill take the first part and rich can add to that with respect to choppy companies are obviously reacting to higher rates and certainly real estate projects in some cases are on hold and theres folks still wrestling with labor issues which we think are generally better but not universally better and then obviously there are some competitors that are pulling back in terms of credit and their participation in the market and so were seeing opportunities i think a lot of people are seeing opportunities and we just have to be selective and disciplined and i think our team is doing a nice job in that regard which is driving both higher yields and better terms in some cases more equity and real estate deals so rich please add to that richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah no i think you said it well every week that goes by we see new opportunities really across the portfolio in terms of customers who arent getting their existing banks to work with them in a productive way and were also seeing tremendous amount of opportunities on large capital markettype opportunities where there is multiple banks involved and theres almost more than you could possibly want frankly because there is just so much thats out there right now so it does give us the opportunity to pick and choose price accordingly structure accordingly weve always had a history of being disciplined in the space and thats not going to change but its a great opportunity for us wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 disruption always has worked to our benefit postpandemic postppp we saw a very similar kind of environment where a lot of banks were kind of struggling getting their footing were seeing that right now as well and so were pretty optimistic but most importantly we just want to stay disciplined jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough the premium finance size limits on your balance sheet we expect to see more of these sales and im just curious if you guys continue to service that i know theyre short very short term in nature but help us understand the outlook for that in terms of on your balance sheet a yeah so the we sold is an offbalance sheet transactions that will come off of the books in the third quarter and jon as you know and probably most people on this call know is that those loans probably make monthly payments on average have an average life of months to months so by the end of the year theyll substantially have been paid off anyway so if you recall we did a securitization of premium finance loans a decade ago or so and it gives about a million or million facility that we did for a few years and so its not a new transaction for us but we thought it was important to get the plumbing in place we had billion quarter a great growth quarter the market is still hard the disruptions helped us the outlook is good there and so we thought getting the plumbing in place and sort of testing it out having another source of liquidity was a good thing to do we have the opportunity to do it in the future but right now we dont have any plans to do another loan sale but if we were to have outside the loan growth going forward we might be able to pull the trigger and do it quickly and now that weve demonstrated that we can do it again a and jon yes we continue to service those loans i think it was part of your question a yeah yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay just last one mortgage obviously was a decent quarter for you but dave you said slightly elevated production in the third quarter is that what you mean and just give us an idea of what youre seeing there david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and were wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc indiscernible milliontype quarter david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean were just a few weeks into the third quarter but application volumes have ticked up just slightly so i would expect that to be up a little bit but as part of it depends on what happens to the valuations of your msrs too but from a production perspective i would expect it to be up just a little bit and well just have to see how the production flows through but nothing substantial there but if its up a couple of million dollars that might be at the right neighborhood but well have to just see how it plays through jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right fair enough thanks a lot guys appreciate it a yeah thanks jon operator our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning i was kind of blanked out there i didnt hear if that was my name or not but good morning everyone thanks for taking my question a couple of things on the funding side you seem to still have good growth obviously youve got a vehicle now where you can reduce or securitize or sell some of those loans but on the funding side going forward how are you thinking about incremental fhlb advances versus deposits whether its cds or brokered cds which is the most attractive source on the funding side right now and how do the costs compare right now timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp sure david i mean generally wed like to grow deposits to match any loan growth and we think deposits are the core of our franchise obviously the maxsafe product suite was very helpful to us in the quarter clients didnt have to go elsewhere even at competitors where there are reciprocal products we dont have to pay the additional fee that might be involved with that so that worked out very very well wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 the maxsafe product in general is in total a little less than in terms of the deposit cost and were putting loans on it to at this point so the spread is good we continue to add business everybody is asking for deposits its a focus so were going to try to grow deposits before we use other liquidity sources david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks tim and then for the competitive dynamics for deposits right now are you seeing more pressure from the larger regional banks are you seeing more pressure from the community banks where is the competition more intense on the deposit side timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well all over would be my blanket answer but certainly the regional banks and rich mentioned that some companies are finding it more difficult to get what i would call transactionaltype work done and for folks that just dont have a relationship with their bank the relationship can be either uncertain or strained at this point and were very focused on having relationships and taking good care of our clients and so one that hasnt been difficult for us for our existing base and two its created an opportunity in certain places to see new clients that frankly were very happy to be doing business with david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks tim appreciate it timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah you bet operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good morning everyone hi good morning maybe a question on expenses some other banks are facing some nii pressure and prospects of rising credit costs could you just talk about maybe expense management plans and your thoughts on expenses over the next two to four quarters david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp sure i mean were always looking out for expenses our approach has generally been to grow the balance sheet and try to grow the revenues at a quicker pace than the expenses and like weve talked were pretty optimistic about balance sheet growth and pretty optimistic about maintaining the margin which would translate into increased nii so from that perspective were very optimistic wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 on the expense side this quarter had as i said a few increases the seasonal marketing the addition of the expenses from the acquisitions and slightly elevated lending expenses due to the doubledigit loan growth and increased mortgage production so those were the primary reasons for the increase this quarter but were always looking at expenses were very focused on them right now to keep them in check and try to keep them less than the revenue growth going forward but we dont want to cut to the bone here and not take advantage of the growth opportunities in the marketplace weve always done that weve always taken advantage of the disruption and we think were in great position to do that again terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks dave and then as a followup it sounds like next week were going to get updated regulation for banks over billion of assets whats the risk that that kind of dribbles down into banks maybe billion and above and how are you thinking about any changes in regulation for a bank thats what billion or billion of assets today david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i guess well watch with great interest what they come out with but i think youre right i think most of its focused at billion were really not there yet i think most of the focus will be on interest rate risk and liquidity management at the supervisory level right now and making sure that the risk management in place there we think we do a great job with that so were not that concerned about it but well watch with interest what they come up with but we dont have any plans of hitting billion in the next year or so here so i think we have some time to plan for it terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc definitely thanks for taking my questions david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thanks terry operator our next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hi good morning guys timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp morning wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc im curious if we could talk through deposit pricing just a little bit i know weve touched on it a couple of different ways but first i wanted to confirm that the guidance of to on margin incorporates any sort of mix shift that might happen richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yes benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay just confirming that one so when you think about the incremental dollar at this point without giving away too much of your playbook how are you guys approaching the next dollar are you looking for relationships that automatically have to bring over deposits from day one on the new loans are you looking for any different niche avenues of deposit pricing or deposit gathering at a lower price and then kind of juxtaposing that so how has the flows or mix shift changed over the last call it days a well were always looking to gather deposits at lower costs and with the commercial relationships we win come the treasury businesses and the operating accounts that are generally at the most favorable price the maxsafe product for us is mostly interestbearing theres several flavors of it some that are from municipalities for example and some that are for our corporate customers at the margin thats call it and then weve been offering some promotional type cd activity that we really use to kind of balance the remainder of the activity so weve got a lot of levers to pull were certainly asking for deposits with our customers but frankly thats not anything new for us i mean we want the relationships and we want the operating accounts from these companies so we think we can gather deposits at an appropriate level that allow us to operate as we have and we talked about the loan yields and structures being attractive to us and so we dont think at the moment were giving up a lot in terms of spread david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and we also this is dave right we also think we we have a great position in the chicago market weve got the fourth largest deposit market share behind three big guys chase bank of america and bmo and then it really falls off at least for banks headquartered in chicago in illinois we actually have the largest market share and were less than in chicago and in illinois quite frankly and the big banks really as we talked earlier arent the ones putting the pressure on some of the regional banks that have presence here are offering higher rates and the community banks are pretty disciplined so if someone wants to do business with a larger bank thats located in illinois were sort of the goto bank and we give great service so we think were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this and offer good products give good service and cement in the customer relationship so were kind of excited about the opportunities there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you thats helpful and then if we could switch gears a little bit towards credit i know the guidance here was a little bit softer loan growth in the back half of the year to get more in line with previous guidance when you think about the provision i know that cecl is a large component and frankly the first half of this year feels like the first half of the decade so its a bit unknown economically speaking but how do you guys think about the provision going forward if loan growth slows a little do you think that provision could come down from here or how do you guys approach it a well cecl is a life of loan concept as far as forecasting out what the losses are in your existing portfolio so yeah if theres a loan growth thats higher or lower thats going to impact it obviously theres a mix issue if we grow a lot in the life or commercial premium finance portfolios those are less provision than a cre loan or a commercial loan but generally speaking if you have higher growth then well have a higher provision but the things that impact the provision substantially are some of the economic factors so if the forecast from the economists that are out there get less recessionfocused and more soft landing or mild recessionfocused then i think some of those economic forecast factors will get better and that would have a positive impact on the provision but im not an economist i dont make economic predictions but we follow moodys we follow some other economic forecasts as weve modeled out our cecl so i would suspect unless theres a big change in the economic forecast that growth would be the item that would impact the provision benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got it okay thats helpful i appreciate the color guys a yeah thanks ben operator our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning dave just a question on the kind of a nuance on the capital the covered call strategy how do we think about i guess broadly you reinvest in going forward that line item and obviously it will play into the size of the overall earning asset base david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well our securities i mean generally we like to run in the roughly loantodeposit ratio and then the remaining liquidity is either overnight money or securities and our securities have generally been of the asset base and so we would expect to sort of keep it in that range and use our liquidity to fund what we expect to be good loan growth so the reinvestment of the cash flows up the securities we would put back into wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 some sort of asset class and weve generally done ginnie maes and if you do ginnies or fannies you can write covered calls against them so where you generally get higher covered calls is when rates go down and the securities get called away and then you reinvest those securities and then you write calls against them again or in a flat rate environment where you can continue to write calls on them quarterafterquarter but i would suspect that given the demand we have for loan and given that we are sort of at a decent spot we could the investment portfolio go up another million or billion or something over time as we grow here probably but thats not going to create a tremendous amount of covered calls so i would probably say in this environment if youre thinking million to million of covered calls maybe a normal range given the interest rate environment and our investments right now thats probably not a bad way to look at it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then just two small ones maybe a comment on gain on sale margins for mortgage and then i want to make sure i heard you the million loss on that is that a million sale for roughly a little under loss rate on the office loans is that what i heard a thats correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay a and then the gain on sale dave david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp the gain on sales for us its been holding around the last couple of quarters so pretty pretty stable christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks dave operator our next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 a good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc good morning everyone how are you a great brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask on the fixed rate loan portfolio its about billion i just wanted to make sure that the billion to billion that you mentioned that reprices or matures over the next year or so do you happen to know what the existing yield is on that portfolio and then like what the origination rates look like right now a well if you look at that billion billion of it is fixed rate commercial premium finance loans so the vast majority of that is the commercial premium finance portfolio which oneninth of that basically turns over every month so those loans generally are pricing that just netnet sort of prime plus one range plus or minus depending on the mix of large loans versus small loans so that portfolio will be turning over and you can go back and look we put it in our press release we sort of show what the indices are you can go back and look at what prime was nine months ago and what it is now and that should be roughly the pickup youd get in the yield on those brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much and then i did want to ask just within the availableforsale portfolio you gave the effective duration of i wanted to ask you if you knew what the conditional prepayment rate youre assuming within that duration calculation is a i dont have it handy right now the majority of those are ginnie maes but i dont know what i dont have it handy with me right now we can get back to you on that brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and i just want to ask just on the cre deep dive that you talked about where i think it was would need some service type of shortterm extensions a little additional attention or qualifying for a renewal wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 i guess is that the way it works down you kind of look at it and you say you qualify you might need a shortterm extension you probably need some more equity i guess like what drives the delineation between just needing a shortterm extension and maybe needing to bring more equity in the table and then if you could just on the one that need a shortterm extension like what happens after they get the shortterm extension like how long is the extension for and do those loans move off the balance sheet and go somewhere else just trying to understand the moving parts there a yeah the ones for shortterm extension is generally were transitioning out to end financing thats probably going to be off our balance sheet and thats pretty typical the history of payoffs is pretty substantial in terms of what we see every quarter just rolling off so theres lot of construction financing that we do that were not going to be the best scenario for them in the long term so thats kind of how that works and we still see lots of liquidity out in that end market as it relates to the other part of the question which is what are we looking for typically what triggers that conversation is really going to be performance of the underlying property which is really our primary focus you have lease income that youre matching up against your expenses and your debt service and if there is a mismatch there were going to have a conversation and generally speaking i think most of our borrowers will still tell you that they believe strongly in their project and property and they want to support it i mean generally those conversations at this point are still very productive and then we do have situations where in this loan sale where we had conversations and you could see that it probably was not going to get better and at that point in time we have to make a decision as to do we because of theres so much liquidity still in the market this was an opportune time to just say the situation is probably not going to get any better and we need to probably think about some alternatives brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thats helpful thank you for that and you did mention that youre still seeing a lot of liquidity in that end market is that for a wide range of projects or is it i guess more tailored to specific asset classes ph within construction where theres available liquidity a yeah thats a good point if its multifamily thats industrial theres a lot of appetite still out there for that type of product obviously in some of these more distressed areas like cre and retail thats a different story altogether but we dont do a lot of the construction financing in those segments so generally speaking were looking to just transition loans out for end financing weve been really focused heavily on more multifamily and industrial over the past three or four years brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 got it and i know it was a smaller amount of loans and it was indiscernible it was a relatively small charge but if i did i hear you right and read right i guess that the million charge that you took against million of coworking office loans was that an million charge on a million loan portfolio a thats correct it was a small group of properties no one market in particular but they were all thinking as i said the common denominator is that coworking space which we think is probably going to be the last piece to recover in office and probably the hardest to kind of retenant at this point so as we had said in the past we try to be really strategic in terms of taking advantage of the liquidity and albeit theres probably less liquidity for this type of product out there and thats why the discount but its better off just get the runway clear because were not sure whats coming down the road but we want to be prepared brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no i understand that and so you dont think that that level of charge is indicative of what you might see if you or other banks maybe had to sell what i would call a more regular way kind of normal office property richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no no not at all i mean again in the coworking space which we have very little of and this was almost half of that total that we have its a much more distressed subsegment of this office category so we think that youre probably going to see a little more stress in that subcategory but in general were still pretty confident about where valuations are brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then just one last one for me just on the loan sale within the commercial finance premium finance portfolio who are the end buyers of these you dont need to give a name obviously but just like a type is it private equity like who are the end buyers of this loan in this type of loan portfolio and i think you mentioned that this kind of gives you the opportunity to explore other types of these transactions down the road what would drive you to kind of look to lean into selling more of these loans versus keeping them on balance sheet richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah so we sold in a special purpose vehicle that then sells it out the asset conduits that are investing so yeah were not going to give the name right now as we have an nda but its your standard financial institution conduit financing so again we didnt have to do it if we didnt sell it off to some of these firms that are buying distressed assets obviously this is not a distressed portfolio we have no reason to do that this was more testing the plumbing and getting a setup to provide a lever to pull for liquidity if we need it so i think the reason you would do it again is if loan growth was very very strong and you needed to fund it and the deposit growth wasnt as quick again as tim says we much prefer to grow our franchise weve always done that to grow the franchise through deposits which is the core business that we love but to the extent that the asset growth would outstrip the deposit growth in any given quarter we could pull the lever on this either as a wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 distinct sale like we did this time or you could also set up a similar transaction where its a revolving securitization facility where you could just continue to feed it into were not as favorable of studying that because generally youd want to set it up for a two or threeyear time period at least and your crystal ball isnt always so clear as how strong loan demand will be three years out so wed rather do it discreetly and kind of bespoke sort of transactions as needed but right now we dont anticipate doing it again in the future but if we did it again its probably a good thing because that means were having really really good loan growth brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i think i heard you right that youre going to continue to service these loans for those borrowers but they are pretty short term so is there much in the way of servicing income that will come from that richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no no theyre very short term and the servicing costs are pretty low in this portfolio brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp you bet operator our next question comes from the line of nathan race with piper sandler nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co first one on just the increase in the substandard loans and the growth it looks like theyre up versus the first quarter any specific drivers there of note and to what extent if any did that impact the provision in the quarter richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 no i dont think theres necessarily any color that i could give you on that i mean the levels are still very subdued in terms of overall but in terms of driving changes in the cecl i dont know if it really had a whole lot of yeah so im just kind of taking a look at it yeah and were at still so i mean as it relates to overall levels i think were still in pretty good shape kind of looking at my list of additions to it and there are a lot of common denominators here we try to be incredibly proactive in our portfolio reviews of identifying any type of loan that might be in the series up to the segment for instance where you have decline in debt service coverage that gets a little bit closer to to or at to thats going to be something so we see obviously some of that theres also as a commercial customer is compressed a little bit in cash flow we might make that as substandard and typically were going to anticipate that thats going to turn around so theres no one thing i can point to but just certainly higher borrowing costs probably would be the primary driver of that as it puts a little more strain on cash flow both in the ci and cre segment but as it relates to cecl i mean not a whole i think as dave pointed out earlier i think the bigger drivers on cecl is really going to be in some of these economic factors david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think its more a function of just our very proactive approach to reviewing these credits and making sure we understand where everything is again they remain at a very low level nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful and just going back to terrys question around expenses i think last quarter dave you were talking about kind of a highsingle digit outlook for this year does that still kind of hold david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think it does i mean you got a if you factor out the impact of the acquisitions weve always had thats excluding acquisitions but yeah i think that still holds so this quarter ive talked about the reasons for this quarter but yeah i think we still look at that as being appropriate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co perfect and just one last housekeeping question with the sale of some msrs in the quarter did that impact mortgage revenue in any way materially in richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no we took an opportunity we always mark the msrs to market and we had the market value of them at the end of last quarter when we started to look at this transaction when we actually sold them this quarter were roughly the same so there wasnt a big impact that was really just reducing risk again msrs had run up nicely and did take a little bit of that asset off of our books at sort of the top of the msr valuation as we look at it seemed to be prudent and the loan the servicing rights that we sold were generally wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 those loans that were outside of the chicago and milwaukee market area so they werent our banking customers they were loans that wed made in other regions of the united states nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it that does make sense if i could just ask one more on capital total riskbased was down to i know you guys tend to want to stay above but i imagine with the im sorry the insurance premium finance securitization thats upcoming and just given perhaps higher for longer interest rate environment that you guys have plenty of capital to just kind of continue support the growth opportunities that exist organically in front of you today is that the right way to a yeah yeah we think so nate i mean obviously this was a big growth quarter and the sale occurred after the quarter end so we feel comfortable and if loan growth normalizes into the range rich discussed we should be adding capital a yeah and the other thing that happened the other capital ratio stayed relatively flat total riskbased was down a little bit because as you know we had a subdebt offering out there that subdebt you lose of it each year as it matured and the last of that subdebt capital ran off on june so that impacted the total riskbased capital just a little bit but clearly we expect the capital ratios to grow going forward based upon our projected earnings and balance sheet growth nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and it sounds like the priorities for excess capital deployment are still organic growth first perhaps buybacks or lower down on the spectrum just given the organic growth opportunities today a yeah i think thats fair nate i mean obviously we look at all the alternatives but again we anticipate good growth we like where we are in the market nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color and taking the questions a you bet thank you have a good day operator our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co just wanted to check back in on the hedging strategy on margin appreciate the guidance the to for the back half of the year i guess whats the duration of those hedges i think in early parts of the year you talked about maybe taking the top end off of 4plus but also protecting much below i guess does that extend into basically what youve hedged in and i guess how does that range get affected further out kind of with another hike no hikes or kind of a cut im just trying to think of that duration of those hedges does that get into or any early expectations to how margin behaves into a yeah no yeah when we did those hedges they were generally longerterm transaction so on slide of our earnings deck or you can look in the last 10q that we had the maturity dates range from september of all the way out into so they are longerterm hedges and if you look at that slide its got the swap rates and im which are generally from the mid into the low range as far as where the swap rates are at so we in the market given the slope of the curve it just hasnt been that favorable from our perspective to enter into more so we havent we didnt enter into any in the second quarter well still look at that but theyre there for downside protection and quite frankly as i said in my comments had it not been for this portfolio our margin if we didnt put the swaps in our margin would be basis points higher overall because thats the impact this quarter last quarter the impact was basis points so the differential this quarter was basis points first quarter the impact was basis points this quarter was basis points so the differential was basis points but we think thats a fair price to pay if we can keep the margin relatively stable like we think it is to protect from the downside risk of a substantial rate reduction so just the risk mitigation again jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah but not a no longer term jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 all right so not to sort of extend that guidance range into but you feel pretty good about kind of maintaining that level even beyond into next year a well it depends i mean everybodys view is different if you take the higher for longer then i think that bodes well for us if you look at the curve and rates drop precipitously then we probably would have some pressure on our margin but thats why we have these hedges in place to help mitigate some of that impact jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thats helpful just to see where you lean into that just the last one would be just checking in on wealth management i think the acquisition sort of juiced that number a bit but looking forward to the outlook would you expect that growth to level off linked quarter was strong but maybe acquisitiondriven a that was acquisitiondriven so we would expect to continue to grow it but it would just be slow steady growth and some of that is obviously dependent on the market because you earn your fees based on the underlying asset value so if the market continues to rally then that would be beneficial for us jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thank you timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp elizabeth we can do one more if you want operator we have a question from the line of brody preston with ubs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys sorry about that i just wanted to clarify something on the coworking space is that like a wework i just wanted to make sure i totally understood what the property was a yeah kind of wework light its just
