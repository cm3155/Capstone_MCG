financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 thank you kay and good morning thanks everybody for joining us today is certainly shaping up to be an interesting year weve all had a frontrow seat to the recent volatility across the industry sparked by the failure of svb and exacerbated by a few market participants and the media while the events of the past several weeks that put banks in the spotlight may not have been anticipated trends in the latter part of and early have pointed to coming challenges we expected the continuing inflation changes in the yield curve the outflows of excess liquidity built up during the pandemic and the resulting deposit beta acceleration in response to the fomc raising an unprecedented times in the last months would likely present some inherent but manageable risks to the industry by design this would also lead to eventual curtailment of credit and the slowing of the economy at umb were always prepared for different environments with our variable asset base diverse deeply entrenched deposit base ample sources of liquidity growing fee income businesses and a long track record of conservative underwriting resulting in excellent asset quality and weve taken the additional steps to enhance that risk profile over the past few weeks even with the more challenging environment in march we had a strong first quarter like others we saw rising deposit costs which were already beginning to materialize before the recent market turmoil the flexibility weve built on the asset side of our balance sheet including a low loantodeposit ratio of total loans repricing within months and nearly billion of securities cash flow expected over the same time will help mitigate this impact on liability pricing our first quarter results included average deposit growth of and average loan growth of on a linked quarter annualized basis we had continued momentum in our fee businesses and credit quality remains excellent with net chargeoffs of just of average loans nonperforming loans further improved from year end and were at just of total loans as of march as youll see in our 10q criticized loans were flat our watch list levels which are still passed loans will bounce around as we manage our book were quick to recognize trouble take action and address any issues this proactive management has been consistent and historically weve seen very little migration to loss turning to the balance sheet the drivers behind our linkedquarter annualized growth and average loan balances this quarter are on slide total top line loan production as shown on slide with million for the quarter payoffs and paydowns represent of loans in the first quarter the average for the past five quarters was just under in line with our longerterm trend commercial real estate and construction growth in the first quarter came predominantly from industrial and multifamily categories this quarter we provided additional disclosures on our cre portfolio in our line of business section on slide and credit quality is strong across our book and the portfolio is welldiversified by property classification tenant type and geography as it relates to office cre our portfolio of just under billion represents just of total umb loans the average size of an office credit is million and approximately of the portfolio matures in or later the office portfolio is recourse and has a weighted average loantovalue of approximately the smaller nonrecourse portion has a lower ltv ratio of and is either leased to credit tenants long term or with our strongest sponsors weve generally limited our office lending to our strongest and most experienced sponsors and we adhere to conservative standards which include underwriting to imputed or stressed interest rates and moderate loantovalue ratios umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 the majority of our office portfolio is located within umbs midwestern footprint and we have no office exposure in major coastal markets given our midwestern focus our borrowers are seeing continued leasing interest and increasing returntooffice activity this is supported by the makeup of our portfolio which is in suburban office parks and an additional in medical offices we continue to monitor the portfolio closely and stay ahead of any emerging risks looking ahead to the second quarter we see opportunities in our various verticals across the footprint we will continue to remain disciplined on our pricing and further emphasizing lendings that come with deposit relationships on the other side of the balance sheet average deposits increased on an annualized basis compared to the fourth quarter as we shared earlier in our 8k since march balances increased more than billion through quarter end for comparison purposes the peers who have reported through the end of last week reported a median increase in average deposits just over looking at dda we saw a shift of less than half of what our peers reported importantly as we point out each quarter activity in our commercial and institutional customer base differentiates us from our peers with larger retail customer bases on any given day and particularly at month end and quarter end deposit balances fluctuate for normal business purposes such as payroll dividends and other expected activity this is why we focus on average balances over the quarter slides and show the composition and the characteristics of our deposit portfolio we have a very diverse deposit base across various industries lines of business and geographies of our deposit accounts span years or more additionally we have deep business relationships with depositors with many using other products and services such as asset servicing corporate trust payments and treasury management uninsured deposits adjusted to exclude affiliate and collateralized deposits were of total deposits as of march we have the opportunity to reduce this ratio even further as much as points by using sweeps additionally we continue to enhance our already strong contingent liquidity sources while increasing our proportion of insured deposits as a result our liquidity covered approximately of uninsured deposits as of april lastly before i turn it over to ram id like to mention that ive appreciated the efforts of the research analyst community including those of you on this call youve made an effort to educate market participants and avoid contributing to unfounded fears ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner ill share a few additional drivers of our first quarter results then ill discuss some of the key balance sheet items that are top of mind in the current environment related to deposits securities liquidity and capital net income for the first quarter was million or per share operating pretax preprovision eps for the quarter was per share compared to for the first quarter of net interest income decreased versus the fourth quarter as the positive benefit from asset repricing and the benefit from loan growth was offset by the mix shift in liabilities and the impact of fewer days in the quarter net interest margin for the first quarter was a decrease of basis points from the linked quarter drivers included negative impacts of approximately basis points from deposit pricing and mix and basis points umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 related to changes in fed funds purchased repurchase agreements and shortterm borrowing levels offsets include a positive basis points from loan mix and repricing and basis points from the benefit of refunds and changes in liquidity balances while deposit costs continued to increase our earning asset beta of is outpacing our total cost of deposit and total cost of fund betas of and respectively cycle todate we continue to benefit from the shorter tenor of our asset base including the fact that of our loan portfolio reprices within months on a linked quarter basis our loan yield beta of outperformed our total deposit beta of and total cost of funds beta of but were lower than our cost of interestbearing deposit beta of as i noted earlier the beta on our cost of interestbearing deposits increased due to mix shift including our issuances of brokerage cds with different tenors prior to and subsequent to the failure of svb in the first quarter approximately of our average deposits were interestfree ddas down slightly from in the fourth quarter the flexibility embedded in our balance sheet from variable rate loans that reprice and a higher proportion of ddas provides us the ability to absorb and mitigate increases in cost of liabilities in the current high interest rate environment as we noted before given the larger corporate and institutional nature of our deposit base our deposit betas are more pronounced than many of our peers in the current interest rate environment weve taken additional steps enhancing asset pricing discipline and further emphasizing lending that has deposit relationships as well as we look ahead there are many factors that play into our expectation for net interest margin including the shape of the yield curve anticipated changes to shortterm interest rates continuation of mix shift higher cash levels and competitive pressures from other financial institution and offbalancesheet products there is a greater degree of uncertainty today given the confluence of all these factors looking ahead we would expect midsingledigit growth in net interest income on a yearoveryear basis additionally we expect to generate positive operating leverage in our reported noninterest income of million contains the marketrelated variances including in company owned life insurance income of million versus just in the fourth quarter and a million increase in customerrelated derivative income coli income has a similar offset in deferred compensation expense customer acquisition and solid performance in corporate trust funds services and private wealth drove a increase in trust and securities processing income quarterly income in that category exceeded million and we continue to see opportunities for growth the million decrease in net investment security gains relates to an impairment in the value of one of our bank sub debt holdings the detailed drivers of our million in noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release a few items of note employee benefits expense increased million largely due to typical seasonal reset of payroll taxes insurance and 401k expense as previously noted the industrywide increase and fdic assessment fees added million and we had a full quarter of increased amortization expense related to the hsa acquisition in the fourth quarter as we discussed last quarter we expect approximately million of additional amortization expense annually these increases were offset by normalization of accruals related to various incentive plans and timing of marketing and other spend from elevated fourth quarter levels considering those variances we would put our quarterly starting point closer to million for noninterest expenses despite positive trends in the credit metrics provision for the first quarter increased to million and included approximately million related to forecasted changes to key economic variables and million for growth in our loan portfolio the quality of our loan portfolio remains excellent as mariner mentioned umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 our coverage ratio increased to basis points of total loans from basis points at year end our effective tax rate was for the first quarter compared to in the first quarter of the increase rate was driven primarily by excess tax benefits related to equitybased compensation for full year we anticipate the tax rate will be approximately to now looking in more detail at the balance sheet ill start with the details on our investment portfolio slides and our average investment security balances remained relatively flat from the fourth quarter at billion excluding the billion of industrial revenue bonds in the heldtomaturity category during the quarter million of securities with an average yield of rolled off the yield on our afs portfolio increased basis points to and the htm portfolio excluding of the irbs i mentioned had an average yield of for the first quarter an increase of seven basis points the portfolio is split roughly between available for sale and held to maturity and the afs book has a duration of four years additionally the portfolio is expected to generate nearly billion of cash flows in the next months providing further funding flexibility the roll off of these securities will also improve our aoci position over that period our unrealized loss position has improved from year end benefiting from the reduced marks of afs portfolio and htm portfolios as interest rates have come down since december as of march the unrealized pretax loss on the afs portfolio narrowed to million or of the amortized cost for the htm portfolio this loss was million relative to the amortized cost as weve shared previously we transferred securities with an amortized cost of billion from afs to htm in the remaining balance of the unrealized pretax losses related to the transfer was million as of march additionally an aftertax gain of million related to fair value hedges was included in aoci we have no need to sell bonds which could result in realized losses we intend to hold these securities as they are important asset class used to collateralize municipal and trust deposits and can be used to bolster our liquidity slide highlights our liquidity position along with the contingent sources of funding available to meet customer and operational need as of march we had billion in available liquidity sources as mariner mentioned liquidity coverage of uninsured deposits had increased to as of last week also on that slide weve included our regulatory capital ratios our cet1 of compares favorably to the peer median our tangible common equity ratio in percent excluding aoci tce was that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we have our first question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good morning thanks for the mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc first just good job during a difficult environment with the deposit balances thats nice to see the resilience of the model there as we look at deposits i think in the past youve talked about dda as a percentage of total maybe troughing around is that still a good sort of floor to expect on zero cost deposits mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well this is mariner i mean we watch it closely we still expect to maintain the overall outsized balances who knows exactly what the pressure on short term will be on higher interest rates its possible that a little bit could move yet from where we are at today but we dont necessarily expect that we just cant really tell you one way or the other if theres a little more movement because of the higher rate environment dont expect it to leave the balance sheet however ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey this is ram jared the only thing i would add is last cycle we bottomed out at and since then we have a lot of new businesses like corporate trust on the aviation side that contribute a lot of ddas as well so arguably you would assume that it would be higher than where we bottomed out last time but as mariner said this is unprecedented rate environment and rates are much higher than anybody ever foresaw that mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp but i mean its been more stable than weve its been more stable than we would have expected it to be really given the higher rate environment so we dont expect a whole lot of movement jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as we look at the beta sort of the cumulative beta through the cycle what should we expect for a peak through the cycle beta on overall cost of deposits or interest however you want to look at it umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i mean were as i said in my prepared comments were probably assuming another rate hike and we stay at i would expect our total cost of beta to be around jared mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and jared i would just add we like to focus everybody on the whole balance sheet anyway we expect our asset pricing to remain strong and disciplined and obviously our asset base is very flexible and with of our loans repricing with interest rates and within months is really really important from our perspective and not just focus on deposits jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe once we see rate cuts at some point in the future how quickly can that pass through to margin what type of lag should we expect once we actually see cuts in the future ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp this is such a different environment i guess its hard to tell i mean if you look at past cycles the deposits will move faster on the way down which is the opposite on the way up right so on the way down historically weve benefited faster because the deposits move first on the way down so if thats any if the past is any indication of the future were positioned pretty well for that its probably too early to talk about how prepared we are with the assets on what term and what floors are and all that i mean its awfully early in the cycle to get movement on that but well be prepared for you when it comes jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right and then just finally for me i appreciate the color on the office space and the detail around how high quality it is as youre talking to sponsors better maybe coming due in the next months is your sense that do those come to you theyd be that theres access to additional equity to put into those deals has they come to you to keep those strong metrics or do you think that theyre more willing to sell on properties at renewal now mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no ill take a stab at that and tom can add to it i mean these are very very strong borrowers with low loan to values stressed interest rates on the front end and we do all our work on the front end thats probably the best answer id give you we stress these upfront and to very very strong liquid sponsors with big portfolios of other real estate and strong cash flow coming off of other projects i dont know tom if youd add anything were the wrong bank we focus on the office portfolio its less than its super strong we dont think about it over here but tom i dont know thomas s terry a executive vice president chief lending officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 yeah this is tom terry just to reiterate of our total portfolio and we are more suburban in terms of more low and mediumrise office as opposed to downtown office and so we have very strong sponsors but we dont have any worries about their ability to put in more equity if thats required at the time of renewal mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and i think in our remarks we talked about how much of it reprices in and beyond when think about the cycle and the changes in interest rates i mean were probably pretty well protected anyway by the time rolls around jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great appreciate the additional color thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw chris your line is now open mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great hey good morning everyone just going back to credit obviously this earnings season have been a lot about office real estate mariner or team is this where we need to focus for your company the most is there other portfolios that perhaps are getting more attention mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp just a moment ago as i tried to reference we dont worry about our office at all here again its a very very small part of our portfolio we dont worry about office here and i dont if you go to our provision expense million as weve mentioned in our comments million of that is tied to the cecl process that we now use with economic factors million of it was based on loan growth we have zero expectation that we fall outside of our historic chargeoffs metrics regardless of what the environment is weve been at this a long time in this room with me ive got jim rine and tom terry three of us have been doing this together through the last three cycles and weve had outstanding credit metrics so really proud of them we dont suspect anything different christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you for that in terms of maybe a question on the ratings downgrade which has gotten a lot of attention for the group does this change your business at all are there deposits that either are tied or correlated to your rating obviously we could argue if its backwardlooking or even right to begin with but is there any effect on your deposits from what happened umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no not long term we had there was a little disruption at the very beginning that monday after sbv failed where it cost us a little bit with a few clients but since then thats all recovered i would point you to something pretty important which is when the interest rates go up nine times in a year and the expectation of the fed is that we slow the economy guess what happens we slow the economy banks are a big part of that theres going to be a contraction in loan growth for the industry all of this is anticipated all of it is expected its a cyclical outcome of what the federal government is doing intended to slow the economy was it exacerbated slightly by what happened to svb sure but we have way way overblown the impact of two to failed banks and expecting that that had something to do with the rest of us you guys on the phone are way smarter than some of these market participants you ask way better questions that are researched and i would just suggest that we move on and stop talking about the rating agencies which add no value christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes thank you for that thats good context and then maybe one for ram if i could i think you said i want to be sure i got my notes midsingledigit growth in noninterest income thats on a fullyear over ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc in terms of to get to that number you mentioned billion coming off the bond portfolio i assume thatll get you redirected into the loan book is the assumption still there even with your slowing economy comments i mean last quarter you talked about doubledigit grower regardless is that still kind of baked into that or did you have temper that at all mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i might just reask make sure i got your question right do we expect the same kind of loan growth is that the question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah like what are the assumptions to get into that midsingle digit growth in nii i assume its the remixing of the balance sheet a little bit ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah everything that you said yeah in terms of i think we talked a little bit in our prepared comments about how were going to be really disciplined on asset pricing making sure that our asset betas are exceeding what we do on the deposit side so whatever that means for the market mariner also talked in his prepared comments about the expected contraction in just availability of credit umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp but that said one of our tenets of our investment thesis has always been outperformance in terms of loan growth so we still see opportunities we still see expansion opportunities in our verticals mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp our pipeline looks pretty good so its just no real softening of demand from what we see mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean i think naturally loan growth will slow that doesnt mean we stop growing i just think that naturally system wide loan growth will slow a little bit but thats off a pretty decent growth base anyway and you include solid asset pricing our ability we believe we can continue to have strong loan data and strong pricing discipline which coupled with what we believe will be a flattening of expansion on the deposit side will allow that mid single digit expansion that rams talking about ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah and you mentioned the billion of securities book so rolling off that slightly in order to handle the being reinvested into new loans thatll be a big part of net interest income driving as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats great thank you operator thank you chris operator instructions we have our next question comes from nathan race from piper sandler nathan your line is now open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi good morning everyone and i appreciate taking the questions nice quarter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning nathan umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co going back to the nii growth assumptions or guidance for is that contemplating one more fed rate hike in may and then have the fed on pause from there was that mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thats right yes ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats correct nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just in terms of some of the balance sheet dynamics of the quarter looks like you had about billion in shortterm debt i guess curious what the impetus behind that was and kind of what the near term or intermediate term plans are for that that was out of the quarter ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah ill take that so if you look at our balance sheet if you look at on the asset side our interestbearing deposit at balance was also elevated at close to billion which was up to a billion on a quarteroverquarter basis so its just out of abundance of caution that we had both sides of our balance sheet we did have some excess borrowings and they were parked at the fed account so were going to evaluate that periodically based on the current climate and environment but its not a long term obviously strategy for us to be dependent on a lot of wholesale funding mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp were watching it closely our expectation is that things continue to improve and normalize and we reduce those levels nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great so i guess under those kind of assumptions is the expectation that youve got to generally fund loan growth which it sounds like the pipeline is still pretty strong i mean second quarter with both cash flow commodities securities book and deposit growth as well going forward mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean we expect that we can continue to fund loan growth with deposits where were recentering i think as everybody is around relationship banking which is what weve always been i think its somewhat important to note that over the last decade you come off of the great recession banks like us benefited pretty handsomely from slight to safety so our balances grew then umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 and then you go into the pandemic and the government pumped money into the system and there was an enormous amount of excess liquidity dumped into the system which has been absorbed and during that time a few banks like ourselves and many others i think started placing some highquality loans on our balance sheet that maybe didnt come with as much deep relationship in deposits and if theres anything weve reminded ourselves over the last days its who we are and what weve always been which is a fantastic relationshipbased bank with really deep relationships and so i think how were going to go forward with funding our loans is well just be more recentered around deeper relationships and thats how we expect to fund loan growth going forward nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then turning to some of fee income drivers in the quarter it looks like you guys had a pretty strong quarter when it comes to funds services and the corporate trust and institutional segment is the rate of growth that we saw in those lines selfsustainable as you look out over the next few quarters or i guess what are some of the underlying kind of growth drivers that you guys are seeing in terms of new client adds and just overall pipelines within those segments mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah nate i think largely that a lot of it just coming from multiyear investments made in those businesses so we talked actually in the last few quarters about what the pipeline looks in fund services for example based on consolidation in the space and private equitybacked firms being sidelined for new business so weve benefited a lot by some of that pipeline actually coming to fruition on the fund services side for example and also obviously private equity has because of whats happened to the public and liquid markets private equity has been really strong over the last many years and continues to be and thats a strength for that space all of our investments in corporate trust are paying off we have that new office in europe in dublin that allows us to do business with more states as it relates to airline business if any of you have been in an airport recently you know that the travel business is on fire and therefore airlines are investing and so i just really kind of across the board the investments weve been making over the past many years have paid off we bought some health care accounts from old national our health care business is expanding growing broadening its just really across the board ill let jim talk youre probably going to say i said everything but ill james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management well you did but its a combination of new client acquisition but weve also had fees turned on mariner really did cover it but that business has been extremely steady and growing for us and the real contributor to our fee income growth and we dont see that slowing down for us any time soon mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 and our credit card we didnt mention this in the comments but we saw a spend go over billion for the first time in the last quarter thats in our debt you can find that in there so its really just kind of i would suggest hitting on all cylinders and as far as our business model goes you talked about the tightening of credit and the cycle that were in right now what weve said forever is our fee income buoys us and the diversity of our business model is what takes us through economic cycles like this and allows us to outperform against our peers and we dont expect that to be any different this time ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and whereas other banks are more reliant upon their mortgage operations for their fee income mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp right ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats just a friendly reminder thats completely different nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes that latter point is not lost on me if i could just ask one final one just going back to the office cre portfolio appreciate all the disclosures there technical difficulty across this portfolio to get to that average ltv disclosed in the deck and just generally how rent rolls are trending across that portfolio mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp im not sure ive heard that totally well did you hear that tom thomas s terry a executive vice president chief lending officer umb financial corp well if youre asking about loan to values the thing to remember is our average loan in the office portfolio is million when we underwrite out of the gate we dont trend rents and so were underwriting these to a lower sizing than a lot of our competitors do and so we by virtue of how we underwrite on the front end we do have lower loan to values that i think some of our competitors would have and again back to the nature of our portfolio being more suburban more low and moderate size versus a high risetype product weve not seen a lot of change in rental rates thus far but again a lot of our portfolio goes out past so we just havent seen it yet but today theyre performing as expected mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and our borrowers are all pretty large diversified borrowers with big portfolios of other that have cash flows and have the demonstrated capability to resize and if they need to but the real point about all this is how we do them umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 from the beginning how we underwrite from the beginning which is worst case we underwrite from the beginning with a worstcase scenario type of thinking and it gives us a lot of room nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate the color thanks everyone mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks nate operator thank you nathan we have no further questions on the line i will now hand back to the management team for any closing comments mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i dont think we have anything else to say appreciate it we had a great quarter and look forward to seeing you next
