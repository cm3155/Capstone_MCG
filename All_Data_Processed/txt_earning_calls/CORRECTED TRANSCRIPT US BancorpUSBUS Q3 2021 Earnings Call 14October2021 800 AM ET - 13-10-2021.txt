our prepared remarks terry and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the third quarter we reported earnings per share of and generated total revenue of billion our linkedquarter pretax preprovision net revenue growth of was driven by continued momentum across our fee businesses growth in average loan balances and continued focus on expense management resulting in positive operating leverage we released million of loan loss reserves this quarter supported by our outlook on the economy and betterthanexpected credit quality metrics turning to capital our book value per share totaled at september which was higher than june our cet1 ratio was at september slide provides key third quarter performance metrics including a return on tangible common equity of over slide highlights strong trends in digital engagement us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 on slide we are providing initial information about our business banking and payment relationships which we plan to update every quarter our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for us and provides a number of cyclical and secular growth opportunities over the next few years we believe there is a significant potential to expand and deepen relationships within this ecosystem our starting point is that we have about million business banking relationships which we define as businesses with under million in revenue currently about half of our payments customers of this size have a business banking product and just under onethird of our business banking customers have a payments product the opportunity is to both increase the number of business banking relationships and to deepen these relationships by connecting our banking customers with our payments products and services and connecting our payments customers with our banking products and services as we discussed previously we believe we can grow our small business relationships by to and related revenue by to over the next few years now let me turn the call over to terry who will provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends average loans increased compared with the second quarter driven by growth in other retail loans primarily installment loans as well as growth in credit card and residential mortgages this growth was partially offset by lower commercial loan balances which was impacted by lower levels of ppp loans at september ppp loan balances totaled billion compared to billion at june excluding ppp loans third quarter average loans grew by on a linkedquarter basis turning to slide average deposits increased compared with the second quarter and compared with a year ago on both a linkedquarter and yearoveryear basis we continue to benefit from favorable mix shift as average noninterestbearing deposits increased while higher cost time deposits declined slide shows credit quality trends nonperforming assets declined on both a linkedquarter and yearoveryear basis and our net chargeoff ratio hit a record low of basis points our reserve release was million this quarter primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics our allowance for credit losses as of september totaled billion or of loans the allowance level reflected our best estimate of the economic outlook and trajectory of credit quality within the portfolios slide provides an earnings summary in the third quarter of we earned per diluted share these results include a reserve release of million turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion increased by compared with the second quarter the growth was primarily driven by higher loan fees associated with the paycheck protection program us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 excluding ppprelated fees net interest income would have been stable reflecting lower loan yields and the impact of changing loan mix offset by the beneficial impact of core loan growth lower premium amortization and an additional day in the quarter our net interest margin was stable compared with the second quarter slide highlights trends in noninterest income compared with a year ago noninterest income declined as decreases in mortgage revenue and commercial products revenue more than offset strong growth in payments revenue trust and investment management fees deposit service charges and treasury management fees on a linkedquarter basis noninterest income increased reflecting higher than expected payments revenue and a increase in mortgage revenue driven by growth in production volume and related gain on sale margins as well as higher loan sales slide provides information on our payment services business our payments business continues to benefit from improving economic conditions and spend activity in the third quarter sales volumes for both our credit card and our merchant processing businesses exceeded the pandemic compared period in while cps volume was about in line as expected prepaid card volume declined in the third quarter as the impact of governmentrelated stimulus continues to diminish the reduced prepaid volume resulted in a slight decline in credit and debit card revenue on a linkedquarter basis however corporate payment revenues increased by which was better than expected driven by improving business spend activity merchant processing revenue increased by due to higher merchant and equipment fees as well as higher sales volumes turning to slide noninterest expense increased compared to the second quarter this increase primarily reflected higher revenuerelated compensation and performancebased incentives slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at september was which increased slightly compared to june at the beginning of the third quarter we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire mufgs union bank sic mufg union bank we expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second quarter of after the closing of the acquisition we expect to operate at a cet1 capital ratio between our target ratio and i will now provide some forwardlooking guidance as ppp winds down and we approach the end of the forgiveness period we expect ppp fees to decline million to million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter excluding the impact of ppp fees we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable on a linkedquarter basis we expect ppp to be immaterial to both net interest income and the net interest margin in in the fourth quarter we expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen driven by improving sales volumes however the fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower than the third quarter which affects linkedquarter comparisons in the fourth quarter we expect to see a seasonal increase in amortization of tax advantaged investments of approximately million as well as some seasonal impacts in marketing and business investments us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 credit quality remains strong over the next few quarters we expect the net chargeoff ratio to remain lower than normal for the full year of we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry to summarize our third quarter results were positive on several fronts highlighted by a solid growth in core loans good fee revenue momentum and strong credit quality we are finishing off the year in a strong position heading into and were excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across the franchise supported by our continued investment in people digital technology and data analytics our three payments businesses will continue to benefit from the improved spend activity particularly as consumer and business travel recovers towards prepandemic levels more importantly we believe our secular growth initiatives aimed at connecting payments with banking provide a meaningful potential for market share gains over the immediate and longer term our business banking initiatives are still in the early innings but were gaining traction and our partnership with state farm continues to evolve and grow we are encouraged by the results we are seeing aside from our organic growth opportunities our recently announced acquisition of union bank provides a platform to achieve cost synergies expand our distribution network in demographically attractive west coast markets and leverage our broad product set and leading digital capabilities across a loyal but underpenetrated customer base all of this will enable us to accelerate revenue and earnings growth and continue to deliver the industryleading returns on equity that our shareholders have come to expect in closing id like to thank our employees for all theyve done throughout the year well now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning andy and good morning terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc andy slide is very interesting and as you pointed out its a new slide two questions on this slide you talked about the growth that you are anticipating in that business banking area to get the customers that are business bankingonly to be both banking and payments what percentage can you get it to that that you have on the other circle with the payments area can you get it to that area and how long would it take you to get there and second if you put in the union bank customers how large will that million grow to andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so gerard union bank has about comparable customers so that would be added to the million and i do believe we can get to your first question that lefthand side to the at least again the way were thinking about this product set is really a combination a dashboard if you will that helps these customers manage their business payables receivables travel activity payroll and so forth in one comprehensive viewpoint and i think that will allow us to both deepen the relationships as well as expand so i do believe we can give that as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you guys are obviously well regarded on your credit through the full cycle and you pointed out terry that i think the basis points is a record low in net chargeoffs what do you anticipate when will things normalize and i hate that word because theres no such thing as normal credit chargeoffs but it seems like how sustainable are these record low levels do you think as we look out over the next to months terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 yeah its a great question and your point about it really being difficult to predict is right on when we end up looking at and kind of looking at forecast et cetera we do expect its probably going to stay at these lower levels for a few quarters and thats going to start to normalize probably it doesnt get back there until what we would define as normal which is kind of that basis points to basis points overall until at least the end of and probably sometime in but it is very hard to predict gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah no i agree thank you gentlemen terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i had a couple of questions one was on just loan growth in general and i wanted to understand where you see some signs of life that might be accelerating as we move into and into next year i ask because i saw a nice uptick in the consumer side but commercial seemed to be a little bit weaker im wondering if what youre seeing there thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so when we end up looking first of all maybe the fourth quarter we would expect probably modest growth going into the fourth quarter on a linkedquarter basis and if you just look at the puts and takes and i think that this will play out over time as well but the puts and takes at least in the near term is that we would continue to expect to see reasonably good growth in our auto lending business which has been very strong of late and we would also expect that our credit card balances would start to strengthen and a big part of that is both consumer spend but weve also been investing in terms of account growth and various sort of promotional activities so that will help to drive it and then as government stimulus kind of starts to dissipate which has i think been slowly doing we do expect that that payment rate will start to come down its really kind of at a historic high right now and as that comes down credit card balances should strengthen so certainly on the consumer side we expect growth in the near term the ci as you said is a little more challenging and the principal challenge there is that we continue to see a fair amount of payoffs and then ppp forgiveness is also dampening the ci growth in that particular space us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 where we are seeing nice areas of opportunity in ci is in assetbacked securitization type of lending mortgage warehouse lines some supply chain finance activities those are all areas that have been of particular strength when we end up looking at middle market space were seeing lots of confidence in terms of customers and relatively strong pipelines and so we do expect that that is an area of opportunity once we get beyond the drag of ppp so hopefully that gives you some perspective in terms of some of the puts and takes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the ppp in the fourth quarter i think you indicated it would be down obviously qonq but is it sizable in the fourth quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes it ends up coming down and you saw we talked a little bit about the decline this quarter i think its going to come down probably half of that again in the fourth quarter and then its hard to tell in terms of does it stabilize at that level or does it come down a little bit further but our expectation at least right now betsy is that by the end of the fourth quarter the vast majority of ppp has been forgiven and the impact to for example balances and net interest income and margin will be really immaterial when we think about betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and in the fourth quarter the ppp contribution to nii in the fourth quarter how would you size that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp i think its modest betsy the peak quarter certainly was the third quarter it becomes very modest in the fourth quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right and then just lastly as you think about the forward look here on integrating mufg usa union bank into your operation how should we be thinking about the trajectory of the efficiencies here because when you announced that deal and we had that conference call we obviously heard a lot about the cost saves that youre anticipating getting from the mufg usa side but im wondering is there a tech angle as well on your legacy platform that will also be enhanced this one plus one equal for example andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so i think just to remind you of the timeframes we did actually submit our application for the transaction on october so that is in our expectation is a close sometime late first quarter early second quarter with a conversion integration in the third into the fourth quarter of as we talked about on that call we would expect about of the savings the efficiencies to occur in that first year and as we also talked about betsy the real benefit here is we have the platform and its a lift and shift from what they do to our platform which allows for the majority of the cost savings and the second enhancement on that is us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 our platform has more capabilities and in my view it has more opportunities a better customer experience and more products and services so theres also a revenue component as well so in that line in that view yes it is more than just one plus one betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning i want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on the trends youre seeing in your payments business i know you had mentioned the increased spend activity wanted to see if you can give us a little bit more color on how that breaks out and then separately maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on what your expectation is at this time based upon the trends youre beginning to see in the payments side thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe let me take the first part and then andy can pipe in with respect to what were seeing as we go into so maybe as a comparable ph period versus first of all as we said the merchant and the card business is now above levels in the third quarter sales were about almost higher than in terms of merchant processing and if you end up looking at credit debit card a 20pluspercent above where it was in so those have made really nice recoveries id also keep in mind is that when you end up looking at a merchant as an example airline travel and entertainment is still down quite a bit and probably i would say flattened a bit in the third quarter simply because of the delta variant but as we think about going forward and as the delta variant subsides a bit we would expect that to start to accelerate again if you end up looking at the card business as i said credit card and debit card business the sales volumes have been quite strong relative to and thats driven by consumer spend the one thing that will end up impacting us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 card revenue is the fact that prepaid continues to come down as government stimulus dissipates but by the end of the year going into again the quarteroverquarter impact will be relatively immaterial and then the last thing i would just talk about is on the corporate payments side of the equation its pretty much at levels but the travel and entertainment or the te spend is still about to below and we would expect that to continue to normalize so we think that theres opportunity still there for that to continue to strengthen we have seen what i would say other commercial spend strengthening quarteroverquarter and we would expect that to continue as well andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think thats exactly right terry and just to summarize what terry said extravel airlines and entertainment activity spend is up versus prepandemic levels in that range or so and i would expect that to continue to increase into i think the real opportunity is in that travel category which as terry mentioned if you think about merchant or car whatever category you look at is down in that range as that recovers thats where a lot of opportunity exists as well as what terry mentioned in the corporate travel and entertainment which is down closer to john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you and then i know you mentioned on the expense side some marketing and business investments at least for the fourth quarter is there anything there that is going to carry through into as youre putting money into the business i know you recently launched the buy now pay later product so just curious if theres ongoing marketing and business investment that we should consider as we dial in expense expectations for terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think as we think about the level of investment probably doesnt go up significantly from here john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning just wanted a one followup with you on comments around loan growth specifically if you can address two things one just the outlook for cre lending as you think about next year given potential disruption from the just change in work from home et cetera how youre approaching cre lending and on the consumer side do you expect do we need to see a big drawdown in the us savings rate before you actually see consumer lending pick up substantially or as you pointed out the government stimulus programs fading away are enough to see some legs to that growth terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe to the first question with respect to cre we actually saw some growth on a linkedquarter basis in cre this quarter the project level pipelines things like that are reasonably strong as we think about the next couple of quarters though i think what we are seeing in the marketplace is pretty strong competition and so well have to watch and see what happens with respect to paydowns regarding return to office and some of those impacts when we end up looking at it maybe in terms of the areas to watch i think that as return to office occurs we are starting to see collateral valuations improving and were starting to see some of those trends improving as well and i think that that generally would be a positive thing in terms of cre investment by underlying developers and financiers but i think that for right now were just watching what sort of paydown levels occur because of competition and then on the consumer side of the equation i mean were actually seeing we do expect that credit card balances from here start to grow and possibly accelerate as we get into when you think about customers that are revolving type of customers i believe that with government stimulus starting to dissipate that they are going to be looking to credit products in terms of being able to support their consumer spend and weve continued to see relatively strong growth in auto lending and i would anticipate that will continue depending upon supply chain impacts associated with chips and things like that but overall were fairly bullish on consumer lending ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful color thank you and just on a separate note in terms of when you look at the stickiness of the deposit growth that weve seen over the last months if you could just talk to your outlook in terms of whether you expect deposit balances to continue to grow and do you at any point as you look forward in the next year or two expect deposit growth to actually turn negative in any meaningful way terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah our deposit growth has been reasonably strong but particularly if you peel back the onion its been particularly strong in the consumer and business banking areas with yearoveryear growth of about linked quarter growth at about in the third quarter so i would fully expect that a lot of that will stick depending upon obviously the excess savings rate that we talked about were also seeing growth in the wealth management businesses and we would expect that a fair amount of that would stick as well us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 so as we think about deposits we think we have been growing what i would call the core balances quite a bit as liquidity does come out of the system though i would expect that we would see some runoff or where investors start to utilize those deposits to invest in like cdo clo sort of structure so within our wealth managementinvestment services business we would expect to see some runoff ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking my question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i was hoping terry you might be able to address the durability of mortgage revenues at the current level i thought it was a pretty solid quarter a little better than i had anticipated im just hoping you can address some of the puts and takes given margin origination levels and just overall durability of this quarters level terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah great question obviously in the third quarter we saw a little bit of an uptick with respect to applications because of refinancing activities when interest rates came down i would say scott that over the course of the last several years weve been making a significant amount of investment in a couple of different things one is a strong focus on purchase money area and a fairly significant amount of our volume is on the purchase money side so home sales to the extent that continues to grow should allow us to hold up really well and the second thing is that weve invested a lot in the retail channel and our digital capabilities and were taking nice market share in the mortgage banking space so while mortgage banking revenue will trend in the same sort of way as the industry i think that we do have the opportunity to be able to outperform the industry us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp agree r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thank you and then i was hoping for maybe a little more color on expenses particularly that comment you made earlier about the million seasonal increase in amortization of taxadvantaged in the fourth quarter does that go up and then come all the way back down or is there sort of a headwind that emerges in and then presumably its a wash from an earnings standpoint given a corresponding tax impact how should we be thinking about as we go through the fourth quarter and then ph thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah great question so what ends up happening in that particular space is about of the overall production for the year happens in the fourth quarter and so if you look historically we always see a blip in the fourth quarter and then it comes back down in the first quarter and then it slowly builds and then we see another blip in the fourth quarter of the following year so its usually its a seasonal thing in the fourth quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay good thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks a lot hey good morning guys terry can you just make sure we understand the offset to that million in expenses where we see that in the income statement terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah where that ends up flowing through is in the tax rate and usually what that ends up happening is on a lag basis so youll start to see the tax rate improving in as a result of the investments were making today ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay and in the fourth quarter do you see that offset to the million in the tax rate as well terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp very limited in the tax rate in the fourth quarter thats why we guide us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc its more of a forward terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah its really more forwardlooking ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you secondly you mentioned in the press release that fee waivers were down a little bit can you give us an update on what they were in the quarter and also what you need from rates to get rid of the fee waivers andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so they were about just about million in the third quarter down just a couple of million dollars versus the second quarter principally due to the repo rate we get about of it back with the first basis points and about of it back with the second basis points ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then just last one in terms of the payments businesses again like so on merchant when we see growth in can you just compare and contrast when we see growth in the volumes i know its mix dependent but just with your mix of business whats the correlation between increases and improvements in merchant visàvis the improvements that we see in the sales volumes thanks guys andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp typically whats happening right now is a mix change so whats coming back are some of the areas they have a little thinner margin which is whats causing the differential on sales being up about and fees being down about and so thats partly and this is im using these numbers versus and if you look at it versus sales were up about and fees are up about so therell be a bit of a gap there partly because of the mix of whats coming back and as we look forward i would expect a bit of a differential revenue growth being slightly below sales growth on a goforward basis ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay sorry can i ask just one more i forgot to ask about the expense you had on the airline and travel was that a onetime update and was that meaningful can you tell us how much that was andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp the expense on airline and travel i think are you talking about the investments that were making on our credit card business or because us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah the ph network expenses andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp it goes principally terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp are you talking about the merchant airline reserve ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc exactly andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i mean that has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters because fundamentally youve got terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp people are flying andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp people are starting to fly terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp right so that has been not material ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 hey matt terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you guys give us an update on your rate sensitivity the flexibility to add securities or swaps and how the ub deal might impact that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe just the last question first the union bank is a little bit more assetsensitive than we are and we would expect that they would probably add to our asset sensitivity in that basis points to basis points range where were at today if you end up looking at first second quarter we are at about assetsensitive to a 50basispoint shock weve been expanding that matt in a couple of different ways weve been holding more cash looking for a better investment entry point and so that asset sensitivity has been coming up and in addition to that we have been just looking at different hedge strategies that have been expanding our asset sensitivity as well so today its probably about kind of asset sensitivity and thats the position that were at right now we do have the opportunity and we have the expectation that rates are going to start moving up at least on the long end and so were trying to be patient and be in a position to be opportunistic when rates are in the right spot matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just separately a clarification question on payments when you talk about the seasonality in maybe remind us what that is and i guess i was thinking its on the corporate payment side which may not be as seasonal this year as normal but just elaborate on that and im digging in just because last quarter you said you thought payments would be flat and ends up being a little bit better than expected and it seems like it might be a conservative guide again for thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes usually merchant is flat to down a little bit so its seasonally affected in the fourth quarter card actually performs a little bit better in the fourth quarter because of holiday sales but cps is the business that ends up coming down because you have a significant amount of government spend in the third quarter matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc we got our new slide the slide talking about combining banking with payments but if you could just elaborate a little bit more i think i heard you say what are we looking at were looking at of banking customers what are we looking at its a lot of banking customers dont use payments is the bottom line and you want to get them to use it and half of your payments customers dont use banking services you want them to use that too and i think you said you seek to grow the small business relationship by to and related revenues by to over what timeframe is that and how are you going to do that and when are you rolling out some of the new products that are going to help enable that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike first you got the numbers correct second this starts at million customers we have about another that would be added with union bank the timeframe is the next few years well continue to add to this slide to give you more specifics including the progress on these numbers as well as the thinking about revenue the way were going to do this is by a combined dashboard and product offering that has both payments and banking on that dashboard to help those businesses run their company payables receivables travel payroll as well as banking products and services we have been rolling out that dashboard making enhancement to it as we speak and well continue to do it each and every month each and every quarter and thats the way we think about it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so i guess how do you think about the profit margins on these relationships it seems like we provide more onestop shopping it should be better service for the customer and you should be making more on that so not just the revenues what would you expect the earnings to increase by i assume more than the to andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes i was quoting a revenue number i would expect the earnings to be higher than that because the marginal cost of many of these products and services is not as high because they go on the platforms we already have established us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then lastly since were on the topic of tech its been six years since us bancorp has shown positive operating leverage you have two quarters in a row it looks like maybe on a linkedquarter basis you showed it maybe you wont show that in the fourth quarter you didnt talk about linkedquarter operating leverage but can you commit to having positive operating leverage i guess therell be some noise with union but are you on that trajectory now and if so why andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike there will be some noise with union as you mentioned its always our goal weve made a lot of investments in the company and those investments are going to do two things theyre going to drive revenue growth and theyre going to also create more efficiencies in terms of our operations and the tech stack modernization in particular creates a less expensive operating environment so i think those are all positives as we look into thats always our objective will depend a bit upon the yield curve and what happens with rates but thats our objective mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure mike operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning vivek terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc morning andy morning terry a couple of questions can you investment securities they shrank any color on the outlook terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah our expectation again is that when we think about longerterm rates we do expect them to be moving up given the inflationary pressures and other things that are kind of just in terms of economic growth so we have us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 been holding off with respect to reinvestment of maturities and things like that and building cash balances to improve our asset sensitivity and well look for opportunities to reinvest that in the future as rates start to move vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks another one different topic did i hear you say that you expect revenue growth in payments fees to be better than sales trends and if so can you elaborate andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp vivek the other way around so the sales number will be a bit higher than the revenue growth partly because of mix partly because of the investments were making so for example on card as we have the sales growth occurring some of the investments in new business generation comes through and impacts the revenue growth vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay great thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp okay sure vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay operator and your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning i wanted to follow up on the relatively softer commercial loan growth that you guys are seeing are you hearing anything from your commercial customers that suggest that the depressed line utilization rates are really just an extension of the supply chain problems that theyre having and if so does that suggest that line utilization is unlikely to improve until the supply chain problems are resolved any color you can give on that would be great terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes obviously the supply chain is impacting customers in terms of their ability to be able to offer products and services et cetera but it hasnt necessarily come up in topic conversation with them certainly i do think that as supply chain challenges start to resolve themselves that that will create opportunity for us in terms of line us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 utilization and bank financing but its not something that has been discussed a lot with clients lets put it that way or that they brought up bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats helpful separately on the merchant acquiring business the elavon business certainly puts you guys in a unique position to be able to turn on buy now pay later solutions for your merchant partners in a way that other banks cant can you discuss whether youre considering offering buy now pay later solutions to your merchant customers and separately and i guess a broader question how do you guys think about bnpl does it pose disintermediation risk to your card business or is that bnpl customer really more likely someone who typically would not even qualify for a credit card and so bnpl is essentially just something that theyre using that allows them to turn their debit card into a credit card and it also helps merchants drive incremental sales any thoughts around how you guys are thinking about it and the opportunity if you see one andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah bill so i think its a little of both of the topics you brought both of the ways you described it so first of all we have a number of test cases going on we already offer buy now pay later on our credit card offering sometimes a customer wants to have a large purchase specific from a payment plan and that could be a current credit card customer choosing to have a very planned set of payments going forward at other times buy now pay later can allow for a customer who would otherwise not have a credit card to acquire or purchase something using the buy now pay later capability and in that sense you do partner with the merchants to increase the sales base of that merchant portfolio so were working on all those fronts bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and my other questions have been largely addressed but if i could squeeze in one last one on a separate topic you guys recently announced that youll be providing cryptocurrency custody services for your institutional clients could you frame the revenue opportunity there and some large banks ceos have indicated that they cant provide cryptocurrency custody services but it would be great andy if you could discuss whats different in the way that usb is thinking about providing custody and what gives you guys comfort doing that at a time when theres still some controversy and i guess unwillingness among some large players around providing those services andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah so let me step back our institutional investors are looking to participate in the digital currency market as an investment class we have a large fund services business that provides fund services transfer agency and fund administration to those clients if an asset class that they choose to have is one that we need to be able to provide a service for and well now offer cryptocurrency custody for those fund managers and thats the way were thinking about it so it is really providing a service that we do for their other asset classes for cryptocurrency and weve selected nydig to help us bancorp usb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 us with that from a subcustodian standpoint and actually a number of other banks do that as well sometimes for their own customer base bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and the revenue opportunity any high level color on that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp we havent defined the revenue opportunity its early innings of this capability certainly and so it is really providing a full set of services to those customers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you so much for taking my questions andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator we have a followup question from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey sorry sorry for the followup but you gave us the million to million expected decline in ppp in the fourth quarter i was just wondering thats the first time youve given us a number do you have the base of what it was total ppp net interest income in terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah it was about million ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you very much operator and at this time there are no further questions ill turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp maybe one comment jen asked me to clarify something in the transcript or when i was earlier i mentioned that the share buyback program would be deferred until second quarter actually it will be the second half of after about a quarter after we finished the closing us bancorp usb corrected
