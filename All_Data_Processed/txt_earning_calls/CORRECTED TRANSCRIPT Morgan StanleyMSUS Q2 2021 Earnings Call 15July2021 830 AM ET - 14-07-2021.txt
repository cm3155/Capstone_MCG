reproduced without our consent i would now turn the call over to chairman and chief executive officer james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hi good morning everyone and thank you for joining us the firm delivered another strong quarter and a record first half with yeartodate revenues in excess of billion we had strong inflows across wealth and investment management and in the first six months of the year we added over billion of net new assets across both of those businesses we now have over million unique relationships in wealth management and in investment management our asset mix is increasingly diverse and well positioned in key secular growth areas such as customization private alternatives and sustainability finally institutional securities also had a tremendous performance equity morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 remains the preeminent leader in the industry fixed income has maintained share gains and our leading investment banking franchise performed strongly our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of etrade and eaton vance and the progress on our integrations since the respective announcement of each acquisition both businesses have performed better than we expected not only did the standard merger metrics such as synergies and funding benefits read positive but much more importantly weve seen longterm business growth driven by exceptional client engagement this quarter our rotce was and yeartodate were over obviously were exceeding our longer term targets of 17plus we intend to formally revisit our goals next january while we will not revisit targets mid year i want to assure you were as focused on delivering top performance as ever though were always subject to the broader macro environment we will strive for continued outperformance now let me talk about the decision we announced two weeks ago on further capital distribution during the financial crisis we reduced our buyback to zero and cut our dividend quarterly to per share over the past decade it has been a slow steady path of improvement as we grow our dividend from ultimately to and increased our buyback from to billion i have said for a number of years that wealth and investment management contributes durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially and that is what we are doing as a result we reset our dividend doubling it to per share and also increased our buyback up to billion over the next months we made this decision because of the confidence we have in our business model and our performance over the past three federal reserve stress tests these tests confirmed what weve said for many years morgan stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital and we have the ability to invest in our business do acquisitions maintain a very healthy dividend yield and increase our buyback given our current earnings momentum it may take some time to fully distribute our capital but we feel strongly that this year is the time to make a big start now sharon yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as chief financial officer jon pruzan who was cfo up until midway through the second quarter is also here with us and as you know jon took on additional responsibilities as our chief operating officer since june so let me turn over to sharon who will discuss the quarter in detail and we look forward to all of your questions thank you sharon yeshaya chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the second quarter representing one of the top three quarters on record performance continued to be very strong reflecting high levels of client activity across our businesses excluding integrationrelated expenses our eps was our rotce was yeartodate revenues of billion were a new record highlighting the power of our firm which has been further enhanced by our recent acquisitions investing for growth remains a priority while also managing our expense base on a yeartodate basis total expenses were billion of which noncompensation expenses were billion and compensation expenses were billion the increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of etrade and eaton vance and the integrationrelated costs yeartodate our firm efficiency ratio declined to excluding integrationrelated expenses underscoring the operating leverage of our business morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 now to the businesses institutional securities revenue of over billion demonstrates the power of the integrated investment bank revenues declined by from the exceptionally strong prior year higher revenues in investment banking and equities were offset by lower fixed income results underwriting was particularly robust as issuance remained elevated and despite lower volatility across asset classes our sales and trading clients remained engaged we ended the period on a strong footing as clients were active through june investment banking revenues were billion the increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and continued strength in equity underwriting from a geographical perspective results in europe and asia were the strongest in over a decade and while technology and health care remain areas of core strength activity and financial institutions financial sponsors real estate and other sectors supported higher revenues advisory revenues were million reflecting increased completed ma activity versus the prior year yearto date announced industry volumes reached record levels and clients continued to look for strategic opportunities as markets remain open and constructive equity underwriting revenues of billion were the second highest on record and the third consecutive quarter over billion the increase from the prior year was driven by traditional ipos where activity remains robust globally fixed income underwriting revenues of million were also the second highest after a record second quarter of last year investment banking pipelines remained healthy across products and regions ceo confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities for growth equity revenues increased from the prior year to billion we are number one in this business globally revenues were the second highest in over a decade results in asia were particularly strong reflecting increased interest in the region from both asia and nonasiabased clients cash and derivative results were robust but declined versus the prior year against the backdrop of lower volatility prime brokerage revenues were strong and increased versus last year as average balances reached new highs fixed income revenues were billion revenues declined from the exceptional prior year as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products this quarters results were broadbased across regions micro results were robust compared to historical averages but declined from the prior year as credit markets were relatively rangebound and bid offer spreads compressed macro also declined versus last year with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange on the back of lower volatility other revenues of million declined versus the prior year the decrease primarily reflects lower marktomarket gains on corporate loans net of related hedges prioryear results benefited from significant credit spread tightening turning to isg lending our allowance for credit losses in isg loans and lending commitments was essentially flat in the second quarter at billion isg provisions were million and net chargeoffs were million primarily related to one facility total isg loans were flat the decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by growth in all other lending categories lending commitments increased by approximately billion relative to the prior quarter turning to wealth management the prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period rather than the prior year given the acquisition of etrade revenues were a record billion excluding integrationrelated costs of million ebt was also a record of billion with a margin of growth drivers of this business remain robust net new assets were billion in the quarter bringing yeartodate nna to billion which represents a annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half net new clients asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results further we continued to see strength in net recruiting and retention also contributing to nna while nna will be morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth potential inherent in this business transactional revenues were billion excluding the impact of dcp revenues declined from the exceptional prior quarter client activity moderated from the first quarters torrid pace but engagement remained high selfdirected daily average trades were million in the second quarter approximately above average levels for full year our client base continues to expand and our households reached million in the self directed channel asset management revenues increased sequentially to billion yeartodate these revenues increased feebased flows were billion bringing yeartodate feebased flows to billion almost matching the amount for the full year of feebased assets are now trillion or more than double the level of only five years ago bank lending balances grew by a record billion and balances reached billion in the second quarter yeartodate balances have grown by exceeding our fullyear expectation of this was driven by strong demand for securitiesbased lending net interest income was billion excluding prepayment amortization which declined approximately million sequentially nii was up slightly the benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve we have realized the fully phasedin synergies that we expected for for nii going forward billion is a reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year we expect nii to build from this level as we anticipate loans to grow more in line with levels the integration of etrade is going well and we continue to prioritize the client experience while early we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals the workplace channel continues to show momentum as we win equity plans and our number of participants now stands at million financial wellness plans are also gaining traction we had four times as many wins yearoveryear moving to investment management because the timing of the close of the eaton vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult i will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis revenues were billion total aum reached trillion and total net flows were over billion since we announced the acquisition at the beginning of october pro forma net flows were approximately billion the increased diversification of this business was a significant driver of results total aum increased from the prior quarter and stands at a record high of which longterm aum reached trillion the benefit of our broadened product offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter inflows across products resulted in over billion of longterm net flows we saw particular strength in alternatives and solutions driven primarily by demand for parametric customized portfolios as well as a billion strategic multiasset partnership mandate we continued to see strong client momentum in our private credit and core real estate platforms loan strategies in fixed income were particularly robust asset management and related fees were billion more than doubling from the prior year driven by strong aum growth and the addition of eaton vance performancebased income and other revenues were million in the quarter reflecting broadbased strength across the private alternatives portfolio with the integration on pace our very strong position in customization sustainability alternatives valueadded fixed income and high conviction equity investing positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients turning to the balance sheet indiscernible assets were essentially flat standardized rwas increased to billion our standardized cet1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at compared to our cet1 requirement including the scb of during the second quarter we repurchased approximately billion of common stock or million shares our tax rate for the quarter was morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 the second quarter results were strong and balanced looking ahead while we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown we are starting the third quarter from a position of strength investment banking pipelines are healthy dialogues are active and markets are open wealth management continues to retain and attract new clients new advisors and new assets investment management should continue to benefit from the increased diversification of the platform with that we will now open the line to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much you piqued my interest youve made comments around investing for growth remains a priority weve seen so much that youve done across asset and wealth management my question is in isg youre as good as ph it gets i think in equities and ma where do you see opportunities to invest andor capture share across isg right now james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey glenn i think firstly i wouldnt i certainly wouldnt and ill come back to it in a minute discount growth opportunities across im and wealth even though weve just done these huge acquisitions so ill come back to that in the institutional business listen theres more consolidation going on in prime brokerage were the market leader in that we will pick up share over time clearly in ma theres opportunity for us to grow i think that a lot of the middlemarket ma space is very fertile there are different parts of the world where we still think we could punch above our weight so i actually think both of those the equities business as good as it is and the ma as good as it is i actually think theres real upside in both of those in the fixed income space our aspiration years ago was to do billion ph a quarter we raised it to billion and here we are in a sort of soso quarter of billion as rates normalize and as the fixed income fee pool will inevitably grow i see a lot of ph the space there in the spg credit side weve got a worldclass business there again continuing to grow share and our commodities business is doing very well so the isg franchise has gone from sort of running at billion a quarter to this quarter it was billion it was frankly better than wed expected coming into it which is terrific but its very interesting i mean the share gains across and its not just us some of the other big players in the us are real and i think enduring and as the global economies recover and the fee pool increases youll just see more of that so i feel very confident about the isg business glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that and i hear you loud and clear on asset and wealth management i do have a quick followup within wealth management obviously shareworks is just enormous opportunity wonder if you could just give us morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 a little marktomarket in terms of whats going on in terms of conversions in the core business and then what is going on in terms of leading towards retaining business within the morgan stanley platform sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley couldnt hear the last part of your question but i think you said referrals throughout and how the integration on workplace is going glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so id say that youre sort of starting with infrastructure its going very well as james said but the core is start with infrastructure make sure that everyone has companion accounts as you go through so weve said were at right now where clients have companion accounts by the back half of next year we should be around and weve started pilot programs where you do have that companion account and we do see it working we see the retention of assets we see clients moving over to actually get advice when they look and want advice so were working with the clients and were trying out new technologies and well go from there so its really about conversion of clients and then the retention of assets but it all seems to be working very well james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley id just say something so offpiste a little bit here because it wasnt in your question but youve given me an opportunity to comment based on shareworks i think every now and then in business you look and you sort of see a wave coming and you catch the wave and its a beautiful thing the whole workplace space to me is the next major growth area in financial services i think over the next years well look back at the solium transaction which at the time some people thought was expensive and it was i think we spent million or million on it it might have been canadian dollars so somewhere around there and it was trading at about ph million value that gave us the opportunity to do the etrade transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace businesses and create shareworks and i really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions of clients ultimately into being morgan stanley and etrade clients as we have the accounts that fold into our own house accounts so thats one wave parametrics sic parametric the customization space i think is the second wave calvert funds and everything weve done through our own sustainability ph institute efforts combined with now calverts products and then the digitalization on how were going to take the etrade platform both domestically and internationally i think theres incredible opportunity so its pretty rare to sit here and having done this for a little while there are a lot of things that you can do to just improve your business but these are things where i think we have fundamental market forces pushing these waves and were right on top of them so its very exciting operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions and id like to just start by saying congrats to sharon welcome to the calls in a different role the quarterly dance here congrats sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure so id like to maybe start with the integrations and sort of taking a step back youve got two pretty substantial deals under your belt theyve now closed and so youre working on integrating those businesses what are the milestones that we should think about as you proceed with that work what kind of timeframe should we think about around updates are we going to just get back to the annual strategic update where its the fourth quarter call or are they going to be more regular updates where were going to be able to hear about the work that youre doing james you made reference to the workplace which is obviously a key part of etrade but how should we think about those from here i know its kind of a broad question but just want to try and level set sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think that its a fair question and in terms of where that comes out it will likely be the next step will be the annual deck but then from that point on i think therell be a more regular cadence so obviously most investors here know jed finn for example who can begin to take us through some of that workplace but theres also i think the goal will eventually be to better understand where there are participant migrations so how do you think about the question that glenn asked which is referrals how do you see that referral channel going through in terms of dollars et cetera how are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds falling through from those companion accounts but the integration is a threeyear process which we put out there at the very beginning so i think right now what were looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isnt working so to give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early i think would also be a mistake because wed like to ensure that it is the right client experience and thats what were focused on right now brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then when we think about net new assets the growth there has been really pretty impressive we have seen some acceleration across the industry though and i think most investors think its going to slow this past year has been a little unusual but when we look at whats been happening at morgan stanley things already were accelerating before we entered into this period and so one of the debates that has been coming up more regularly has been what is the right growth rate for the wealth business on a goforward basis ill maybe throw out a range and from my perspective it feels like somewhere in the mid to uppersingle digits to feels fair on a longrun basis but number one id love to hear your reaction to that and then number two how do you think about that growth rate do you guys have something in mind is there something that youre targeting any color on that would be really helpful morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i want sharon start and ive got a few thoughts about this sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i mean i think where we started brennan if we look back to the beginning of the year we gave you guys a very long historical average chart and then we showed you the of the pro forma when you included etrade now what we have said is we dont think wed go back to a to sort of on a sustainable basis so that to is where james spoke to this audience at the beginning of the year when we talked about the deck obviously as you look forward though were doing a lot both on net asset consolidation net recruiting and all of these new channels and so i dont think the same way that james level set with the targets at the beginning of his introductory remarks id say we dont thats probably the same way you can think about this where to maybe thats the right place to start but were obviously not going to try to underachieve that number james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah brennan its really the its the the question right because if we can generate growth in the highteens i mean i think what are we yeartodate organic i mean this is just weve never seen this right and ive been doing this for a very long time the three industry segments basically the wire houses sort of independentrias and the direct channel for years the direct has grown the rias have grown in large part because theyve taken advisors have moved out of the traditional channel into the ria channel so part of the growth has just been a shift if you will part of its been organic and the wire houses have sort of struggled and theyve struggled for a couple of reasons one is poor training two is very high attrition three is lack of luring the clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have et cetera and i think what youre seeing now we think were kind of creating not to be arrogant about it but a new mousetrap were creating an advisor channel which actually has deep organic growth flavors in it and if you look at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers i mean theyre fantastic and with that were getting tremendous asset growth and then you combine that with having the direct platform and then combine that with having the workplace platform youve got three legitimate channels pouring assets into the house and it wasnt so long ago that if we did billion a quarter we thought we were pretty good and we just had a billion quarter during tax season and its good i mean its very good but we dont think it was a fluke so i dont know where the ultimate number is going to settle i think our assets in wealth are now around a little over trillion they were at billion years ago so were at trillion weve gone up nine times compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force as you know so i dont know if its going to it wont be below and in any individual quarter you have stuff going on but it wont be below whether its where we land on that well see over a few years but it feels good operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 hi good morning and welcome sharon nice to have you on the call wanted to start off with just a twoparter on wealth management and nii you noted that the etrade funding synergies have been captured for the deposit cost in wealth management still feels a bit elevated at bps especially when benchmarking versus peers just wondering if theres potential to drive those funding costs lower if rates remain at zero and then just as a second part maybe just speak to the environmental factors supporting such strong sbl growth and the sustainability of that trend sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i would just mention that we did see the planned runoff right of wholesale deposits and we continue to expect another billion of wholesale deposits to run off by yearend as we see some of that highercost funding roll down so just to note there i dont have an exact target on sort of bdp costs but that will give you a sense in addition to that i would just highlight the sbl question that you asked that product is resonating with our clients so thats the point there and as james has always said its a product in which you lend wealthy clients their money back and this is something that is resonating its structured very well weve historically seen minimal losses and it has a ltv right now in that portfolio so from that perspective i think its a good product to offer and its also something that works especially in a season like this where you generally see a lot of that product in tax season and so there is an elevated number in the second quarter generally speaking steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just for my followup on capital management the dividend increase that we saw was much higher than anticipated it looks like youre now running with the highest dividend yield amongst all of the gsibs i know james you had alluded to the improved stress test outcomes the higher contribution from recurring revenues but just remind us of the philosophy around setting the dividend and buyback and where youre running on your cap where youre comfortable running on your capital ratios on a throughthecycle basis james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i mean theres a lot in that steve so it might take a little while get yourself a cup of coffee put your feet up on the stool steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc indiscernible james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley so lets just start with i think were a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever unless we go and screw it up basically if you look at the daily numbers coming out of the feebased businesses and the wealth business and the feebased businesses and asset management theyre for real and theyre every day and theyre not million theyre million so youve kind of locked in a billion business right from day one in the beginning of the year and our view on that is unless we spend our way into trouble on it it would generate very consistent earnings and just philosophically it doesnt mean im right but my view was certainly the wealth business and the feebased part of the asset management business which is so predictable we think of it as like as a yield stock and the investment banking and trading businesses and capital markets businesses morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 and some of the carry businesses and asset management we think is like not that the other business isnt a growth stock but that provides the capital to fund the engine to do buybacks et cetera et cetera weve been carrying a buffer of cet1 of over we have to be i think the latest ccar was around ish i dont know what the exact buffer we should carry internally is weve said basis points it wouldnt be less than that but just pretend its basis points youre at youve got 300plus basis points to play with were generating net income in the first half of this year it was billion assume were less than that in the second half just because who knows but were certainly not going to be under billion for the year and probably not under billion so youre talking about a buyback of billion a dividend of billion that gets you to billion youre generating at least billion youre in the hole for billion but youve got basis points of excess its going to take a bunch of years to eat into that and we felt our shareholders deserve to get the earnings stream up the predictability of the businesses that weve got were not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be and the vast majority of them if not all of them went out of business or merged we are a combined investment bank with a massive wealth and asset management business so we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile 14pointwhateveritwas8 billion in revenue this quarter a little over billion of it was institutional a little over billion of it was wealth and asset management so its exactly what we hoped this sort of balance thats the philosophy now it would take us a bunch of years unless ccar changes dramatically for us to get close to our buffer and were buying the stock back and the stocks over were very happy buying at this level but at some point obviously that gets expensive we do think we can do more deals over time and well actively look at that and we want to keep investing in the business but the reality is and this is like the ultimate conundrum we can do all four buy back dividend invest in acquisitions and still run an excess buffer and the only way out of that problem is not to have good earnings and thats not my solution currently so lets play this out over a few years im really happy we got the dividend as we called it a reset and we have the authorization from the board for up to billion and well go hard at that particularly if we saw a big move in the market but thats how im thinking about it and how the board is thinking about it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning this is actually bernie von gizycki on for matt so my questions are on investment management and the inclusion of eaton vance in last quarters 10q you noted that certain eaton vance products have lower average fee rates than the standalone morgan stanley investment management platform i know you made some revisions to the aum disclosures and eaton vance only had one month of performance in the data in could you just talk about the expectations on fee rate in the combined asset management platform as you diversify the product mix sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i think that thats right obviously thats in some of the overlay products for example well have lower fee rates it will obviously be a mixed product also if you think about it just across the platform you might see other gives and takes but i think that what were focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product its morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 creating an ability to service the client more broadly so while the overall fee rate might come down as was disclosed there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform which would offset parts of that on a total basis right a rate times volume kind of concept in particular you have the parametric product which we discussed which is obviously has its own secular growth trends the calvert product and then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular trends ie esg ie whats going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized portfolios all of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in aum and in addition to that i think that the fixed income products offered the clients an ability to bring their entire portfolio to morgan stanley and so from that perspective again rate times volume over time and so there will be a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio but ph assets should continue to come in bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you thats helpful and then just my followup again i know its just the first full quarter of eaton vance just combined on the platform but just any color you can share about the integration efforts around like putting eaton vances products on your international distribution channel and then vice versa putting some of your core products on eaton vances domestic retail platform just trying to get a sense of anything with the net flows showed up thanks sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley id say weve aligned the sales forces but as you noted it has not been that long were working through it i think we see and we expect to invest in the various businesses to deliver the customization for a better client experience but also open the new workplaces so not just international but also as it relates to workplace et cetera so were still working through that and we should have an update over the course of the rest of the year james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley but the short answer on the flows is zero of the flows to my knowledge are a result of exactly what you just said putting the eaton vance product in international and putting our product through the wholesalers in eaton vance theyre terrific teams therell be a lot of upside on that going forward but zero of it has appeared yet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of christian bolu with autonomous your line is now open christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning james and sharon and just echo the sentiments a big congrats to you sharon james maybe actually a couple followups on things youve said on prior questions i think you just said maybe a couple questions before that you mentioned you can do more ma deals just trying to get a sense of what youre thinking there is that doubling down on wealth management or is it consolidating traditional asset management space as you look to grow to trillion in client assets morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah christian good morning weve done i think five deals acquisitions since the crisis and weve had a lot of dispositions disposals i guess transmontaigne indiscernible we spun off msci obviously before this we spun off discover pdt ph to set our business frontpoint we shut so folks have focused on the acquisition side but weve also done a huge number of deals in getting rid of businesses that are better owned by somebody else or just werent a fit now ph azores in spain i remember quilter in the uk european private banking business we sold et cetera so on the deal side weve done smith barney obviously was the big one and mesa west was the first sort of toe in the water in investment management then the solium deal in the workplace space followed by etrade and eaton vance so all im saying is we dont have big transactions in line of sight at this point of time but were a big enough company were generating i dont know were running run rate i guess is billion in revenues this year 170plus billion market cap finding the right things to fit in particularly internationally and particularly on the digital and technology side is very interesting to us now pricing as always youve got to be disciplined but its just its something that were very watchful of and were not shy about it but major transactions are highly unlikely to happen these are more boltons as they feel right christian bolu q analyst autonomous research great thanks and just a followup you keep mentioning international i think you said etrade you want to expand that international which i dont think ive heard before and if i remember correctly in the past you were always cautious about wealth management international expansion i mean you just said you divested quilter and etrade ph closed its international business ph post financial crisis so just can you just talk more about how you think about international how you would expand etrade whats the sort of like vision here james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure ill try and be brief the international wealth business is complicated because while the us market is million people and europe is about million people europe is multiple jurisdictions within that even though its the eurozone asia people look at as though its some monolith its not vietnam is not indonesia malaysia is not thailand the philippines is not australia korea is not china et cetera et cetera so its very hard to get scale in these markets thats issue number one issue number two they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets theyre not the diversified traditional financial planning market look at japan the velocity of asset in japan compared to the us its night and day and thirdly obviously know your client money laundering all of the things that one has to be careful about crossbordertype money flows the bar is very high and were a conservative institution we just are so my view has been for a long time that you trade very carefully you go where youve got scale weve done that in latam because weve basically run it out of miami and new york so we run it as a region as distinct from single countries and you go and weve done it in hong kong where we deal with a lot of wealthy asian clients out of hong kong and singapore a little bit in australia but basically you go where you have scale so the more attractive path forward is likely to be through digital and electronic under the brand and with good products rather than trying to build up thousands of people in i dont know malaysia and indonesia hence etrade becomes a very interesting platform for that early days thats the the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do internationally but thats something id be very excited about morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi this is the first call since you announced the partnership with microsoft to accelerate your cloud development can you talk about what you hope to achieve with that with any concrete metrics possible and ultimately how much do you expect to have of your processing on the public cloud or the private cloud and otherwise on premise james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i dont think i have off the top of my head all of those details mike we do have a major deal with microsoft but were also working with other cloud providers i wont name them on the call but we have a longterm contract weve just done with microsoft its all part of the reimagination of our technology organization and its come through some programs that weve put in place internally around agile and something we call pace that are basically designed to move this organization into this century which i think theyve done a fantastic job of weve created a group of what we call the distinguished engineers and interestingly and people dont think of it this way but i think weve done the biggest move in technology of any of the large banks maybe in the world by spending billion on a technology company called etrade which is basically technology and brand so the microsoft deal is a very important one but its not the whole enchilada for what were doing with our tech platform its just a necessary step to move a large part of our business into the cloud and weve got i think three different providers we just have had the largest contract went to microsoft on this occasion mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then a separate question on culture i think it was like six or seven years ago you made some pretty harsh comments on compensation and people had to take stock and they were all upset and i guess that was the right move for you and for them and recently you made some other tough comments as relates to employees needing to be back in the office and theres a big debate out there should you have a hybrid solution should people be back in the office if you work outside the office should you be paid less so i preface my question saying well you were right whenever that was six or seven years ago about taking a hard stance short term for the long term can you elaborate on those comments you made recently james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well theyre certainly not connected and i think it was nine years ago i think it was we were barely profitable and we cut the dividend to we had zero buyback and we had an roe of about and somebody asked me in tv interview how would i feel about people complaining about their bonuses and i said what i said at the time if you dont reward your shareholders at some point as you remind us over the years mike when our roe was well below they pick up their bat and ball and go home so given were paying employees a lot in stock it was in their selfinterest to hang tough get a lot of stock very cheap and theyd be rewarded and im very very happy for our employees that thats in fact whats transpired and the stock has gone from obviously a very low number to where we are today morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 the comment i made about the workplace i fundamentally believe that the way you and i and others sitting in this room sharon and jon have developed our careers is by being mentored by and watching and experiencing the professional skills of those who come before us its certainly dramatically affected my career and i dont think you can do that sitting at home by yourself i think theres a limit to how far as good as the zoom technology is how far that can take you so what i said was that i wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by labor day but i also said which wasnt picked up in the media that we would be flexible where flexibility was called for what weve learned through covid is that under certain circumstances having people work from home makes great sense there are individuals who have health issues there are individuals who are looking after family members in past years we would have said well thats sort of too bad now if you have to move to be with your family for a couple months to look after a health issue or a family issue we can manage that some people have extraordinary commutes we can manage some flexibility around that but the basic premise and right at the beginning of covid in february of what was it i think i said when i was asked how would this end up i think i said that i felt of all employee hours worked would be done in one of our offices and thats probably where its going to end up not but not operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i just had a question around i know you mentioned earlier in terms of updating the street around your plus return outlook early next year i was wondering if you can talk about as you think about the next five years and just the competitive forces talk to us how youre thinking about budgeting some investment spend as it relates to rd or more experimentaltype investments that could allow you to better compete and gain market share james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley that would take a lot longer than we probably have on this call why dont we hold that until we get to the strategy discussion next year because i much rather tie budgeting and investment discussions to actual initiatives were undertaking rather than just do it in the abstract here if you dont mind operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning sharon and james can you guys share with us you talked about wallet share gains in the isg group and i was wondering if you could elaborate on how you think youre achieving as some of your peers have said the same thing is it because of your people or the amount youve invested in technology your size or is it some of your competitors are just weaker and have other issues to deal with which gives you this opening to take wallet share gains morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley hi gerard its nice to hear from you id say its all of the above but more importantly i also think that there is something that weve said which is in periods of crisis which i think you saw over the course of oftentimes those that you are closest to from a relationship perspective end up being your closest relationship and youre gaining share in that regard so very similar to what weve talked a lot about on this call about asset consolidation in a wealth management relationship i think the same goes for the relationship consolidation if you think about institutional securities so be that on the equity underwriting for example be that in coming to the equity business but not forgetting what weve done in fixed income which has really gained share since to be a really credible player in that marketplace so all of those things i think technology and leveraging technology with the beginning of mset in equities moving over to the right places in fixed income where it makes sense that investment continues and i think its helped us gain share as well from like you said probably the europeans and others that have retreated in certain marketplaces operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeremy sigee with bnp paribas your line is now open jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thank you just really a quick followup on net interest income in wealth management i just wondered whether any of you were sort of at a sustainable base level here and nii should now grow in line with the volumes that are coming through or are there any further moving parts that you expect to affect that sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley well i would say that the fundamental moving part is rates right so if you think about it obviously there are certain things where when we look at giving you guidance or presenting a base case the base case is whats priced into the marketplace and so we use that as the guide and thats why i think for this quarter what we mentioned was the medium part of the curve did move more than i think most had expected or predicted but as you go forward right now at least for the build is really going to come from the actual lending which weve talked about which is a number is what weve just given you and we said that that ran around billion for that year so thats billion to billion a quarter that you can think of for the growth in lending per quarter through the end of the year operator thank you our last question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies your line is now open daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning so i had a couple of questions just on the investment management and eaton vance so curious i know you mentioned that youre just integrating the sales forces for the distribution platforms but curious about which products you think have the most potential to be sold through the morgan stanley distribution on the global side as you look at the eaton vance product lineup today and then within esg you have multiple capabilities now with calvert and what was legacy morgan stanley how do you think about integrating that more broadly across the investment management segment given the demand youre seeing were seeing across the industry for those types of products morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so i would say sort of similar to my last answer which is all of the above i think all products but particularly weve talked a lot about the customization of parametric i dont think thats just wealth management i think thats a workplace product as well over time so not just an advisorled product alternatives private credit is one where i think weve seen an interest and we continue to see interest in alternatives from the wealth management franchises more broadly not just our own and as you think about esg we had always talked about eaton vance and the old msim being a perfect fit in terms of the two and i think a lot of that came from the distribution and the complementary distribution that you had so esg products and calvert was an eaton vance product with a us domestic sales force we have a strong international sales force and obviously a lot of the interest in the esg and sustainability products are also coming from europe and abroad and so thats where we think that that distribution can really help thinking about taking those products elsewhere operator thank you there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank you for your participation you may
