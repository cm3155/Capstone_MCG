it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian and hello everyone welcome to our third quarter earnings call earlier today we reported third quarter revenues of billion up over last years third quarter and earnings per share of these strong results once again reflect accelerating momentum in our core business as billings on our network reached record highs for the third quarter driven by goods and services spending in my remarks this morning i want to put into context the decisions that we made prepandemic when the pandemic hit and during the pandemic to drive the growth we are now seeing and the increased confidence we now have in our business model in we introduced a new financial growth algorithm which called for highsingledigit revenue growth and doubledigit eps growth prior to the pandemic we achieved those objectives for straight quarters through focused and increased investment levels in our business we executed strategies for profitably growing the business which were based on initiatives to attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers in both our consumer and commercial businesses and while our differentiated business model gave us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities we saw we also knew that the favorable economic conditions we had at the time could change so we also developed a plan for winning through the downcycle that focused on protecting our customers and our colleagues and maintaining our capital strength while investing strategically and at the right time to rebuild momentum so we could win during a recovery american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 through it all the driving force behind everything we do from product innovations to our investment decisions is to continue to make the american express brand special and back our customers over the last several years we focused our strategies on broadening the appeal of core products to attract new customers particularly millennial and gen z customers as well as expanding our leadership position with sme customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses to accomplish those objectives we made a series of investments and ill highlight a few we put in place a strategy for consistently refreshing our core premium products adding value with expanded and relevant new benefits targeted at key consumer and small business customers and we charged for that added value we added a host of new digital capabilities for consumers and small businesses and expanded and enhanced our mobile app to appeal to the digital lifestyles of our target customers were an early mover in launching our buy now pay later capability pay it plan it which we introduced to address the evolving borrowing preferences of our customers we increased our focus on working with strategic partners to help us enrich our value propositions expand our network and broaden our digital capabilities and offerings for example we negotiated wideranging longterm agreements with key cobrand partners such as delta hilton and amazon we also expanded partnerships with digital giants such as paypal and added a new variety of partners to our ecosystem including fintechs such as billcom and better and lifestyle brands such as equinox we achieved virtual parity coverage in the us and we increased coverage internationally through a more targeted approach while increasing the number of compelling offers and benefits that our merchants deliver to our card members when the pandemic hit unexpectedly in early we responded by activating our plan for winning through the cycle using the same customerfocused approach to concentrate on retaining our customers and addressing their immediate needs we moved quickly to enhance and expand our financial relief programs to assist our customers who suddenly faced financial hardships our frontline servicing team stepped up to ensure we continue to provide the worldclass service our customers have come to expect from american express we pivoted the value proposition to several of our premium products adding temporary benefits on categories that were relevant to how customers spending behaviors have changed such as wireless streaming food delivery and others this has produced lasting behavioral changes as spending in a number of these categories including wireless and streaming has proven to be sustainable soon after we turned our attention to small businesses who needed help by launching the largest global small business campaign in the companys history creating the stand for small coalition and supporting minority owned small businesses in the united states as last year progressed we learned from our customers what resonated with them in this unprecedented environment and we grew more confident to seize the growth opportunities we saw emerging so we revved up our investments in card member acquisitions and value proposition innovations to capitalize on those opportunities and start rebuilding of our growth momentum we also saw an opportunity to accelerate our strategy to bring new digital beyondthecard capabilities to our small business customers and acquired kabbage one of the leading providers of digital cash management platforms importantly the increasing demand were seeing for our products and what we learned from the early value proposition enhancements encouraged us to restart our product refresh strategy last year and in july we launched our new consumer platinum card in the us were repeating this customerled product innovation strategy with the refresh of the us business platinum card which we launched last week as with the consumer card refresh the new benefits we added to our business platinum in key spend categories such as electronics software shipping wireless and others were informed by our card members desires american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 coming into we were emboldened by the strong results we were seeing toward the end of from our customer retention and acquisition efforts and we decided to doubledown our investments in marketing product innovations technology and people to accelerate our growth momentum all these decisions those that we made before the pandemic when the pandemic hit and through this year as conditions began to improve are driving the results were seeing today for example customer acquisitions have gained momentum over the last five quarters with million new cards in force in the third quarter demand for our premium feebased products has been particularly robust with acquisitions of our us consumer and small business platinum and gold cards reaching alltime highs in the quarter in consumer millennial and gen z customers have driven this growth with of new us gold and platinum consumer cards coming from these customers in commercial we had one of the best quarters ever for us small business card acquisitions our focus on meeting the needs of smes and millennial and gen z consumer customers has resulted in these groups being the most resilient throughout the pandemic leading to growth in spending in fact spending from these groups continued to accelerate in the third quarter with goods and services spending from smes growing above levels and overall spending for millennial and gen z customers particularly strong up over levels our initiatives to protect our customers at the beginning of the pandemic has driven retention and satisfaction metrics higher than prepandemic levels and the digital capabilities weve introduced have driven steady increases in digital engagement for example approximately of active card members are digitally engaged with us and we had the highestever daily active user engagement across the web and mobile in august with a nearly increase yearoveryear as these examples show the strategies we implemented to profitably grow our business before the pandemic began coupled with the decisions we made in executing our strategy to manage through the pandemic and to win during the recovery have generated strong consistent momentum as the environment continues to improve and what weve learned through this past year is informing our strategy for investing to profitably grow our business moving forward looking ahead were operating from a position of strength and we see even more opportunities to build on the momentum weve created so we will continue to invest strategically in seeking to drive even higher levels of sustainable longterm revenue and eps growth with that ill turn it over to jeff to discuss our third quarter results in detail and then well take your questions thank you jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thanks steve and good morning everyone its good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results which reflect strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that steve just spoke about you see this momentum in our summary financials on slide with third quarter revenues of billion up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis third quarter net income of billion and earnings per share of to get right into a more detailed look at our results lets talk about how the strategies that steve just discussed have helped to drive our volumes back above prepandemic levels as you can see on slide you will notice in the several views of volumes that begin on slide that we continue to show third quarter volume trends on both a yearoveryear basis and relative to as we find this provides a clearer picture of the progress we are making in building growth momentum we did see continued momentum in spending volumes in the third quarter with total network volumes and billed business volumes both up around yearoveryear and up relative to on an fxadjusted basis american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 this growth in billed business is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services which you can see on slide represents of our overall billed business and was up versus and strengthened sequentially versus q2 we are very pleased with this continued strength in goods and services spending given the investments weve made in premium card member engagement prospect acquisition growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners focusing in first on our consumer business on slide overall spending was above levels as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to above in the third quarter for many years weve been focused on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities aided by these efforts you see that millennials and gen z customers are leading the growth in spending reaching above levels for the quarter while our older age cohorts have shown continued steady though smaller improvement as well turning to our commercial business as you know weve been very focused on helping our small and medium size enterprise clients run their business by expanding the range of products and capabilities to meet their b2b payments and working capital needs this strategic focus on smes has been key in driving the performance you see on slide global sme spending which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spending up versus driven by strong growth in b2b spending on goods and services which grew above levels in q3 in contrast large and global corporate card spending which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment continue to show fewer signs of recovery weve said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover digging into goods and services spending trends on slide we continue to see strong growth in online and card notpresent spending which was up versus even as offline spending fully recovered in the third quarter demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes weve seen during the pandemic we also saw growth across all categories of goods and services spending with both consumer and smes driving the strong growth in retail and wholesale spending and smes leading the growth in advertising and media spending turning now to te spending on slide you continue to see a recovery that is on track with our expectation that well reach of levels in the fourth quarter te spending improved sequentially versus q2 and were pleased to see restaurant spending our most resilient and now largest te category back above prepandemic levels in the quarter we did see some modest impacts from the delta variant in the airline category where the pace of recovery slowed a bit in august but it has strengthened again in september and into early october the trends we have seen reinforce our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover but at varying paces across customer types and geographies and we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel turning to our last look at volumes on slide you do see that the overall billed business volume recovery continues to be led by the us which first surpassed levels in q2 and was up in the third quarter importantly though growth in goods and services spending has been strong both in the us and outside of the us overall spending is only weaker outside the us because historically we have more travelrelated spending in our international regions and international te is recovering more slowly than in the us given crossborder travel restrictions looking ahead based on current trends we still assume that overall te spending globally will recover to around of levels in the fourth quarter of and even more importantly we expect continued strong growth momentum in goods and services spending so all in all a really good story on spending volumes american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 moving on then to receivable and loan balances on slide loan balances continued to slowly recover in the third quarter and were up yearoveryear and sequentially relative to though loan balances remained down as we continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates which is also driving the very strong credit performance ill talk about in a moment i would point out that we have hit an inflection point on revolving loan balances and though it will take time for those balances to rebuild as paydown rates are likely to remain elevated in the nearterm we believe over the long term we can get back to growing our loan volumes faster than the industry for the next few quarters though i continue to expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery in spending volumes turning next to credit and provision on slides through as you flip through these slides there are a few key points id like you to take away most importantly we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows as loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time however given how low delinquency rates are today we dont expect to see a material increase in writeoff rates in the next few quarters this strong credit performance combined with further improvement in the macroeconomic outlook drove a million provision expense benefit in the third quarter as the low writeoffs were fully offset by the reserve release as shown on slide that said we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off and that there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment in addition we are closely monitoring how the card members exiting our financial relief programs are performing though the early performance of the card members that have exited these programs has looked quite strong as you see on slide we ended the third quarter with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively which is only slightly below the reserve levels we had prepandemic so given that our credit metrics are still around historical lows i would say that we continue to hold an appropriately significant amount of reserves driven by the remaining uncertainties i just spoke about moving next to revenues on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the third quarter we had doubledigit growth in all of our noninterest revenue lines and we are starting to see growth in net interest income as well before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply yearoveryear in the third quarter primarily driven by the uptick in travelrelated revenues were beginning to see though they still remain well below levels turning to our largest revenue line discount revenue on slide you see it grew yearoveryear on an fx adjusted basis and is now comfortably above levels this growth was primarily driven by the steady momentum in goods and services spending that weve seen over the past few quarters net card fee revenues continued to grow as consistently as they have throughout the entire pandemic up yearoveryear in the third quarter these card fee revenues are now higher than they were back in the third quarter of as you can see on slide the resiliency of these subscriptionlike revenues demonstrates the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers turning to net interest income on slide you can see that it was up yearoveryear though still growing slower relative to the other revenue lines we have clearly hit an inflection point this growth was slower than the american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 growth in lending ar due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances we did see a modest sequential improvement in revolving loan balances in the third quarter but looking ahead i continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes so to sum up on revenues the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in q3 as you can see on slide with revenue up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis looking forward with the strength in goods and services spend growth weve seen in the first three quarters of the year we now assume that full year revenue growth could be around if current trends continue the revenue momentum weve seen this year has clearly been accelerated as a result of the investments weve been making in marketing value propositions technology and people and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide let me start at the bottom with operating expenses which were up year overyear in the third quarter looking forward i still expect our fullyear opex to be below the billion we originally expected as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing in technology and our people to drive longterm growth in our business moving on to variable customer engagement expenses at the top of slide there are a few things to think about most importantly in we added some incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travelrelated aspects of our value propositions the cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing investment line and are now winding down we are able to wind them down because our customers are again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions which is a good thing in terms of longerterm customer retention and growth prospects it does however mean you see more yearoveryear growth in these variable customer engagement costs as one example of the financial implications of customers again engaging in travelrelated aspects of our membership rewards program in the rewards line we made a roughly million adjustment this quarter to our membership rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travelrelated categories looking forward as ive said in the past few quarters i expect these variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around of total revenues turning next to the marketing investments were making to build growth momentum you can see on slide that we invested billion in marketing in the third quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisition while winding down our value injection efforts we acquired million new cards up yearoveryear and sequentially in the third quarter much more importantly though than just the total number of cards we focused internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from new acquisitions and revenues from this quarters acquisitions are trending stronger than what we saw prepandemic one key driver of this performance is the great demand for our premium feebased products with new accounts acquired on these products more than doubling yearoveryear and representing of the new accounts acquired in the quarter in particular acquisitions of new us consumer and small business platinum and gold card members were at alltime highs this quarter and this was again one of the best quarters for small business new account acquisitions in the us based on the opportunities weve seen in the first three quarters of we now expect to invest over billion in marketing for the year we feel really good about the results weve seen from our strategic investments and see an opportunity to continue to invest during the recovery to maximize sustainable longterm growth american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 turning next to capital on slide our cet1 ratio was at the end of the third quarter which declined from the prior quarter but remained above our target ratio of to in the quarter we returned billion of capital to our shareholders including common stock purchases of billion and million in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation looking forward we expect our cet1 ratio to migrate to our target range over the next few quarters as we continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we hold and generate while supporting balance sheet growth so lets close by talking about what the signs and momentum we saw in the first three quarters of this year might mean for the future as a reminder we started the year with a wide range of scenarios of potential outcomes for as we did not know how the medical and economic environment would evolve during the year and the impact it would have most importantly on our credit reserves now three quarters into the year the macro outlook has steadily improved and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong weve already released billion of reserves accounting for over of eps yeartodate that still leaves us however with a lot of reserves due to the remaining uncertainties i spoke about earlier so our updated scenario on slide assumes that this uncertainty persists that the medical environment and economic outlook does not improve further and that we therefore dont release any additional credit reserves this year that could lead to an eps outcome as low as around per share our updated scenario in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance as the remaining stimulus and forbearance programs roll off and that we also see continued improvement in the economic outlook leading to less uncertainty and in all likelihood a lower level of credit reserves in this scenario our eps could be as high as around in closing we feel really good about the progress weve made this year as a result of our investments in marketing value propositions technology and our people and as the year has gone on weve gotten even more confident in our ability to deploy significant resources towards building sustainable longterm growth momentum based on all these current trends we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of eps expectations we originally had for in and to continue to drive towards higher levels of sustainable growth over the longterm and with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions brad american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning steve good morning jeff jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so as we look ahead to next year jeff you said that you expect to be on the high end of your original which is what you had mentioned last quarter if we look back to that timeframe you were expecting mid to high losses mid to high losses provisions were going to be in the billion to billion range versus where i look now losses are running sub1 and you noted you dont expect them to move up that much for the next few quarters so can you maybe just one jeff talk about some of the puts and takes such that you wouldnt be above the high end given how much leverage you have from credit and then second steve maybe you could expand on the comment that jeff made to continue to invest to maximize the longterm growth that can help you sustain the financial algorithm that you laid out at the beginning of the call thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co so let me start ryan by pointing out in my remarks weve already this year because of the environment added over of eps to our earnings just from releasing credit reserves so as you think about my comments about we assume next year well have strong credit results but youre going to go from having a several billion dollar good guy on the provision side this year to having more of a normalized for the new world of lower credit losses provision expense next year so we see that as a pretty impressive growover to in fact be confident in getting to the high end of where we originally thought wed be in next year considering the magnitude of that growover considering that its not reliant on a full recovery across all of our businesses we actually see tailwinds that probably will help us in and into and thats why as i turn it over to steve i think we are so emboldened by the progress weve seen bringing new people into the franchise ryan that we think we have an opportunity here to continue to invest significant resources to drive longerterm even higher levels of sustainable growth stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co look if you wouldve asked me at the beginning of the year would we invest almost billion in marketing this year i wouldve said no but were not governed by what level we think we should or what anybody thinks we should hit were governed by the fact that there are tremendous opportunities out there and when you look at what is going on sort of with our acquisition activities right now look we brought in million cardholders and what we really focus on is what revenue those cardholders really bring in and what were seeing is were seeing a american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 cardholder base that is spending more than were bringing in that has a better fico profile and its skewing millennial and its skewing feepaying and so as we run our models well be governed by can we continue to acquire these card members and we are and the reality is that and i said this from day one were running this for the medium to longterm and the reality is if we continue to find those great opportunities in the consumer base in the sme base in some opportunities beyond the card that we might have well continue to invest so as we look at it right now our plan is to continue to be aggressive with our investments constrained by our investment return models not constrained by a certain level that people think we should or should not be at and thats just the way weve been running the business for the last few years and well continue to do that and i think its really served us well during the pandemic i dont think you wouldve thought that this year we wouldve spent that kind of money but i think the key point is were spending that money to grow the business profitably were not spending that money because were in some battle to keep up with the joneses here okay operator and our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hi betsy stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions here first just followingup on that on the marketing side it seems like that is in line with what youve been spending historically as a percentage of revenues so should we take your comments to mean that you would ramp that up from here or that theres a trajectory of marketing expense spend thats going to be similar to what youve had in the past as a percentage of revs jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well i think betsy what you should take is that were not governed by thinking about okay we got to keep the percent of revenue that marketing represents constant or similar to where it was in were governed by the universe of really attractive opportunities we see to build longerterm growth momentum so thats what has driven our marketing spend now including value injection to over billion this year much higher than steve and i started the year thinking it would be and as we think about were very confident in the kind of eps outcome that weve been talking about but the ultimate amount of marketing that goes with that is going to be a function of the attractive opportunities and because were getting such great growth from the spending as steve talked about were actually generating more revenue from the dollars that were investing in marketing than we were american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 prepandemic the marketing starts to become a little selffunding while still hitting our eps targets if the opportunities are there so thats whats going to drive us in terms of how much marketing we do next year and was there a part two betsy if the operator keeps you on operator my apologies our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi and good morning thank you for taking my question not surprisingly i also have a question on marketing and engagement spending so in terms of maybe just talking about it at a little bit of a higher level like in terms of competition i understand that american express has always been in a very competitive market for many years maybe talk about the dimensions of the competition have they changed postcompetition are you seeing different players and also just in terms of your marketing and customer acquisition spending how is it different today than it was maybe prepandemic like in is there are you making investments in different things are customers asking for different things stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so look the only time id say competition sort of ramped down was during the pandemic when nobody was really acquiring a lot of cards but when we look at the range of competitors you have to realize that were looking at competitors on a global basis countrybycountry were looking at competitors across corporate card small business and consumer cards and i think as we talk to quite honestly as we talk to you guys about competition where the drive tends to be is consumer competition in the us and the reality is that this has been a competitive market since the financial crisis i mean i think the consumer card competition really heated up after the financial crisis when the big money center banks decided to really get serious about their consumer card business and a lot of them have done a really good job and we compete very vigorously with them and so i dont really think in my mind i dont think its changed all that much i think it paused a little bit during the pandemic but i dont think its changed at all the other thing that i would say is there are a range of other competitors out there fintechs and what have you and we continue to watch them whether its competitors in the corporate card space competitors in other places from a buy now pay later perspective thats not really a big competitive threat to us i mean when you think about buy now pay later it tends to be targeted at low fico it tends to be targeted at a lot of debit card users its used as a customer acquisition vehicle and thats just not the game that were playing weve had a buy now pay later product since and its just another way for our card members to manage their spending within the overall american express relationship its a transactionbytransaction management tool which quite honestly is a lot more flexible than pointofsale buy now pay later because you dont know whos going to actually have point of sale at every merchant you go to and then for the pay in four people which is also another thing thats out there which is a version of buy now pay later actually our charge card product gives you more float and gives you rewards but you have to look at all this stuff whether its whoever is coming into the space so we look at competitors all the time and you have to evaluate how it attacks your customer base but i think the way we run this business and youve seen this over decades is we continually put more value and build a bigger moat around our customers and just look at what weve done with the platinum card here we refreshed this product while it was american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 going gang busters both of them we were at record levels of platinum acquisition before the refresh and yet we went out and refreshed and went out and raised the fee and how can you do that because youre adding more value both on the consumer side and both on the small business side and so look in the third quarter we have record levels of not only platinum but gold card acquisition for our base so we feel really good about that i think as far as how you spend your money look obviously the industry has changed you do a lot less direct mail than you used to do theres a lot more sort of aggregator acquisition but i think whats really important about us and as we look at our marketing spend we look at our marketing spend not only for prospect marketing but we invest in our customers and we spend marketing money on our customers to continue to grow their spend to upgrade their product to introduce them to our lending capabilities and it creates a flywheel right because what you do is you bring these prospects in and then you manage these prospects and get them to become more and more profitable and one of the things that we hang our hat on is we look at our customers as a platform for growth and if you can continue to do more and more with your customers they will generate more revenue youll have more loyalty and youre seeing that youre seeing that in our retention metrics and so we really look at our marketing spend its not just acquisition its also with our existing customer base and thats probably changed a little bit more over the years as weve invested more and more in our customers as the product set that we have continues to expand jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and steve one of the best examples of that last evolution you talked about is the fact that our memberget member program where our existing card members who are so attached to the brand that they get other card members and friends to also get attached to the brand that has come from almost nowhere a few years ago to being one of our most significant acquisition channels and i think its a real commentary on everything you just talked about operator and we do have those followup questions from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co sorry about that betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc no problem thanks yeah you mentioned during the prepared remarks that this was one of the best quarters for acquiring small business and i wanted to tie that into an article that was out recently saying that youre going to be working with goldman sachs to enable b2b for your clients this is really in the corporate card the top companies globally that you work with and in this article it suggested that you would not be offering transaction account directly from yourself but youre tyingin with a partner to enable that maybe you could give us some color as to how this offering is expected to drive business opportunities talk about the transaction account banking piece of that and then if you could tie it into what youre seeing in smb and what you could be offering to smb clients too that would be helpful thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 so its good to clarify this so look were very excited about the partnership with goldman and look we have relationships with of the fortune companies and when we compete as we compete sometimes we compete with other money center banks that have corporate card programs and also have transaction banking and they tend to integrate that and so goldman is very interested in getting into transaction banking not as necessarily as interested in getting into the corporate card we do a number of things with goldman sachs from a customer perspective theyre a customer of ours were a customer of theirs and as john and david and i were talking about things it looked like a really good opportunity they were trying to ramp up their transaction banking we have the corporate card and putting those things together in that space a space that we really werent going to get into transaction banking as it related to large banks its just not our space okay corporate card is but not transaction banking so we decided to look at the top and if that goes well and theres no reason why it will not go well then we can put it a little bit more downstream to say the sp we have a different perspective as it relates to the smb space which is why if you remember what weve talked about from an smb perspective is we wanted to be the working capital providers for our small businesses and now in the small business space we have a very good footprint not only in the united states but good footprints internationally we also remember during the pandemic we bought kabbage and what is kabbage kabbage is basically a transaction banking platform right and so what kabbage has kabbage does shortterm loans it does working capital loans merchant financing loans it has a transaction banking account it has a debit card attached to it and we have our american express card attached to that so we have a very different philosophy as it relates to small businesses where the commitment of capital the commitment of cash that we have to put out and the commitment from a loan perspective will be much smaller and be much more diffused across the entire sme base and so we believe its a sweet spot for us and that was the kabbage piece of it we did not believe that transaction banking was a sweet spot for us from an sp and above and were really thrilled to be partnering with goldman on this betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of bob napoli with william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning i guess i wanted to followup steve and jeff on the smb business and the competitive environment in that space and your movements in adding additional products and services there is a lot more competition i guess from venturebacked companies like brex and divvy and ramp where you have divvy now part of your partner billcom but how do you see those companies are growing very fast and theyre providing i think spend management or business spend management services how do you view that competition relative to your smb efforts and are there additional products and services and ecosystem youre building for your smb clients stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well look i mean from an sme perspective had a pretty good quarter up so we feel pretty good about that and i think ill just point you back to what i just responded to betsy with obviously we went out and bought kabbage and kabbage has look it has cash flow analysis on it it has transaction banking it has debit it has the ability to loan so now what you do is you take a fintech platform like kabbage you take american express american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 with over million small business customers and a sizable balance sheet and a sizable brand and a lot of capabilities you put that together we believe it gives us a really great offering as it relates to our smb base and look im not going to discount any of those ramp or brex or divvy or any we never discount anybody and you look to learn from people as well but we believe that the combination of what we have and the space that were in and putting together kabbage and then also integrating into kabbage acompay and our ap capabilities our ap automation capabilities puts us in a very very good position to continue to compete in this space and continue to grow and continue to win operator and our next question comes from the line of arren cyganovich with citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks maybe we could touch on capital distribution a little bit the buybacks for the quarter were well above i think more than double what the street was expecting is that kind of level just more of a catchup or do you expect to have kind of an elevated level of capital return for the next couple of quarters jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well you are correct arren it was quite elevated probably our largestever quarter of share repurchase and its really strictly a catchup right this is our first quarter where we were completely free of any fed constraints on our buyback weve been very clear for many years that our target cet1 capital ratio is to as you all know that is actually well above the regulatory minimum its really more governed by our own view of the balance sheet and the rating agency view of the balance sheet so since the constraints from the fed were lifted while we dont want to disrupt the market we did buy more aggressively i think you will continue to see us buy above what i will call a steadystate level and our steadystate level is pretty high as a company with a roe we generate a lot more capital than we need each year but itll stay elevated until you get back down into that to range which id expect to happen over the next couple of quarters operator and we do have a question from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions this morning look i think when we look back at whats happened over the last year we really see the strength of the american express franchise on the core business and in a lot of ways things have stayed the same im curious when you look forward what do you think is different about the business as we emerge from the covid crisis is it the demographic of your customer is it the expansion with kabbage whats going to be different in the next three years because of what weve seen in last year stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think that if you look at sort of whats happened here i think weve vetted down customers a lot more than weve ever vetted them down in the past and that was because were really focused on a lot of this value proposition enhancement and one of the reasons that i started my remarks today with sort of prepandemic at pandemic and during the pandemic was to show that this was a bit of a continuum here right when you think about this what we talked about a number of years ago was really focusing in on our customers focusing in on refreshing our products and services becoming more digitally engaged and expanding that organic core of american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 products and services and what i think what we saw during the pandemic here was that we saw an accelerant as it related to online our online spending has accelerated tremendously i think were up in q3 here goods and services growth over and so weve been able to direct our card members in ways faster than we probably would have gotten there without the pandemic and again i think looking at our overall strategy of refreshing these card products has led us to expanding our overall base as we expand the value propositions look were talking about over millennial and gen z acquisition in a platinum card where we just raised the fee to so its obviously speaking to that base and i think thats one of the things weve seen over this time period is how much more we are speaking to that customer segment and so when you put that all together and you add the sme piece of it which is a complete expansion with kabbage is that were opening up a lot more doors for us to do business with our sme customers and one of the things weve learned is that the more products that you have with your customer the higher retention rates that you have obviously the more revenue that you have and the more engagement that you have and so i think weve probably driven faster to where we thought we were going to get ultimately as a result of the pandemic but we havent fundamentally changed where we were going and thats why i wanted to start this conversation this morning with this is a continuum for us but again like weve talked about in the environment online has been accelerated probably three years from a macroeconomic perspective and i think were seeing our strategy that we were looking to continually implement that has been accelerated and its proven to be right jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co the one financial piece rick and steve id add to that that is very similar is that our funding structure has actually changed quite significantly over the course of the pandemic to be more heavily weighted to our depository products which are our lowest cost of funding and when i project ahead through years that trend is going to continue so that is actually i think perhaps a little noticed but very positive change for us as well when you look a little longerterm stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah one other point that ill just make and not to beat on this but when you look at the fact that weve when you look at our acquisition and you see where we are acquiring these card members it has actually expanded our playing field and so with that playing field expanded thats why youre seeing this broader marketing spend because you have more customers to go after you have more archetypes now that you can go after than you did probably three or four years ago because the product is speaking to a broader set of consumers out there now broader in terms of demographic and broader in terms of age and so forth and wants and needs the products are all getting broader and a product can now appeal to multiple customer sets and youre seeing differentiation between the products its just not an upgrade when you look at the gold versus the platinum there is specific differences here that speak to a different consumer or a different small business customer so i think that has probably changed as well operator and we do have a question from the line of dominick gabriele with oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele q executive director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thank you so much for taking my questions i was just curious on the million sme customers as you look at the total us sme spend does that volume growth typically track the total market given how penetrated american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 you are there with your relationships and i guess would that include any cash conversion i know it represents inventories is most of that done on card anyway thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah look i dont have sort of market share information on that but sort of at the tip of my fingers here but it is we think from a growth perspective we are probably growing at or above market at this particular point in time but when we look at this what is down from an sme perspective is te so you are seeing a conversion of check or cash or wire to card and i think we saw that during the pandemic and i think thats where some of the investment in sort of our ap automation has helped as well and when you talk about b2b spending approximately of sme spending is b2b spending maybe of sme spending is b2b spending and they use it for lots of different things theres some inventory management but remember our sme base is so broad and its professional services lawyers hvac so forth and so on and so they do use look they do use the product for goods for resale as well i mean auto glass companies use it to buy auto glass and plumbers use it to buy supplies and so forth and so on and youre probably seeing a little bit more cash conversion but were pretty pleased with that number of growth plus with the te component of that being down operator and we do have a question from the line of lisa ellis with moffettnathanson please go ahead lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hey good morning thanks for squeezing me in i had another like a followup question on the growth that youre seeing in the millennials and gen zs that you called out on slide can you just take a step back and comment a bit on what features and rewards specifically or like which card profiles that youre seeing are particularly attracting those consumers like how have you been this successful over the last couple of years and then also can you give us any sense of the percentage of your us card base or some measure along those lines thats currently in those younger cohorts thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so the last part we dont really we havent i dont know if weve disclosed the last point but let me go with the first point while they feverishly look for that answer lisa as theyre sitting around the table with me but as far as the first part look millennials and gen zs are about experiences and theyre about access and i can speak from experience having a house full of them and so they love to travel they love to do things and when you look at the platinum card product which had always been positioned as hey im a real high spender i need to have that platinum card product you have to look at the utility of this product and you look at fine hotels and resorts and you look at the value that you get out of a fine hotel and resort booking with an early checkin and a late checkout or a free breakfast and credit at the hotel and then you look at streaming credits theyre online shoppers theres rewards accelerators theres travel credits theres access to tickets theres access to special card member events it is a range of services that they use and look equinox is another benefit that we put on and look we just added walmart membership which a majority of our platinum cardholders shop at walmart and we think this is a great benefit as well so when they look at this product it really is a lifestyle product for them one that ranges from their everyday activities of online spending and streaming all the way to traveling and the credits they get whether its global entry in tsa pre and all those kinds of things so it is a wideranging valuerich product for these younger people and older people like myself but basically out of this particular cohort its of our american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 overall spending and in the third quarter that grew so we feel pretty good about that as we move so i think that gives you the answer to your second question operator and we do have a question from the line of meng jiao with deutsche bank please go ahead meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask about potential ma are there sort of any areas in your product set that might benefit from possibly bolton acquisitions and then has there been more opportunities to engage in the fintech space or have high valuations continue to be a headwind to any sort of activity there thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i mean look lets take a little historical walk down memory lane but we have we bought resy which was a great bolton acquisition for us with dining and it becomes a great system for new card members because we dont just limit resy to our cardholders and then we added loungebuddy which is a lounge finder which provides our card members not only with access to our centurion lounges but other relationships that we have over lounges and will also give them perspective on if our lounges are full or not then we bought mezi and we bought cake and a few others and then obviously kabbage so look were constantly looking and acompay we bought as well so were constantly looking for those bolton acquisitions things that will continue to drive our overall organic core and make our overall product set better some of the things are obviously the prices for fintech are obviously some of these things are very highly valued and obviously the math doesnt work but the way weve looked at it is if something makes strategic sense overall then well look at doing it but i think the big thing for us is we have a feeder system with amex ventures where we have probably investments in 40plus different entities right now and it gives us an opportunity to test drive them it gives us an opportunity to learn and through some of these investments it led to us acquiring companies down the road so look you never say never about anything and thats probably as far as im going to go but were always interested in things that are going to be accretive to the company overall operator and we do have a question from the line of mark devries with barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks steve i wanted to ask you about how youre thinking about crypto as you attract more of these millennials and gen zs who are digitally native how important is this to think about offering either the ability to pay or integrating it into your rewards prop and then also on a related matter how are you thinking about whether theres a role to play developing kind of a supplemental settlement layer to address interoperability issues and then finally when should we expect you to buy a cryptopunk stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so look we think about a broad range of digital currencies from crypto to stablecoins to governmentbacked digital currencies and look we think about cryptocurrency much more as an asset class at this particular point in time we dont use our card to sort of buy stock people dont use our card to buy stock and i dont think people american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 are going to use our card any time soon to buy crypto so i dont see that as a big role having said that within closed ecosystems of nfts and stablecoins and things like that you see it i mean were on nba top shot you can use the card there and theres a few other places where you can use the card and well see how that all plays out i think there are opportunities down the road potentially membership rewards and things like that as redemption options but i dont see at this point i dont foresee it at any point where cryptocurrency is going to be a threat to traditional credit card payments and theres a lot of reasons for that obviously theres rewards theres service there is the ability to dispute and theres also the ability to extend credit so theres always a role i think because i get asked this question is it going to displace traditional credit cards and i think the answer to that is no i think there is a role though for digital currencies i think it can make crossborder payments a lot more seamless and a lot easier to conduct and so well see how government digital currencies and other stablecoins play out operator and we do have a question from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks can we look at the yearoveryear improvement in goods and services i guess is there a way to parse apart how much of that is sort of your samecustomer growth versus new customer growth versus inflation im just trying to think about how that cycles through when travel and entertainment comes back i have one followup after that thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co all right well we dont think theres a hell of a lot of inflation at this particular point in time as far as new customer were in a lot of new customers we acquired last year and so samecustomer sales are driving quite a bit but we dont i dont have that at my fingertips at this point but i think what i would say is that when we see what weve seen from a value proposition injection perspective last year we saw a lot of that stuff stick so we saw more card members putting wireless on we saw more card members putting streaming services on and that has continued to flow through weve seen more of our card members putting online spending on so i think that our belief is thats going to stick and when you look at sort of goods and services growth its over its over so it has been consistent so i think thats here to stay and i think whatll happen is well get that travel the other thing i would say is we talked about the millennial cohort before and that being up our boomers are not back and so the majority of our traditional card base is not back yet and that is not growing at but the reality is they will come back and they will come back as they feel more safe and so we think thats a tailwind for us going forward sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats very helpful and then i guess jeff is there a way to be more specific on the provision next year i know its going to be dependent on loan growth and the macro but as youre thinking about whats embedded in your expectations for the high end of the range i mean is it close to several billions of dollars maybe you can just talk through that please jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 well i think sanjay the way to think about it is like many financial institutions we are still holding an appropriately but significant level of reserves driven by the uncertainty in the medical and economic environment at some point that level of uncertainty is going to decrease down to zero and at some point those reserves being held for that have to also go pretty much down to zero now so thats going to happen probably mostly over the course of next year on the other hand as loan growth begins to pick back up which it has in the last quarter as delinquencies start to drift up i dont think theyre going to spike up but theyll drift up a little bit then the actual what im going to call bau part of your provision is going to start to drift up whats really hard to predict though sanjay is the relative pace of those two things next year what i feel very confident though in pointing out as i did a few minutes ago is that relative to this year where you had billions of dollars that have led you to a net benefit on the provision line i certainly dont expect that next year which is why we feel pretty good about the confidence in the range weve given given that it actually represents several billions of dollars of improved business performance from a preprovision perspective but those are the dynamics that we think about sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning so ill close it out with a question on regulation jeff a lot of things have been going well for the company just want to checkin specifically on the us side and just see if youre feeling comfortable as you can with the environment stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah don ill answer it i think were as comfortable as we could be at this particular point in time for everything that we know but youre always worried about everything and regulation is one of those things but i think right now i think were okay and when we think about regulation we specifically think about things that have happened in europe and things that happened in australia and so forth and we really dont see that happening in the us well see what happens as it relates to the cfpb and how that all plays out but i think weve lived in this environment a long time we know how to operate in this environment and i think well just be fine but i dont see any sort of curveballs if you will coming down the pike at this point so thats what i have to say about it donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co with that we will bring the call to an end thank you again for joining todays
