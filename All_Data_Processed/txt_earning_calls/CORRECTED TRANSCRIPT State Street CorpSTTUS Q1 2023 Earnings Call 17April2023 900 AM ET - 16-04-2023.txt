ilene and good morning everyone earlier today weve released our first quarter financial results before i review our financial highlights i would like to briefly reflect on the eventful operating environment in the first quarter investors had to contend with significant market movements and volatility driven by persistent inflation continued central bank interest rate increases and the recent disruption to certain segments of the banking industry first quarter global financial market performance was choppy january produced a very strong start to the year with gains across most asset classes including equities recording the strongest start to a year since however investors remain cautious about the prospect of enduring inflation and a potential recession in the united states february saw that encouraging start receive as strong us employment data led to growing concerns about the persistence of inflation which in turn saw market expectations for central bank rate hikes increase fixed income and equity markets declined and the us dollar strengthened state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 march saw continued rising central bank rates which in turn drove shocks to both the us regional and international banking sectors and the need to resolve a number of banks all this drove negative market sentiment contributing to large inflows into money market funds and a reversal of a number of the macro trends from the prior month both current interest rates and rate expectations decreased and the us dollar weakened although relative ph comm returned to markets by the end of the quarter notwithstanding these events all told global financial markets performed relatively well in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year with broadbased gains recorded across global equities while us treasuries experienced their best quarter since the first quarter of however daily average equity and bond market levels both remained significantly below the year ago period with average equity markets down approximately which created headwinds for our feedriven businesses impacting our yearoveryear financial results which i will discuss shortly before i discuss our financial highlights i would like to briefly comment on the recent events and parts of the banking sector as the globally systemically important financial institution state street plays a critical role in the worlds financial system our strong capital and liquidity positions size scale and sophisticated risk management allow us to help safeguard investors and assist in providing market stability during uncertain times we demonstrated this ability at the start of covid three years ago when we helped establish the money market mutual fund liquidity facility and the main street lending program during the first quarter in concert with other large us banks state street once again used its financial strength to help assist in stabilizing the financial system through the provision of liquidity to a financial institution in the us reflecting our confidence in the american banking system we stand ready to support the worlds investors and the people they serve during this time of uncertainty for our investment servicing and asset management products which offer clients opportunities insights and liquidity turning to slide three of our investor presentation i will review our first quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail relative to the year ago period first quarter eps was million down as the positive yearoveryear benefit resulting from our continued common share repurchases as well as significantly stronger nii growth were offset by lower servicing and management fee revenues which were impacted by weaker average market levels continued business and personal investments to support growth and a loan loss provision related to state streets support of the us banking system which i just mentioned turning to our business momentum we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients front middle and back office activities for example in march we announced our agreement to acquire cf global trading this transaction will further expand state streets current outsourced trading capabilities giving our firm the ability to provide these services to new clients and markets importantly the acquisition will allow state street to expand its liquidityproviding capabilities and offer a complete global trading solution as part of our alpha fronttoback platform the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of subject to customary closing conditions state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 auca amounted to trillion at quarter end and we recorded asset servicing wins of billion in the first quarter about half of which were higher fee rate alternative mandates consistent with our strategy encouragingly this was our second best quarterly sales performance by projected revenue within the alternative segments over the last six years we also reported an additional alpha mandate during the first quarter as this strategy continues to resonate with clients our auca installation backlog amounted to trillion at quarter end at state street global advisors quarterend assets under management totaled trillion while flows across our asset management businesses were negatively impacted by the various market factors in the first quarter we continue to see a number of bright spots where we are focusing our efforts for example in the us our spdr etf franchise gained market share in both lowcost equity and lowcost fixed income while we also had strong inflows into our gold etfs amidst investor demand for safe haven assets while aggregate flows to cash were slightly negative for the quarter this largely resulted from seasonal outflow activity in january however global advisors gathered strong money market inflows of over billion in the latter part of march amidst the market volatility turning to our financial condition state streets balance sheet liquidity and capital positions remain strong our cet1 ratio was a high at quarter end well above state streets regulatory minimum this balance sheet strength enabled us to continue to return capital to our shareholders in the first quarter while simultaneously supporting our clients and the us banking system we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in q1 including buying back billion of our common shares and declaring over million of common stock dividends as we look ahead in this uncertain environment we remain highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet position while continuing to generate and return capital as part of our previously announced common stock repurchase program of up to billion for subject to market conditions and other factors to conclude the first quarter included a number of significant events in global financial markets and with the broader banking industry while market conditions were volatile many asset classes saw sequential quarter gains although asset prices remained depressed relative to the yearago period which created yearoveryear headwinds for our feedriven businesses in the first quarter while our yearoveryear revenue performance was durable supported by significantly higher net interest income growth our results this quarter were below our expectations we need to do better and i believe we are equipped and on track to do so by focusing on areas within our control and effectively executing our strategy in keeping with the strategic priorities i outlined in january we are driving forward with a number of actions for example our auca to be installed is strong and by strengthening our implementation capabilities we have line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding beginning in within our software and data business we expect to convert a meaningful number of crd onpremises clients to more recurring saas revenue in the second quarter last given the revenue and inflationary environments we will continue to selectively reprice some services proactively manage our cost execute on our productivity efforts and stand ready to utilize additional expense levers at our disposal with the focus on accountability and execution of our strategy i continue to firmly believe in the ability of our diversified franchise to successfully meet the needs of the worlds investors and the people they serve while delivering value for and capital return to our shareholders state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 now let me hand the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone ill begin my review of our first quarter results on slide we reported earnings per share of for the quarter which included a million provision or of eps impact associated with the extension of liquidity to a us financial institution as we participated in an industry consortium supporting the banking system we were pleased to do our part on the left panel of this slide you can see that our first quarter results reflected the yearonyear decline in both equity and fixed income markets but was more than offset by strength in net interest income and strong momentum in our securities finance business eps was down just as another quarter of significant buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding against this challenging backdrop we again held total expense growth to just yearonyear even as we continue to thoughtfully invest in product and client growth initiatives turning now to slide during the quarter we saw periodend auca decrease by on a yearonyear basis but increased sequentially yearonyear the decrease of auca was largely driven by lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally which were both down in the range quarteronquarter auca increased as a result of higher period end market levels and client flows at global advisors we saw similar dynamics play out overall our first quarter aum was negatively impacted by volatile markets period end aum decreased yearonyear but increased sequentially the yearonyear decline in aum was largely driven by lower period end market levels and net outflows quarteronquarter the increase in aum was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels partially offset by some outflows turning to slide on the left side of the page youll see first quarter total servicing fees down yearonyear largely driven by lower average market levels client activity and adjustments and normal pricing headwinds partially offset by net new business excluding the impact of currency translation servicing fees were down yearonyear sequentially total servicing fees were up primarily as a result of higher average equity market levels partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments on the bottom panel of this page weve included some sales performance indicators which highlight the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter auca wins in the first quarter totaled billion with about half driven by wins across the growing alternative segment especially in private markets the fee rate on these alternative wins are generally more than times the total servicing fee average which makes this a strong win quarter from a projected revenue standpoint at quarter end auca won but yet to be installed totaled trillion with alpha representing a healthy portion which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy given the planning and preparation since these deals were announced we expect significant onboardings of this uninstalled auca next quarter turning to slide first quarter management fees were million down yearonyear primarily reflecting lower average market levels and a previously reported clientspecific pricing adjustment quarteronquarter management fees were flat as higher market levels were partially offset by outflows and day count as you can see on the bottom right of the slide notwithstanding the difficult macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum in state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 etfs we continue to build on strategic growth segments which was reflected in net flows in our spdr portfolio low cost equity and fixed income suites in our institutional business we saw net outflows while sustaining continued momentum in defined contribution with a target date franchise recording inflows of billion across our cash franchise consistent with industry trends late in the first quarter we saw a flight to quality with significant net inflows worth of cash aum into ssga money market funds since the week ending march which largely reversed the seasonal outflows experienced earlier in the quarter turning now to slide relative to the period a year ago first quarter fx trading services revenue was down primarily reflecting lower client fx volumes partially offset by higher spreads as a reminder the start of the war in europe last year caused some unusually high fx trading activity in sequentially fx trading services revenue exnotables was down with lower spreads offset by higher client volumes and consistent with the significant increases into industrywide money market flows our global link franchise experienced an increase of billion or into its money market cash sweep program during the last three weeks of march securities finance performed well in the first quarter with revenues up yearonyear driven by higher specials activity and an active focus on business returns partially offset by lower balances which was consistent with the industry sequentially revenues were up again mainly driven by higher specials activity which was consistent with the market and securities lending industry environment moving on to software and processing fees first quarter software and processing fees were down yearon year and sequentially primarily driven by lumpy onpremise renewals in the front office software revenues which ill turn to shortly lending fees for the quarter were down both yearonyear and sequentially primarily due to a shift away from products with higher fees but lower returns finally other fee revenue increased million yearonyear primarily due to positive marketrelated adjustments and million sequentially largely due to fair value adjustments on equity investments moving to slide youll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue declined yearonyear primarily as a result of lower onpremise renewals partially offset by continued growth in softwareenabled revenue timing of installations will vary quarteronquarter based on the size and scope of prior business wins and we expect several saas conversions and several onpremise renewals to come through in the second quarter yearonyear our annualized recurring revenue was our softwareenabled revenue was up yearon year but down sequentially due to the absence of an accounting trueup in the fourth quarter turning to some of the other alpha business metrics on the right panel we were pleased to report another alpha mandate win this quarter in the asset owner client segment in addition to the reported win this quarter we expect significant middle office installations in as weve completed the preparations to begin to onboard a portion of a large mandate won back in turning to slide first quarter nii increased yearonyear but declined sequentially to million the yearonyear increase was largely due to higher shortterm rates and proactive balance sheet positioning partially offset by lower deposits sequentially the decline in nii performance was primarily driven by additional state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 client rotation out of noninterest bearing deposit balances partially offset by higher shortterm market rates from central bank hikes on the right of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter yearonyear average assets declined and sequentially average deposits declined quarteronquarter which is relatively consistent with our expectation for first quarter seasonality and client pricing preferences during periods of rising rates of note average weekly deposit levels at quarter end increased as we compare with the week ended march the stress in the regional bank space primarily affected consumer and corporate depositors rather than the institutional asset manager and asset owners that we serve we in contrast saw some risk off deposit inflows at the end of the quarter our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remains consistent at these are determined by regulatory guidance us dollar client deposit betas were to during the quarter as expected foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the to range depending on currency our international footprint continues to be an advantage turning to slide our first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased just yearonyear or up approximately adjusted for currency translation in the light of the current revenue environment we are actively managing expenses while continuing to carefully invest in strategic elements of the company including alpha private markets technology and operations automation compensation and employee benefits increased yearonyear primarily driven by higher salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher head count attributable to lower attrition rates and insourcing total noncompensation expenses on the other hand decreased yearonyear as continued productivity and optimization savings more than offset increases in certain variable costs and professional services on a linebyline basis for noncompensation expenses information systems and communications expenses were down due to benefits from ongoing optimization efforts partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments transaction processing was down mainly reflecting lower subcustody costs from declining market levels as well as lower broker fees and other expenses were up mainly reflecting higher professional fees travel and marketing costs moving to slide on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide as you can see we continue to navigate the operating environment with extremely strong capital levels which are well above our targets let alone the regulatory minimums as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio was up slightly yearonyear but down percentage points quarteronquarter to which was largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program and the expected normalization of rwas that we discussed last quarter tier leverage ratio was flattish at our lcr for state street corporation increased a couple of percentage points quarteronquarter to and percentage points quarteronquarter to for state street bank and trust where most of our business is transacted state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 we were quite pleased to return billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter consisting of billion of common share repurchases and million in common stock dividends lastly given the high level of capital across every measure positive pull to par in aoci and our strong earnings trajectory we continue to expect to return up to billion of capital in the form of buybacks at pace this year subject to market conditions of course turning to slide which provides a summary of our first quarter results while there is certainly still work to do we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a very challenging backdrop and the continued competitive strength of our global franchise next id like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter at a macro level our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards which suggests the fed ecb and bank of england all continue to hike to varying degrees in in terms of markets we currently expect average us equity in global bond markets to be up about to quarteronquarter and international equity markets to be flattish regarding fee revenue in and on a sequential quarter basis we expect overall fee revenue to be up to with servicing fees up to and management fees approximately flat to up we expect to see a significant increase in front office software and data revenues as we have line of sight to a number of onpremise renewals and saas conversions in in our other fee revenue line which we know is difficult to forecast we intend to adopt in the new accounting guidance recently issued regarding renewable energy investments wed expect to see a sequential quarter uptick in total other revenues of between million to million though this estimate always depends on market levels as we adopt this accounting change our effective tax rate for is expected to be approximately the adoption will be roughly neutral to eps regarding nii we now expect nii in the second quarter to decrease to sequentially primarily driven by the noninterestbearing deposit rotation and interestbearing deposit betas as quantitative tightening and rate hikes continue into turning to expenses we remain focused on driving productivity and controlling costs in this environment we expect that second quarter expenses will be flat on a sequential quarter basis excluding the seasonal compensation cost of million overall we will offset some of the nii trends with higher fee revenues as business momentum builds in and through the year and we continue to actively manage expenses and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator we can now open the call for questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions first question comes from ken usdin of jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just wanted to followup on the nii side of things so eric maybe you can just kind of walk through how much of that to in the second quarter is simply the averaging ph that and also just you made a point in a release about how ph dollars has had increased since the early march indiscernible to the end what we think about in terms of your expectations for deposit growth both on an endofperiod and ph average basis going forward as well thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah ken its eric the largest driver of our nii trends right now whether its the fourth quarter or the first quarter or first quarter to second quarter is really the level of noninterestbearing deposits those came down this past quarter about billion we had expected them to come down about billion and we do a fair amount of forecasting on this if you think about january february march it usually comes through in a ushape and we actually had some of the opposite play through in march and so thats whats been driving some of the change in nii and in contrast weve actually seen good flows in interestbearing deposits at the same time so theres a fair amount going on under the surface as we look into second quarter we expect this pace of noninterestbearing deposits to continue to rotate so if you step back last year we had periods where noninterestbearing deposits were up billion then down billion then down billion then down billion right its been quite volatile and right now were expecting noninterestbearing deposits probably to come down another billion billion into the second quarter and if you think about it when you earn or more for those kinds of deposits on the asset side and then pay zero that can be a significant thats a significant amount of nii right every billion is worth million sometimes million per quarter and so thats what we are seeing flowing through the hard work were trying to do from a forecasting standpoint and forecasting is always hard is where does the trend how does the trend play out and we do some of what you probably do which is weve looked at the last peak and the last low of noninterestbearing deposits the peak was the last low was on the other hand in dollar terms the last peak was billion and the last low was about billion and right now were sitting at about billion and so thats whats really playing through the nii forecast and then as we play that out we expect to see some of that noninterestbearing deposit rotate into interestbearing deposits but to be honest some of our clients who are sophisticated institutions are also looking at some of the other strong rates that they can get either in treasuries or money market funds and so at this point in the cycle with the high level of prevailing rates we expect deposits probably to trend down another few billion into the second quarter but this is all kind of dependent on client behavior and activity as we take a look at our forecast state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks eric and just one followup to that is just that the types of changes in client activity is this a different behavior than youve seen in the past in terms of where the ins and outs are coming from i mean obviously we were all expecting deposits to come down as were you and then the events of the last month came through so are clients just making different decisions with what theyre doing with their even operational cash or how would you kind of describe whats happening across the client base thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think clients are the clients are making a variety of different decisions here and i think part of what why were seeing what were seeing is that weve not lived in an environment where interest rates are at right whether you put that at the fed or in three and six months treasuries right and so clients have a fair amount of alternatives and theyre thinking about how to deploy how to maximize interest and yields for their own clients especially the kind of clients we have who are over time will always be price sensitive when it comes to the operational nature of the deposits you can see from our disclosure and we added some of this clients are incredibly sticky and stable from an operational standpoint operational deposit balances were steady and the operational percentages continue to be in a very narrow band you have clients with several billions of dollars each often but they typically have hundreds if not thousands of individual accounts with very significant transactional and payment flows and thats why theyre categorized as operational in nature and so that behavior hasnt changed that behavior of core custodial deposits is deeply ingrained in the structure of those accounts the processing we do for them the avoidance of overdrafts that they always try to that they dont want i think what were seeing instead is clients on the margin will find for their discretionary the ph last dollar of of deposits theyre going to be rate seeking and at these prevailing rates theyre going to look here and there now sometimes we match them with those rates so well offer deposits at exception rates sometimes we help them with their sweeps or some of their treasury repo interest and so theres a variety of different ways we serve our clients and well continue to do that but clearly at this point in the rate cycle you kind of have some of the patterns that you and we would expect to have ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks for the color eric operator thank you the next question comes from brennan hawken of ubs please go ahead adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and good morning this is adam beatty in for brennan just a quick followup on nii and in particular the geographic mix of deposits so youve got kind of fairly steady trends us kind of going up and a higher beta as youve called out in the past and then nonus somewhat going down with a lower beta just wondering if you expect based on what youre seeing right now with your clients those trends to continue in particular will we state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 continue to see pressure on nonus deposit balances and could those betas maybe be going up outside the us as you say the competing yields are somewhat higher thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thanks for the question i think well continue to see a range of behaviors across the geographies i mean i think the way i would describe them is in the us with prevailing rates of where they are you have this noninterest bearing to interestbearing rotation on one hand and then you have clients nudging on pricing in general and were kind of at that point where clients now have incentives just like we do to find a place to settle at with us i think in europe and pound sterling its still new right weve just been at the kind of the first maybe half two thirds of the rate increases and there the betas continue to be in that range and are quite attractive for us theyre good for clients because the clients tend to have somewhat fewer alternatives in those international jurisdictions relative to the us on one hand on the other there tends to be less price sensitivity on the deposits and we do expect that to continue and i think with more rate increases flowing through in the international jurisdictions that allow us to continue to lag modestly the deposit rates that we offer as we see those play through adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc great that makes sense thanks eric and then just turning to the buyback pretty healthy in the quarter you still got the kind of not to exceed target out there so just wondering how youre thinking about that in terms of deposit trends and capital needs and whether some of the disruption in the banking backdrop has maybe affected your thinking around the buyback thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah good question and its something that weve been very deliberate and thoughtful about you can imagine as we saw the events in march unfold weve been thinking daily weekly about how stable is the broader banking system the starting point for us is weve got an incredibly strong balance sheet right our capital ratios are in the range thats basis points above the top end of our range basis points higher than the bottom of our range its basis points above the regulatory requirements and you know many run much thinner in terms of regulatory requirements and weve always chosen to run with this kind of with a healthy buffer so i think on one hand the starting point for us is important in our ongoing decisioning around capital return and were conscious of that on the other hand just like you say we assess the market conditions in the environment not for us because this is not about us its about whats happened in some of the other parts of the banking system we assess those and if we would had economic and banking conditions like they were at the beginning of march i think wed make different statements around our capital buyback and so we feel like theres been a fair amount of healing since the beginning middle of march and we think that gives us that factors into our thinking and then what well do is well continue to evaluate conditions right if market conditions and systemic conditions get more concerning for the system we may pace these differently if they continue to be at these levels of stability that were at we feel confident that we can and should continue to proceed state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 but it will be a weekbyweek reassessment our buybacks arent once and done theyre done over the course of the next to weeks and this is one of those quarters where you do them more linearly than not and so well evaluate but our position of strength is just quite i think quite high and gives us a fair amount of latitude adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc great good context thanks eric operator thank you the next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc could we talk a little bit about the expense outlook and how youre thinking about managing it i know that you mentioned specifically but i just wanted to get your thoughts on how youre thinking about operating leverage either on a total rev basis or more on a fee basis really what im trying to get at is how you think about the nii piece as we think about operating leverage for the and for the full year thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp betsy theres a couple of different ways we look at this and clearly were one quarter into the year weve started to give some outlook for second quarter and we need to see how the conditions and the environment plays out because equity markets up or down bond markets up or down by more than a percentage point or two is going to impact our revenues and so i think its still early in the year we set out this year to drive positive operating leverage and continue to look for ways to do that but we need more information about the external conditions to really see that i think as we think about the opportunities here though nii will trend positively for the year but not as positively as we would have expected so thats a consideration you saw that we took up our fee guide for the second quarter and so that gives us a little more ballast or breathing room or momentum to be honest and well continue to manage expenses quite actively i would say in the last year and a half as nii was up right we didnt spend that on the expense line right we were quite conscious of continuing to drive investment but also productivity and calibrated in our expense growth and so as we look forward well continue to do that but obviously well keep track of the direction of revenues and obviously try to adapt where we can betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 and then just a quick followup on the other fee line that you discussed the ph million increased q2 could you just give us a sense of how we should think about the trajectory of that are you going to be increasing your investment into renewables and so that should be a growing line in line with increase in investments to renewables or is that a onetime stepup and thats just a little color there thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah the revenue impact on that line is a little bit of both and were still discerning all the specifics and doing the forecasting in second quarter we need to do a yeartodate catch up thats how the accounting guidance is written and then there will be some additional revenues in the third and fourth quarter not as much as there would be from the second quarter catchup so were trying to map that out and as the quarter proceeds well try to get a little more guidance out but that line will tend to have instead of kind of being centered around zero will be centered around a slightly higher number in the coming quarters and well try to get some guidance out on that as we go through all the forecasts betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator thank you the next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning gentlemen eric can you share with us how you guys are investing your cash in your securities portfolio in terms of durations that youre looking at are you trying to shorten the duration of the portfolio as you reinvest the cash proceeds that come off at every quarter whats your thinking about that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric weve been quite careful over the years of running a portfolio with a modest amount of duration i think its typically in the years to years in that that provides us some amount of benefit from what historically has been steepness in the yield curve its also given us some ability to create some amount of stabilization in nii without taking the opportunity to benefit from interest rate rises which is what weve been able to do over the last two years we like that amount of duration because it also protects the income statement as rates fall and well see if that if there are rate cuts late in the year or next year or the year after that so that gives us some stability as well i think what id tell you though is we spend as much time on duration and curve shape as we do on carefully also running some mbs portfolios where theres some additional yield pickup but youve got to be careful in terms of the level of convexity risk that you take and then because of our deposit franchise as was mentioned earlier were doing this around the globe weve got about a third of our balance sheets in international jurisdictions and that gives us real opportunities in pound sterling euro canadian aussie dollars et cetera to invest state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 and we may run somewhat different duration levels in those different currencies we might be shorter in one longer another partly to reflect our views on the rate cycle and where each of those are so theres a range of kind of approaches that we take there and we find that our flexibility gives us some opportunities to deliver some good yields and nii but obviously being careful we dont want to stretch for duration we dont want to stretch for yield we want to continue to run a conservative portfolio like we have for many many years gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just to follow up on your comments about deposits i think you said that the low point of noninterest bearing were at billion youre sitting at billion now and twopart question if rates just stay here lets say the fed doesnt start cutting rates later this year and next year and we get a fed funds rate do you sense that the noninterestbearing deposits could approach that billion on a goforward basis and second on your operational accounts do you guys have to pay any interest on those accounts eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me do that in reverse order the operational accounts are sometimes interestbearing sometimes noninterestbearing so theres a wide of different pricing structures but they tend to be remember and these are thousands of accounts often times for each of the asset managers or asset owners that we custody for and its less about the pricing in those accounts than about the nature of the accounts and the payment transactions that clients are funding in effect with the deposits that they leave with us in terms of noninterestbearing deposits i do think well continue to see a trend downwards we saw a billion trend this past quarter which was billion or billion more than we had expected even back at that early even back when we last gave guidance we expect probably another billion billion will come out in the second quarter and then i think we do believe that theres going to begin to be some stabilization id be inclined to think that well get to that billion probably later this year but this is where theres no amount of crystal balling that we can provide its hard to really be sure it could be at that level it could be around that level weve seen movements in noninterestbearing month by month that are plusminus billion billion even in april as an example weve had days where noninterest bearings were in the billion level so billion above the recent average and days when they were at the billion level so its that kind of range and volatility that were trying to forecast through but clearly the trends here and i think the last benchmark of that around that billion level maybe one that we approach potentially later this year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate the insight thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp okay yeah operator thank you the next question comes from jim mitchell of seaport global please go ahead state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a little bit on the fee income story you talked about a pretty hefty sequential growth but not necessarily coming from the servicing line so but you talked about great momentum in servicing and onboarding so how do we think about the trajectory on the servicing fee line as you onboard is it more of a back half story and how are you thinking about full year with servicing fees ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah jim its ron so maybe ill start here on servicing fees as eric noted we do expect growth and its driven by a couple of things one is weve been carrying for a while now a fair amount of auca to be implemented a lot of that was tied to some systems development that needed to occur that is occurring so were expecting to see a hefty amount of that auca to get installed secondly the wins this quarter were while it was a low auca amount it was much more traditional back office plus this very large alternatives both of which are easier to install but they take less time to install so were actually quite pleased with how is shaping up from a sales perspective and its good that its shaping up early in the year so with all that we do expect to have a meaningful amount of servicing fee growth that coupled with depending on what you believe about markets tends to wash over everything that im talking about but if you believe that theres some kind of market stability we feel pretty good about the year as we would look forward eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and jim its eric just to round that out rons covered servicing fees management fees should give us some lift as well as we have some equity market appreciation equity and bond market appreciation into the second quarter i think if you go through the trading lines second quarter is usually good well have to see just how much volumes play through in spread so but youve seen weve been making a nice headway given the market volatility with specials and sec finance that will likely continue in the software and processing line we had one of the lowest onpremise renewal quarters this in and that one just varies if you just look at some of the materials in the deck that could be million it could be million that was literally the swing from fourth quarter to first quarter we expect as we had said some sizable upticks there as well so theres a range of areas and in effect from a management standpoint were focused on every one of the opportunities and businesses and harnessing the client momentum that weve been seeing jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no yeah sure eric yeah i appreciate all that but in terms of the sequential increase of to it seems like a lot of its coming from some of these lumpy revenue streams that dont necessarily continue further out whether its other kind of catch up whether its software processes jumping back state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 but when we think about sort of the momentum in the back half and that sort of new run rate in the second quarter is that sustainable as you gain momentum in some of the more annuitylike revenue streams or do we kind of have to push out a little longer im just trying to get a sense of beyond you have a nice jump in but is that really sustainable eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah no i understand the perspective i think what id though remind you on software and processing we had an unusually low print in the first quarter so the first part of the ph fall up in second quarter is rebound and then continuation onpremise revenues have averaged about million a quarter for example thats a reasonable kind of average that one could expect but we printed million this past quarter so its that kind of i think rebound were expecting in the second quarter and then it should stay within the averages and then beyond that to your point there are the more annuitylike areas whether its the softwareenabled the saas revenues in software whether its some of the we have very flow oriented fx and securities finance books and then as ron mentioned were seeing increasing momentum in servicing fees and management fees and the servicing fee momentum is spread as weve mentioned both in terms of back office and in middle office which gives us additional diversity its hard for us to predict the second half of the year and ill hesitate every april to reestimate the full year but i think well know more as we get to june and july and ill certainly give be able to give you an indication but were certainly seeing momentum of activity with clients and expect some of these onboardings to come through and we think that provides a step up and then there should be some continuation beyond second quarter that will be positive jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right well thanks for all the color eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator thank you the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research please go ahead sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning this is actually sharon leung on for steven for nii i know you noted that you it will still be up but maybe not as meaningfully as the you had guided to you previously is there any numbers you can put around that for example assuming that the nib rotation continues as expected and you get to that billion number sometime in the year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i mean this is where the forecast just have a wide range of outcomes i think given the first quarter report and what we expect in the second quarter we dont think that one can reach that at up for the full year i state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 think what were wrestling with is just whats the pace of rotation and whats the pace of some of the price sensitivity that we see in the us clients at this point in the cycle and thats whats harder to determine so theres a range of forecasts we have and if i had to kind of share with you id say if one thinks of it in a more ph dollar way and expects more rotation and more price sensitivity nii could be up to this year instead of on the other hand if one is optimistic and believe some of the history where there is real attenuation in the noninterest bearing deposits nii could be up to so theres a larger range than usual in the forecast that we have and to be honest just like i quoted some of the april yeartodate data and the range of levels that were seeing we expect that those we expect to be that there will be quite a bit of range in the outcomes just really hard to predict but maybe that gives you some perspective its probably a larger range than youre looking for but were trying to be as transparent and forthcoming as we can given the facts and the information that we have here sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you very much operator thank you the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess just a couple of quick followups eric one on nii i heard all your comments in the qa just trying to make sense of is the customer behavior that surprised you today versus january given that you probably assume that rates were going a little bit higher than where we were back in jan or is it the events of the last month that have changed customer behavior and increased the intensity of repricing eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp no i dont think its really the events of the last month which are really in very different client segments different geographies those are very different from what we do and who we serve and we had a little bit of a flight to quality not flight to quality we had a bit of this riskoff sentiment with deposits but thats just a whole different ecosystem than those clients that we serve i think whats really happening here and what weve been trying to estimate but maybe is unestimatable or unforecastable is just how do clients operate when prevailing rates are at in the united states right weve not had that scenario in our for some of us in our careers right but for some of us going back many many probably two decades and so the datas thin on that question and i think what weve seen is back in january when we had given some of our nii guidance for the quarter just on noninterest bearing deposits we had seen one quarter where they were up a little bit one quarter where they were down billion and then the third to fourth quarter they were down billion right so youre in this situation where youre trying to guess forecast estimate we can weve got to use all those words and i think we thought we might have reached some attenuation but we didnt there was another step of rotation playing through its not irrational for clients to do that and so theyve shifted now they shift from noninterestbearing to interestbearing they shift across currency sometimes because of their sophistication i think whats interesting is that we actually got more deposits in the us and we had some state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 outflows in or some net reductions in europe and in asia and so you kind of have a real mix out there and i think what were realizing is all the data sets we have are actually not theres not enough data on this question of deposit or ill call it deposit or pricing behavior because thats what this is about and thats what were trying to better estimate but the clients were serving were continuing to serve the momentum in the business is clear and just like nii went up faster than we had thought i think theres a trend here that its coming down a bit sequentially its still going to be up for the full year but well need to see how much ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just a separate question i know its small for you but the other element that ph youve provisioned higher the credit portfolio rating remind us of or the credit sensitivity that we should expect from the balance sheet from an economic downturn if there are more rating agency downgrades like what that means from a credit cost provisioning perspective as we look forward eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah its good question i mean the aside from the provision thats calculated using all the cecl techniques and fairly regimented that we had for the one cash placement that we ph made the provision was about million i think for us provisions have been in the million million million range typically weve seen a little bit of migration or change in ratings in a half dozen credits but its a kind of thing that plays through and part of that is we have higher prevailing rates and that puts a little bit of pressure in different parts of the economy and i think its probably fairly typical i think the we run quite a highquality and highgrade lending book even where were a little more down market we call bbs down market right so we have a ratings distributions that are typically in the a or a or even better range so well have some sensitivity to economic conditions you can go back to around the start of covid right the number of banks built reserves that can give you a sense of sensitivity but we feel like were wellreserved now given what we know both on the economic conditions and individual positions that we hold its highly diversified its high quality and well obviously well continue to monitor but feel like its a reasonably stable with a little bit of drift down situation just given the direction of rates in the economy ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator thank you the next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi as you know the markets been a little ph generations silicon valley and can you just make it crystal clear i mean i think i know the answer but i need you to really explain why this is an earnings issue and not a liquidity issue and on the earnings issue just to make sure i heard you correctly your noninterest bearing deposits went from billion down to billion you think base case it might go down to billion but the state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 low end of the range which is possible later this year would be billion that would be going maybe non interestbearing deposits from billion down to billion thatd be billion less in free money you said it was million to million per billion so just taking the worst case you go down to the billion it hurts you million were talking about million of earnings lost which might be around or of your eps if you look at kind of a run rate sort of thing so first is my math correct there that that is the earnings issue and then reassure if its appropriate that this is not a liquidity issue ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp mike why dont i start i think that as youre calculating the worst case i think your math roughly is correct were doing all we can to avoid the worst case but i think your math and how you get to the earnings impact is right assuming the in effect margin on the deposits in terms of liquidity theres nothing here that approaches a liquidity issue right these are custody deposits as eric noted theyre operating deposits they give you a sense and a little more explanation of why weve got x number of clients but a multiple number of accounts and if you think about it a mutual fund company probably has at least one account per fund they have with us if not more its to actually run their funds if you look at the liquidity coverage ratio which eric walked you through its up at now its actually gone up not down so yes this is an earnings issue and one that we intend to offset to the extent possible with the primary source of our revenue which is fees as well as continued careful management of expenses mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then a followup to that you said youre not changing your buyback so you have billion for the year youve done billion so you have billion left with the current market decline that would be of your market cap so to the extent you see this as a step down but not lifethreatening whats your appetite towards completing that buyback and how soon are you able to enter the market ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp i mean mike i think eric explained it well if you look at our capital levels and the fact that we that held off buying back shares for quite a large amount of basically for most of last year we feel comfortable continuing the buyback were obviously conscious of the environment so we feel comfortable doing that and we certainly feel comfortable about ourselves but there is a system in which we live and to the extent to which the system started to look very different from what it is today look a whole lot more like or even worse than what we saw in march were certainly not going to ignore that but based on what we know now and our financial strength we think its actually quite prudent to do so and our forecasting puts us i mean we dont think about it in terms of market cap we think about it in terms of whats our cet1 ratio our capital ratio and this will still put us above our range so well within our range i mean so this is something that at this point we feel very comfortable doing eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 and mike its eric id just underscore right the capital and liquidity strength and ratios are just incredibly high and ph we lost by every measure that one can see and weve shared quite a bit of that and thats the reason why were comfortable at this point proceeding with our buyback well i said in my prepared remarks we do it through the rest of the year i said we do it at pace and even within a quarter we typically start buybacks the day after earnings and then we will operate and execute on them subject to market conditions of course but typically execute on them over the to weeks of available days during the quarter so weve got good confidence in the broader system and enormous confidence in our particular position here on earnings well work through the earnings issue nii is something that we can figure our balance sheet to earn when rates move up and the balance sheet does give some of that back when rates come down and well obviously continue to drive our focus on fees and manage expenses and drive what really is a multiyear trajectory mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc one last time crystal clear so theres nothing about the reduction in the free money noninterestbearing deposits or anything else in your results that would give you pause to continue buying back your stock ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp none mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator thank you the next question comes from rob wildhack of autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp hi guys i wanted to unpack some of the rwa dynamics in the quarter rwas were up sequentially but the overall balance sheet i think was down or so can you just give us some color on what was going on there eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure rob its eric and i think theres some materials on rwa both in the earnings deck on page and then further back in the addendum i think if you remember fourth quarter we had a particularly low print in rwa which we had signaled at our fourth quarter earnings call in january overdrafts came in lower than expected some of the riskweighted assets associated with the fx books came in lower because of the late december move in dollar rates and so we had expected a rebound of about billion billion of rwa from fourth quarter to first quarter and you saw we got about billion or billion of that we still came in a little light on overdrafts which is fine part of that is the amount of cash in the system and the cash and deposits that were holding on behalf of our clients you see rwa is still down yearoveryear and thats because of a fair number of optimization efforts we state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 felt like theres real opportunities for us to grow the franchise on one hand but deploy rwas in very high quality and higher returning ways on the other and support our clients and so weve been adjusting the deployment across the fx books you think about how much we want to deploy in the forward space and the longdated forwards versus spot and securities finance there are different amounts but were quite welloff when it comes to capital and our plans here really to continue to find ways to smartly deploy additional capital and additional rwa to drive organic growth robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you and then i appreciate the color on the tobe installed business and the onprem enterprise trajectory from here but could you just remind us how long those installs typically take to convert to revenue eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah when we described the installation going into the second quarter we were describing those as realized revenue installations so in effect the way the accounting works typically is when we win we dont book the revenues but its only at the installation date that you begin to book them so youll see both the backlog assets under custody in the second quarter begin to come down and some of the servicing and middle office revenues float upwards and similarly for the software and data processing areas youll see something in that direction as well robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you operator thank you the next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi eric hi ron a couple of questions firstly crd revenues i know you said it should eric the onpremise revenue should bounce back in the second quarter but just want to step back and look at it on a full year basis the entire crd revenues what is your expectation at this point for full year growth in that looking at all those three subcomponents together eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i dont vivek i dont know that we in january we went into that level of detail i think what weve said in the past is that that theres a range of revenue growth in our different fee categories weve described back office is growing towards the traditional back office growing closer to the lower singledigit revenue growth weve described middle and front office which would include crd at high singledigit growth state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 there will be years when it could be doubledigit revenue growth so thats what we said about that category this category i think what we see in particular in software is the onpremise revenues over time will may not be as ph heady but we do see real momentum in the combination of the software enabled and saas but all in that should grow in the higher singledigit revenues typically although therell be some range around that in a given year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then going back to this question thats come up on the large amount of new business that remains to be installed in servicing and you said you should see a pickup in ron and eric whats your expectation for how much of that do you expect would get installed over the course of this year by the time we exit this year how much should be done and therefore what benefit should there be indiscernible from that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think vivek there are a couple of ways to think about that because what happens here is that it gets onboarded in tranches so we might onboard the assets under custody and administration but there are multiple services that were often providing for those assets so we had a couple of wins over the last year or two years with trillion those trillion wins would have had some custody some accounting they might have had some performance analytics they would have had some middle office services in many cases because they were alpha mandates so theres three four or five kind of ill call it revenue installations right for each of the balances that sit there when we describe them as assets under custody and administration i think roughly our view is that wed expect about half of the backlog in custody and administration to come through during the course of this year ill say that roughly right it tends to vary and then the revenue pieces it wont be quite at that level because the revenues come through over time as you get the different ill call it layers of services that are provided associated with that assets under custody and administration but what well do is well i think its that may be some kind of broad perspective what well try to do each quarter is give you more and more visibility as we get to those implementation points because remember these are implementations where not only have we configured a fronttoback offering that weve designed for clients but clients need to reconfigure many of their processes and systems in parallel with that to adopt and so its a joint effort on both sides vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc if i may sneak in one more just cf global any color on what that could add to your fee revenue eric and when do you expect that to start to add when exactly eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i mean cf global for us is a very attractive opportunity weve historically done some outsourced trading over the years in the us and asia we learned particularly large in that space in europe this gives us some real heft and credibility in europe its an acquisition that will close likely at the end of the year so i think its really a topic state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2023 and were looking at a business like that between what we have and what were adding to be in the million to million range of revenues next year and weve got some of that today but this what we purchased in cf global really is distinguishing in terms of capabilities product lines lets us build around what we have and then drive some real incremental growth and so something were very excited about because it fits into being the enterprise outsourcer you do that for a custody accounting middle office front office and we do it for the cios of small and midsized companies and its really it fits very well with our positioning and strength vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call over to mr ohanley for closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks operator and thanks to all on the call for joining us operator ladies
