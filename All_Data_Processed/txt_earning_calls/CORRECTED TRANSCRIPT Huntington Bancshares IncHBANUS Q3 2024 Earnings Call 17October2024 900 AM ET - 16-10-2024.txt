morning everyone and welcome thank you for joining the call today we are very pleased to report outstanding results for the third quarter which zach will detail later continues to be a dynamic year and our yeartodate results demonstrate huntingtons strength and consistent performance these strong results reflect the dedication of our nearly colleagues across the bank who live our purpose every day as we make peoples lives better help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve now on to slide there are five key messages we want to share with you today first we are driving accelerated loan growth along with sustained deposit growth these results are supported by our core businesses as well as the successful execution of new initiatives including expanded geographies and commercial banking verticals second we are actively executing our down beta playbook as the market enters a declining fed rate cycle we are dynamically managing the balance sheet and coupled with our growth outlook we expect to deliver record net interest income in third we continue to drive fee revenues higher with sustained momentum across our three major focus areas payments wealth management and capital markets fourth our credit performance remained strong during the quarter with stable net chargeoffs as well as lower nonperforming and criticized assets this is a direct result of our consistent disciplined credit management and our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite finally our performance during the quarter sets the foundation for continued organic growth and increased profitability into and beyond i will move us on to slide to recap our performance we delivered accelerated loan growth in the quarter with average balances growing by from a year ago end of period loans increased at a annualized rate average deposit growth continued at a robust pace increasing by billion or over the past year we drove capital ratios higher again with adjusted common equity tier of this benefited both from capital accretion from earnings as well as reduced aoci our fee revenue strategies are delivering with gaap fee income increasing by yearoveryear on an adjusted basis core fee revenues demonstrated robust growth increasing by from a year ago driven by payments wealth management and capital markets we are sustaining momentum in the growth of primary bank customer relationships as we continue to acquire new customers across the footprint consumer pbrs have increased by and business banking pbrs have increased by yearoveryear we have delivered pbr growth consistently with yearoveryear increases for over a dozen consecutive quarters we have continued to invest across the company to drive sustained organic growth last month we were pleased to announce our full franchise and branch expansion into the carolinas this builds upon the success of our earlier investments in the commercial and regional banking teams over the past year these markets represent some of the most attractive geographies nationally given their size and growth characteristics we have hired wellestablished colleagues with local expertise in these markets and the results today are tracking much better than our initial business case weve also invested substantially in our payments businesses particularly in treasury management including bringing inhouse our merchant acquiring capabilities the merchant acquiring business completed its final testing phase in september and implemented its full commercial launch in early october the opportunity within merchant is substantial and when at scale we expect it will add percentage point to overall fee revenue growth huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 credit trends overall are holding up very well supported by our long track record of disciplined client selection our consumer portfolios are constructed around prime and super prime exposures within these portfolios consumer delinquency rates remained stable we are continuing to see sound fundamentals from our commercial customers theyve managed this rate cycle and inflationary changes well with stable revenue and profitability trends overall our customers continued to show strength and resiliency which supports a constructive outlook for sustained organic growth we exited the third quarter with robust production levels in september and with momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter as an example our regional banking group posted record loan production exppp in the third quarter heading into the fourth quarter latestage commercial pipelines at quarter end are up from a year ago our teams are actively implementing our down beta action plans fee revenue growth was robust in the third quarter and we have confidence in our many initiatives including merchant acquiring as well as the outlook for capital markets and advisory revenues given strong pipelines as we enter the fourth quarter we are maintaining disciplined expense management while continuing to invest the additional efficiency actions we took in the third quarter will support our ability to sustain investment into revenue producing initiatives into credit remains a hallmark of huntington with stable chargeoffs and improved nonperforming and criticized assets in closing we have confidence in our ability to sustain our organic growth outlook as we finish the year and move into zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our third quarter results we reported earnings per common share of the quarter included million of notable items on a net basis and did not have an impact to earnings per share return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was preprovision net revenue or ppnr increased by from the prior quarter this was driven by net interest income which expanded by and fee revenues which increased by from the prior quarter average loan balances increased by billion or versus last year average deposits continued to grow increasing by billion or on a yearoveryear basis credit quality remains strong with net chargeoffs of basis points allowance for credit losses decreased by basis points and ended the quarter at adjusted cet1 ended the quarter at and increased roughly basis points from last quarter supported by earnings as well as the recapture of aoci from lower rates tangible book value per share has increased by yearoveryear turning to slide consistent with our plan and prior guidance yearoveryear average loan growth is accelerating q3 loan growth was yearover year rising from last quarters growth and the we posted in q1 average loan balances increased sequentially by billion excluding runoff from commercial real estate loans increased by billion or huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 as steve mentioned end of period loans increased by and represented a annualized growth rate loan growth in the quarter was supported by strong contributions from core businesses and from new initiatives our new initiatives collectively represented million of growth in the quarter and included carolinas texas fund finance healthcare assetbased lending and native american financial services note this pace of growth was above the second quarter level as teams continued to ramp up and we expect growth in the fourth quarter to be further above these levels other drivers of loan growth in the third quarter included million from consumer auto million from regional banking million from residential mortgage million from auto floor plan million from rvmarine million from all other consumer categories on a net basis and million from all other commercial categories on a net basis this growth was partially offset by a seasonal decline in distribution finance which was lower by million generally we see the third quarter as the seasonal low point in the year for this business given inventory levels across our mix of programs we expect inventories to build into the fourth quarter and resulting balances to be higher in the fourth quarter on average compared to the third quarter turning to slide as noted we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth average deposits increased by billion or in the third quarter on a full quarter basis total cost of deposits increased by basis points in the third quarter and interestbearing deposit costs were flat for the quarter within the quarter there were notable declines in deposit costs we saw total cost of deposits decline sequentially in both august and september with september costs lower by basis points this is a direct result of our proactive and disciplined execution of our down beta action plans in advance of the feds basis point rate cut in september and continuing into q4 these actions reflect our active balancing of deposit volumes and rate given our robust deposit growth over the past year were in a strong position to optimize rates from here we will remain very dynamic in managing the business and our action plan as this interest rate environment evolves our forecast is aligned with a forward curve which projects two additional basis point rate cuts by year end and a further five basis point rate cuts in as we noted in the past several quarters related to guidance on up beta the performance and trajectory of down beta will be a function of the actual and projected path of rates and importantly customer expectations for that path based on the current rate outlook we continue to project a cumulative down beta in the mid to high by the fourth quarter of and in the mid range by the fourth quarter of turning to slide our cumulative deposit growth since early totaled this level continues to well outpace the peer group as a result weve been able to decisively implement the down beta strategy to fund loan growth with deposits and at the same time manage the loantodeposit ratio lower over the past year which will support the continued acceleration of lending on to slide for the quarter net interest income increased by million or to billion we delivered sustained growth off of the trough levels from the first quarter of this year consistent with our guidance net interest margin was for the third quarter reconciling the change in nim from q2 we saw a decrease of basis point this was due to spread net of free funds lower by basis points higher cash balances driving margin lower by basis points partially offset by lower drag from the hedging program which improved by basis points we continue to project full year net interest income to be within our prior guidance range the fourth quarter level is expected to be flat to up on a yearoveryear basis and then resume growth over the first half huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 of and accelerate in the second half this is expected to result in record net interest income for based on current rate curve expectations we continued to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing with loan yields expanding by basis points from the prior quarter this occurred even as sofr moved lower during the quarter as a reminder we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both shortterm rates as well as the slope and belly of the curve as i noted earlier our working assumption includes two additional rate cuts by yearend and a further five cuts in and underlies this net interest income outlook turning to slide our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from sustained deposit growth we expect cash and securities as a percentage of total average assets to remain at approximately as the balance sheet grows over time we are reinvesting securities cash flows in treasuries and expect to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio at approximately the current range we have increased the average duration of new securities purchases from very short half year duration to slightly longer two to three year durations which is a component of our strategy to systematically reduce asset sensitivity over the next several quarters turning to slide over the course of the rate cycle weve positioned the company to benefit from asset sensitivity as the rate environment moved higher and are now reducing our level of asset sensitivity as market expectations are increasingly weighted toward a down rate path that strategy has worked well to maximize the benefit from the rate cycle and protect capital while managing nim within a tight corridor on the bottom of the slide there is an illustration of the asset sensitivity path over the next several quarters in q3 we lowered our asset sensitivity by more than onethird from the second quarter looking forward we expect the total cumulative reduction in asset sensitivity from q2 to be greater than by yearend and moving to above by mid2025 as always we will continue to dynamically manage our hedging program to achieve our objectives of capital protection and nim stabilization moving on to slide on an overall level gaap noninterest income increased by million to million for the third quarter adjusting for the impacts of crt transactions and the payfixed swaptions marktomarket from the prior year fee revenues increased by million or on a core underlying basis moving on to slide our strategy to increase the penetration and usage of valueadded fee services is building on momentum we have created over the last several years adjusted fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues have increased from a year ago to in q3 this reflects the focused effort on key initiatives across payments wealth management and capital markets within payments revenues have increased by million in the third quarter and have increased by million yearoveryear commercial payments revenues including treasury management fees have grown strongly increasing by from the prior year debit card revenue grew by yearoveryear reflecting performance higher than industry averages yet clearly impacted by the relatively slower levels of consumer spending growth we are seeing economy wide other cardbased revenues continued to grow yearoveryear supported by consumer credit card spending trends the addition of merchant acquiring inhouse capabilities will further support our overall payments revenue growth as we enter the fourth quarter and carry into as steve noted earlier we see this initiative adding approximately percentage point to overall fee revenue growth next year huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 within wealth management revenue growth was outstanding increasing from the prior year advisory relationships have increased by yearoveryear and assets under management have increased on a yearoveryear basis these results benefited from sustained positive net asset flows within capital markets we saw exceptionally strong revenue growth increasing by million or from the prior year to million these results were driven by commercial bankingrelated capital markets revenues which are accelerating as we have previously guided as a result of higher commercial loan production as we look out into q4 we expect to post another quarter of sequential growth in capital markets driven by continued underlying core bankingrelated services and a robust advisory pipeline we expect this positive momentum to carry into moving on to slide on expenses gaap noninterest expense increased by million and underlying core expenses also increased by million during the quarter we incurred million of expenses related to efficiency programs which will benefit our expense outlook and allow us to reinvest savings into key revenue producing initiatives additionally this was partially offset by a million benefit from the fdic special assessment net notable items for the quarter totaled million excluding these items core expenses came in slightly better than our expectations for the quarter at billion the increase in core expenses quarteroverquarter was primarily driven by personnel expenses due to higher salaries and benefit costs we also saw million of higher expenses related to merchant acquiring as we brought that business inhouse and launched our services in october we continue to forecast approximately core expense growth for the full year slide recaps our capital position common equity tier ended the quarter at our adjusted cet1 ratio inclusive of aoci was and has grown basis points from a year ago our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth we intend to drive adjusted cet1 inclusive of aoci into our operating range of to on slide credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well net chargeoffs were basis points in q3 relatively stable over the past four quarters allowance for credit losses at declined by basis points from the prior quarter and reflects both modestly improved economic outlook as well as an increased loan portfolio on slide the criticized asset ratio decreased by from the prior quarter to the nonperforming asset ratio declined by basis point to basis points turning to slide our outlook for the full year remains unchanged from our prior guidance our expectations for the fourth quarter include accelerating loan growth at approximately to on a yearoveryear basis deposit growth is expected to increase between and on a yearoveryear basis we see full year net interest income unchanged from our prior guidance range the fourth quarter level is expected to be flat to up on a yearoveryear basis and then resume growth in the first half of and accelerating in the second half core fee revenues adjusted for the swaptions and crt items are expected to grow at approximately to year overyear in the fourth quarter core expenses are well managed and tracking to our full year outlook for the fourth quarter we expect growth of approximately yearoveryear subject to some variability given revenuedriven compensation levels as well as expenses related to the insourcing of our merchant acquiring business which brings with it direct offsetting fee huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 revenues this is consistent with our previous commentary to exit the year at a lowsingle digit yearoveryear expense growth rate credit is performing well aligned with our expectations and net charge offs are projected to be relatively similar to q3 our tax rate for the fourth quarter is likely to be between and with that well conclude our prepared remarks and move over to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thank you zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you and our first question is from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning so the guidance for nii i think implies that nii should be flat to slightly down versus can you talk about whats driving that is that just a timing difference between those floating rate asset yields coming down and deposit costs coming down zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks manan this is zach ill take that one and the short answer to your question is yes its just a short timing difference between the really powerful and very effective actions weve seen on reducing deposit costs which you saw some of the trends weve illustrated in the third quarter those will continue into the fourth quarter just not fully offsetting on a shortterm basis the reductions in variable yields i think well exit q4 having a positive run rate benefit from deposit costs relative to asset yields with the early part of the quarter assuming again two more rate cuts which is our forecast here well likely be a little lower quartertoquarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and can you share more color on the deposit growth there it looks like youve continued to grow deposits faster than loans this quarter is that mostly coming from new account growth and i guess the question there is why not pay down some of the higher cost cds to help nii and have deposits grow a little bit slower than loans given that you prefunded a lot of the loan growth in the first half of the year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah a terrific question manan that is effectively the plan were really pleased to see how much deposit growth weve seen throughout the course of this year obviously very significantly faster than the industry average overall and that really puts us in a pretty strong position now with having brought down loantodeposit ratio and just given how strong that deposit gathering has been to now turn and drive down beta and begin to decelerate deposit growth even as loan growth is accelerating so if you look at the guidance weve given for deposits into the fourth quarter i would expect the balances to be relatively flat actually quartertoquarter even as they still grow yearonyear and thats really an indication that were doing exactly what you just said leveraging that position to really drive our funding costs lower manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator our next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc two things one i guess zach just wanted to follow up i think you mentioned nii i guess you have the guidance for fourth quarter and then did you mean to say that the growth accelerated from the one the versus level as we think about first half and then get even faster through the course of if you could just clarify that and with that whats the sensitivity to rate cuts right we had very strong retail sales to the markets actively recalibrating what the fed may or may not do just talk to us whether getting three to four cuts versus not getting those cuts means much in terms of your nii outlook huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah great question we appreciate the attempt to unpack it and clarify a bit so our general expectations for nim are to be a few basis points lower into the fourth quarter really driven by what i was talking about for manans question earlier just a short timing impact before which before accelerating beta starts to fully offset and more than offset the variable impacts on variable loans i will note as well that one of the major benefits well have to nim here is our hedging program and just for the facts we had around basis points of hedge drag in the second quarter sorry in the third quarter thats going to reduce if you look at the forward yield curve down to basis points in q4 and flip over the course of to a basis point benefit by the end of so beta accelerating and the hedge drag continually reducing and then beginning to be a hedge benefit as you go throughout the course of next year really are the drivers of why we expect to see sustained nim expansion from the q4 level into q1 into q2 and q3 and then continuing on from there so expect to see a nice upward drift in nim from the q4 level throughout the course of and when you couple that with the really robust loan growth were driving thatll be what drives nii higher over the course of we expect as i noted in my prepared remarks record nii dollars in really driven by those two factors ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and i guess zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc and then just maybe ill expand a bit on your question on sensitivities so i think your point is very well noted its a pretty dynamic environment here for sure and while our underlying forecast assumes a couple more rate cuts this quarter and then five into next year you could very well not see those as you noted i think in the short term for us if you saw less rate cuts you could see a even better nim performance and even better nii dollar performance of course as you know well what would also matter a lot is the reason why youre not seeing those rate reductions and what that would imply about customer and market beliefs about where rates are going and so over the longer term that would have uncertain impacts but in the shortterm it would be universally positive for us to have less rate cuts if there is more i think again it kind of matters why i do think for example earlier this year when we saw market expectations for rate reductions really accelerate a lot that was very helpful to drive the actions around down beta and so you did see more rate reductions while it might produce a little bit of shortterm headwinds over the longer term it might actually be even better for down rate deposit pricing and so again sort of a little uncertain over the short over the long term there if rates are even faster now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just one thing you talked earlier about traction in carolinas just how loan growth was evolving talk to us in terms of deposit growth you did hire sort of a big team on the mortgage side weve seen mortgage rates pull back but either that team or just the overall deposit gathering strategy beyond promotional rates where do you see deposit growth coming from huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i mean what weve seen with deposit performance throughout the year is consumer has been really really strong but over the course of the last several quarters commercial now starting to really catch up and i think thats driven both by our core commercial business but also by some of the new verticals and new markets the mortgage service vertical in particular has been doing really well driving a couple billion dollars of incremental deposits in the third quarter and kind of like weve noted before that that could well continue growth in the longer term here as well so its commercial is now beginning to accelerate and i think as we have an outlook for i would expect were generally expecting continued deposit growth with the mix being slightly more commercial than consumer as we go into next year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc couple one clarification i think maybe a simple question but youre saying fourth quarter nii around billion billion something like that am i reading that right zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc were expecting between million to million lower sequentially jon that will be around flat to up on a yearoveryear basis again assuming not only the million cut we just had but another million here in the last few months of this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thats helpful thank you for that and then kind of a simple question funny question but on slide i kind of want to joke about the scaling of that but the fourth quarter bar chart implies higher nii is there odd question is there any scaling to that zach or what kind of an acceleration do you expect in nii growth throughout the year huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc im expecting pretty steady nii dollar growth from q1 to q2 from q2 to q3 and continuing on jon i think the kind of the path of nim and also we are starting now to get into a bit of overly level of precision at this point given all the uncertainties with it but generally speaking im expecting to see nice sustained nim expansion in q1 q2 q3 and a bit topping out into q4 but well see where the rate environment is at that point and the dollars really being pretty steady growth throughout the year as lending sustains at a fairly solid level is probably the best way to answer to your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay good yeah if i can squeeze one more in i apologize for doing this but the merchant acquiring youre saying growth to overall fee revenues are you saying that could be a million business is that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc currently jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc too much or am i reading that right zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah a little bit off we make roughly million on a run rate annual basis for merchant acquiring in the old outsourced model that we have as we insource that business were thinking next year is going to be fill the million in terms of overall revenue which is thats an extra million sort of about of the overall fee revenue base as you go into next year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you for clarifying this zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah good questions operator our next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning erika operator erika perhaps your line may be muted you are live for question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc can you hear me zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes we can hear you now go ahead yeah we can hear you erika go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay apologies sorry about that so zach as you can imagine everybody is asking about the blank box on for slide so maybe ill ask it this way so consensus wants to fill that box that would imply yearover year growth from your implied fourth quarter so im assuming that has loan growth and also the nim inflection so with that with consensus filling that box in it up quarter overquarter are they in the right ballpark as we think about your loan growth momentum and the dynamics of your balance sheet zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc well im not going to give that level of guidance precision at this point of the year erika as you know we will give guidance as we get into the early part of next year but i dont think thats directionally wrong frankly i think were expecting to see nims rise throughout the course of i mentioned earlier i see nim above in the second half of next year if you compare that to where well be this year that will be a nice nim expansion off of our forecast for q4 so thatll drive some yearoveryear growth and then our current run rate on loan growth is around on an annualized pace right now and theres nothing that indicates we will not be able to sustain that pace into next year in fact the fourth quarter looks outstanding in terms of loan growth and the momentum weve got across the business and so those are relatively good underlying drivers to get to the number youre talking about without being overly declarative on guidance at this point erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc no thats helpful thank you and on the expense run rate i think zach what you and steve have been talking about in terms of investments really showed through with regards to your yearoveryear quarterover quarter sorry yearoveryear fourth quarter guide for fourth quarter relative to the run rate for this year and were seeing it in the loan growth as we think about next year with the caveat that huntington under this management team and board is constantly investing should we expect more of a harvest year so to speak in that perhaps that fourth quarter run rate yearoveryear is more sustainable rather than the zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question in the area of expenses its something that were incredibly rigorously focused on and this year is playing out pretty much exactly like we expected hitting the roughly yearoveryear growth decelerating throughout the year as you noted and really erika staying focused on the model weve got driving efficiencies in baseline expenses you saw us take another series of actions in the third quarter and those are continuing on its a fairly continual process of driving our engineering to enable us to really drive the offensive huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 expense categories that are investmentrelated technology development marketing additions of people to go and drive some new great revenue producing initiatives the plan for is the same as weve had before strive for positive operating leverage i do expect to look into the point of your last question have a pretty solid revenue growth trajectory and so i dont intend to we collectively dont intend to be in harvest mode we want to keep driving for growth but certainly to drive very solid improvement in positive operating leverage and efficiency ratio and then just to sustain that as we go forward erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you so much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks erika operator our next questions are from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning question on fee revenues came in a decent amount better than you expected with the intra quarter guide i assume a lot of that swing is the capital markets and maybe the loan sale but just anything else that surprised you that youd want to call out i mean all the categories actually did pretty well so i guess im just wondering what was zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc kind of better than what you thought a month ago thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question matt and it was primarily capital markets that you noted in the basis of your question we were expecting to see a pretty solid q3 for capital markets but it beat our expectations even better than that overall really really pleased with the execution the sustained level of performance were seeing in the three key areas of focus yearoveryear growth in fees is pretty outstanding from our perspective the outlook for q4 is likewise pretty solid particularly in capital markets i think well see another really good quarter of sequential growth in cap markets wealth continues to drive good underlying household acquisition and net flows and payments really chugging along here particularly with the addition of merchant acquiring should be a nice lift tailwind to growth huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then on the credit risk transfer the crts as you call it now that youve got youre approaching your targeted capital level even including aoci and youve got all the funding and all those positives is that something that youre looking to do lots of going forward or unwind them zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question on the plan to grow capital we feel really good about how thats going and as weve noted a number of times the primary and most significant driver of our plan to continue to drive capital higher is just core organic earnings and strong return on capital we look at these crt transactions as really tactical as opportunistic theyre kind of a interesting innovation in the marketplace for sure that offer great low return on capital for certain asset classes just look back to the transaction we did in the second quarter we unlocked basis points of capital for less than cost of capital just million plus transaction costs so very very efficient so if its possible well be opportunistic in the future around these but theyre really we see them in that way opportunistic and the core is really the underlying return on capital and organic earnings matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator operator instructions our next questions are from the line of sean sorahan with evercore isi please proceed with your question sean sorahan q analyst evercore group llc good morning i was hoping you could address stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning sean sorahan q analyst evercore group llc trends and strategy in the auto business production stepped up again linked quarter and can you talk about the growth outlook there a little bit huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 and then maybe shifting to credit there was a big update may quarter from an auto peer and you saw a little bit of a step up in ph eq this quarter can you address expected credit trends giving shifting auto values thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah sean thanks for the questions this is zach ill take the first part and then brendan will tack on for the second part around indiscernible so were really pleased actually with what were seeing in the auto loan production area auto for us is a terrific asset to lean into at times like this one of the general expectation for rates is to be reducing nice fixed asset class its got about a twoyear duration remember this is prime and super prime credit quality so very solid underlying returns and also incredibly efficient business for us this is a efficiency ratio business for us that it is very very optimizable we can put in pricing in the market up friday see the impacts of it over the weekend dial it back in again the next tuesday as we go into the next week and so really really optimizable and precision return calibration for us here so we like this one i think the production levels for the fourth quarter look to be around the same as the third quarter last year so i think weve hit a nice run rate at this point and then well see where it goes out into the course of next year but for right now nice fixed asset that were getting very significant fixed asset repricing benefits coming through into the nim brendan over to you on credit brendan a lawlor a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure sean this is brendan and given our history in this industry we have the ability to utilize our custom scorecard to really drive the customer selection that zach was referencing and that continues to be a strength for us weve seen latestage legacy and chargeoffs that remain right in our historical levels so were not seeing broad deterioration at all here and frankly with our deep industry expertise and with traditionally lower than the peer set when it comes to chargeoffs or delinquencies and that trend continues this quarter so we feel real confident at this point stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc sean weve been this is steve weve been very disciplined we got years of quarterly track record here its an area of continued focus and discipline as well as weve

helpful i noticed your receive fixed balance in the back half of came down a bit this quarter versus last can you update us on any adjustments made there in the quarter and then maybe highlight any future adjustments here youre thinking about thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 yeah thanks for bringing that question up sean so what we tried to illustrate in that slide is really the continued dynamic management of asset sensitivity really bringing down asset sensitivity a lot both i mean a third reduction in sensitivity just in the third quarter alone gets a reduction from q2 by the end of this year and then another by the middle of next year and one of the things we tried to highlight all the time in this is were very dynamic so were continually looking at the most efficient way to really do those two objectives of protecting capital and maximizing and stabilizing nim so well always make adjustments here as we deem it most efficient an example of that we just did another billion of forwardstarting receivers just in the early part of this quarter that are really starting out into the second half of thatll just continue to drive asset sensitivity lower at the time we really want it so were always doing this really primarily at this point the game plan visavis asset sensitivity is gradually allow the payfixed swaptions to reduce to expire put on more forwardstarting receivers when we see nice opportunities in the market to do that gradually lengthen the duration in our us treasury securities portfolio and really optimize the funding mix for lower structurally fixed funding more structurally variable funding and optimize lower levels of that cash and so those are really the components that drive the overall reduction in asset sensitivity sean sorahan q analyst evercore group llc perfect thank you
