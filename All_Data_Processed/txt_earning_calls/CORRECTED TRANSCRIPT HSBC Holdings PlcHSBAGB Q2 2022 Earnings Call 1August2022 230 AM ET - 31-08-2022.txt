holdings plc thank you mark and good afternoon to everyone in hong kong its great to be here to present our halfyear results and good morning to everyone in london before i turn to progress against our strategy a brief reminder of the context as mark said our purpose as an organization is opening up a world of opportunity these words are a product of extensive consultation with our customers our colleagues about who we are and what we do and i strongly believe that our strength as a global institution comes from our ability to connect the major trading blocks of the world i will come back to the value of our connectivity and strategy later on the next slide sets out the key points that were going to cover in our presentation today first weve had another strong performance in the second quarter im pleased that reported revenue grew by on last years second quarter and was up on an adjusted basis adjusted profits before tax were up on the same period last year and continued strong cost control led to positive adjusted jaws of second weve made good progress with our transformation program if you look back a few years ago we had lossmaking businesses in the us and europe and capital was being used inefficiently we have structurally repositioned our portfolio of businesses and our operating model for higher returns the two most material adjustments in our portfolio have been the exit and wind down of nonstrategic assets and clients in the us and europe and the strong impetus behind organic and inorganic growth in asia especially in wealth and personal banking this reposition effect is starting to pay off in terms of growth and returns as these results show third its the benefit of transformation and the tailwinds from higher interest rates that allow me to announce some ambitious new targets and underpinning guidance even against the challenging economic backdrop after delivering an annualized return on tangible equity of in the first half we are confident of delivering at least from onwards this would represent our best financial performance for a decade finally as a result we are providing more specific guidance of a dividend payout ratio for and we understand and appreciate the importance of dividends to all our shareholders so we will aim to restore the dividend to precovid levels as soon as possible we also intend to revert to quarterly dividends in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 let me now walk you through the progress weve made in the first half of this year in transforming the bank in asia wealth our investments over the past few years are gaining traction weve made a series of bolton acquisitions to accelerate our progress in the first half we completed the acquisition of axa singapore and we remain on track to complete the acquisition of lt investment management in india and in mainland china we continue to build momentum on the back of new licenses and regulatory approvals gained since the start of of which were in the first six months of this year weve got strong revenue momentum across all of our businesses with of the adjusted revenue growth in the first half after turning the corner on revenue back in normalizing interest rates give us confidence in the returns trajectory for the coming years as we will explain later we have also got good cost control with adjusted cost stable in the first half despite inflation and higher spending on technology we had an annualized return on tangible equity in the first half of we have now made cumulative rwa saves of billion and remain on track to exceed billion as we continue to exit assets and clients that do not add value to our international proposition our cet1 ratio was and we aim to manage back to within our target range to during the first half of our capital allocation to growth opportunities in asia and wealth and personal banking also showed good progress we have a strong focus across our network today when you combine exiting unprofitable businesses and underproductive rwas with tighter costs and an impetus for growth you get much better geographic performance with every region profitable in the first half one of the standout performers was the hsbc uk which contributed billion of adjusted profits up on the first half of last year many of you heard about the fantastic job that ian stuart and the uk team are doing at the recent investor day if not please do look at the materials on the website looking forward our transformation also means we can expect the current rate cycle to bring higher returns than previous rates cycles because we have more liquidity less risk and much higher operating leverage the level of surplus deposits we hold means were very well positioned to benefit as higher rates kick in we also now have less risk in our two key books the retail unsecured loan book and the sme lending book we have around billion of business banking deposits in hong kong and around billion of business banking deposits in the uk at very low ad ratios and we have outperformed our peers on cost management in recent years the next few slides cover our four strategic pillars starting with a focus on our strengths our marketleading commercial banking franchise had a very strong first half revenue was up on last year within that it was particularly promising that there was fee income growth of more than trade revenue in commercial banking increased by nearly million or driven by a increase in average trade balances as clients trusted us to help them navigate supply chain shifts glcm was up with a strong benefit from interest rates normalizing and by geography every region performs strongly revenues were up in the uk up in hong kong up in the rest of asia and up in the rest of the world in wealth and personal banking the impacts of the transformation i described is particularly evident net new invested assets in wealth grew by in the first half in asia we achieved significantly more positive dollar growth than was reported recently by our european wealth management peers and it was great to see the value of new business in our asia insurance franchise grow by all despite adverse market conditions revenue in wealth and personal banking was stable but excluding market impacts and a gain on pricing updates on policyholders funds it was up by personal banking had a very strong half lending balances hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 were up driven by a strong our uk mortgages performance and looking at revenue by geography excluding market impacts and the insurance gain the uk was up mexico was up while hong kong remained resilient down only despite the impact of covid restrictions all of this underlines the way we structurally repositioned the business we should now get the benefit of normalizing rates on top of that global banking and markets also performed very well in the first half reflecting our differentiated and diversified business model strong revenue performances in transaction banking and our markets business were driven by rate rises and continued good levels of client activity collaboration between global banking and markets and commercial banking is a priority so i was particularly pleased to see these collaboration revenues increase by back in february i talked about the proportion of global banking and markets client business booked in the east but originated in europe and the americas in the first half this revenue grew by around on the same period last year underlying the strength of our connected franchise we will continue to invest in coverage and build share in connecting capital and trade flows between the worlds major economic blocks digitizing hsbc continues to improve the client experience and make our processes more efficient weve continued to raise our spending on technology with more than half spent on change the bank initiatives to drive growth and efficiencies this is in spite of the commitment to keep our overall costs stable in weve more than doubled the proportion of our agile workforce over the past year which we expect to translate into a much faster release frequency for new features and propositions our cloud adoption across public and private cloud continue to increase beyond with an ambition to go much further and across trade hsbcnet and retail mobile penetration levels and volumes increased materially with ambitions to grow them even further the next slide covers our last two strategic pillars first were continuing to build a dynamic and inclusive culture we remain on track to achieve our revised target of of senior leadership roles filled by women by the total number of hours spent by colleagues learning about sustainability digital and data increased sevenfold reflecting the increased priority placed on future skills and to give you an example of how were opening up a world of opportunity for our people were rolling out a talent marketplace which uses ai to match colleagues with shortterm projects and learning based on their skills and ambitions then on transition to net zero the amount of sustainable financing and investment that we provided and facilitated were stable on the first half of last year despite the overall market for green social and sustainability and sustainabilitylinked bonds being down in the first half the overall amount of sustainable finance and investment provided and facilitated since the start of now stands at more than billion well on our way towards our target of up to trillion by the next slide shows why were confident of keeping adjusted costs stable in and our ambition is to keep cost growth to around in despite strong inflation headwinds it comes down to three things first good cost discipline across the whole group second our efficiency levers were reducing the global real estate footprint reducing our global retail infrastructure using more automation and reducing our operations head count were still only partway through these journeys with an ambition to achieve even greater savings finally we will continue to see the impact of our current transformation programs into next year the flowthrough benefits into are also a big component and will be an important help to offset inflation this brings me to expectations for the rest of and ive explained how weve structurally repositioned the business to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 achieve higher returns once rates normalize despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment were expecting at least billion of net interest income in which is a significant uplift on the billionplus we expected in were aiming to keep cost growth at around in which we fully expect to be able to do for the reasons ive explained given all of this we are materially upgrading our returns guidance we are confident of achieving a return on tangible equity of at least from onwards as a result we are also providing more specific guidance of a dividend payout ratio for and we aim to restore the dividend to precovid levels as soon as possible and we will also revert to quarterly dividend from onwards ill speak to a few more slides at the end but let me now hand over to ewen to take you through the numbers in detail ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all as noel and mark have said its really great to be in hong kong for these results we had another strong quarter reported pretax profits of billion while down on last years second quarter this marks a strong core operating performance compared to the second quarter of last year adjusted revenues were up including net interest income up with operating expenses flat we had positive jaws adjusted pretax profits were up and profits attributable to ordinary shareholders were up credit conditions remained benign in the quarter ecls were million net charge compared with a net release last year we benefited from a billion deferred tax asset credit in the quarter reflecting a recognition of broughtforward tax losses in the uk given the improved profitability outlook we now expect effective tax rate of around reverting to a more normalized effective tax rate of around in to remind you for dividend modeling purposes please exclude the dta gain and the french loss on disposal being noncash significant items but include the billion of cost to achieve we expect to spend this year and other significant items our core tier ratio was our tangible net asset value per share was down on the first quarter mainly due to fx impacts but also to the fourth quarter dividend payment and weve announced an interim dividend of per share up on the first half of on the next slide there was a strong adjusted revenue performance across all our global businesses wealth and personal banking revenues were up overall and up if you exclude million of adverse market impacts and insurance underlying this personal banking had a strong quarter revenues up reflecting both rate rises and balance sheet growth commercial banking was up with growth across all core products due to improved margins and balance sheet growth and revenues driven by collaboration with global banking and markets global banking and markets revenues were up mainly due to global markets and security services and global liquidity and cash management net fee income was down the decline in fees from wealth and investment banking was partly offset by the million increase in global liquidity and cash management and trade fees underlying the benefit of our diversified business model hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 on slide net interest income was billion up against last years second quarter on an adjusted basis on rates the net interest margin was basis points up basis points on the fourth quarter and up basis points compared with the fourth quarter last year as higher asset yields more than offset increased liability costs and on volumes we had underlying loan growth in the quarter of annualized but we saw a decline in average interest earning assets due to fx based upon current fx on the consensus rates outlook we now expect net interest income of at least billion for and at least billion in as we return to a more normalized rates environment on the next slide we provide some buildup to our net interest income forecasts on the rates assumptions as i said our forecast today are based on current fx rates and the current consensus rates outlook as you know with low passthrough rates at the moment but we expect this to increase going into on volumes were forecasting midsingledigit loan growth in turning to slide we reported a net charge of million of ecls in the quarter or basis points this included a further million relating to our mainland china commercial real estate portfolio outside of this one specific portfolio the overall quality of our book remains good stage loans as a percentage of total loans remained stable at around at this stage were not seeing signs of portfolio stress across our key early warning indicators and defaults in july remains low but we continue to monitor the situation closely while the firsthalf ecl charge was only basis points we continue to expect ecls to normalize towards basis points of average loans for the full year with the core driver of this the risk of further deterioration in forward economic guidance rather than any sharp upturn in stage losses turning to the next slide second quarter operating expenses were stable versus the same period last year as cost savings and reduction in accrued variable pay offset the continued increased investment in technology and growth we made a further million of cost program savings during the second quarter with an associated cost to achieve of million as noel said we remain on track for stable adjusted operating expenses this year assuming fx remains at june levels for the remainder of that would be around billion of operating expenses were also on track to achieve the top end of our threeyear billion to billion cost savings target and now expect to see a further billion of cost savings from this program flow through to which will be a material mitigant against the higher inflation were seeing as part of this cost program weve now spent billion of our billion cost to achieve budget that ends in the fourth quarter we still expect to spend the remaining billion during the second half of this year for despite the inflationary trends were seeing were still aiming for cost growth of around the environment is highly volatile but we do not intend to allow the yield curve to weaken our commitment to cost discipline turning to capital on slide our core tier ratio was down basis points on the first quarter this included underlying riskweighted asset movements from lending growth and data and methodology enhancements posttax fair value losses through other comprehensive income as interest rate rose and increased threshold deductions as core tier capital fell we expect our core tier ratio to fall further during the third quarter this includes the announced sale of our french retail banking operations which based on current fx rates is expected to have an impact of around basis points we expect core tier to recover materially in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 the fourth quarter back towards given additional capital management actions were now taking and then be back within our to target range during the first half of so in summary this was a strong quarter were firmly on track to achieve significantly improved operating performance returns and distributions from onwards with interest rates rapidly normalizing and a post covid recovery in most markets were seeing strong revenue growth up on a year ago with continued cost discipline weve achieved a operating jaws this quarter while not complacent the experience of our credit portfolio remains benign based upon the normalization of interest rates with at least billion of net interest income in and the continued core operating performance improvement were driving were raising our expectations for and beyond our return on tangible equity of at least and on the back of this we expect to see a material uplift in distributions from onwards with that back to noel for a few closing comments noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you ewen id like to end with a few slides before qa when we began to accelerate our strategy in february one of our four strategic pillars was to focus on our strengths as you have seen from the material today and throughout our history we have no greater strength than our ability to bridge capital and trade flows between the major economic blocks of the world were the worlds leading trade bank one of the largest payments providers globally and one of the largest fx houses in the world and even as trade flows have changed and supply chains have shifted weve taken market share in trade because our network means we can go wherever trade goes we also command a wallet share of wholesale banking client business from europe the middle east and the americas into asia outside of revenue our international model has also started delivering synergies in our cost base particularly through digitization where we can build ones deploy globally at much lower costs and there are also capital and funding synergies through the greater diversification of our portfolio and the interconnectivity within it in the past investors could not fully assess all that value because parts of our portfolio drag down the overall returns below the cost of capital so the work we have done over the past few years to tightly control costs reduce capital allocated to lowreturn domesticorientated businesses and the increased investment in higher growth higher return geographies in asia and in businesses such as wealth will allow us to demonstrate the value of our international strategy much more clearly as is evident in our forward guidance of at least returns in and beyond international connectivity is core to our entire value proposition from clients to employees and has contributed to our improved returns of our wholesale client business is booked crossborder and a large proportion of the revenue is booked domestically for wholesale clients comes to us because of the business we do for those clients overseas and we will continue to grow that number similarly in wealth and personal banking international is the most attractive and fastestgrowing segment a product like global money and our wealth platforms which are some of our highest return propositions are specifically designed to capitalize on our international connectivity for our retail and wealth customers you will continue to see more propositions from us in this space and thats because the average international customer revenue is around double the average domesticonly customer hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 in addition in a highly competitive talent marketplace especially in asia our internationalism is core to our employee value proposition and how our colleagues think about us there has been a debate recently about our international model and specifically whether alternative structural options would create more value for our shareholders as you would expect we have considered many of these options over recent years more recently we have updated our analysis with the benefit of independent thirdparty financial and legal advice it has been our judgment that alternative structural options will not deliver increased value for shareholders rather they would have a material negative impact on value and our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to get to higher returns and dividends we all want to see when considering different structural options for the bank we need to make judgements on a range of factors which we think would materially impact valuation outcomes clearly the primary factor is about disruption too and the potential loss of the international synergies i just highlighted but its not only about synergies there are significant cost and execution risk that would need to be considered for any alternative structural option past experience in the market as evidenced by carving out a relatively small european bank in a single market can take more than billion and even then has a high risk of failure so you can understand the risks of standing up separate entities for a franchise of our size i wont go through all the points on the slide suffice to say the costs are material there would be significant execution risk over a three to five year period when clients employees and shareholders would all be distracted and impacted and there are ph obvious day one risks around capital distribution and client exits another point that comes up with investors in this discussion is our geopolitical positioning as a global bank we engage and maintain strong relationships with governments and regulators around the world our international role our importance to global trade and our homes in london and hong kong underpin our relationships in both hemispheres and our customers have trusted us for years to help them to navigate the world as it has changed i am putting the factors that we consider when assessing alternative strategies in the public domain so all our shareholders can understand the value of our international structure and our strategy so in summary weve explained today how our strategy will generate significant value for our shareholders we remain focused on our strengths of which international connectivity is at the top our uk and hong kong franchises are performing very well and we are shifting capital to areas with the strongest returns were managing cost tightly and we expect at least billion of net interest income next year as rates normalize were simplifying and digitizing the bank we are engaging and will continue to engage with all our shareholders we share their desire for improved returns and understand the importance of dividends to them we think the best and safest way to improve returns is to focus on our strategy which we are confident will deliver a return on tangible equity of at least from and materially increase distributions with that can we please open up for questions operator thank you mr quinn operator instructions at this point well hand the call over to mr richard oconnor wholl host the qa over to you sir richard oconnor headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 thank you operator well take most of the questions from the audio lines today we have a few analysts and investors in hong kong who indiscernible from the lines so ill see if anybody raises their hands and we got a microphone to come around and hopefully get some questions from hong kong can i just ask everybody to limit themselves as normal to two questions but with that operator well go straight to the first question please question and answer section operator thank you our first question is from raul sinha from jpmorgan your line is open sir raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning everybody my name is raul sinha from jpmorgan ive got two one on capital and one on strategy please on capital when we look at indiscernible i was just wondering if you could talk about the indiscernible from a timing perspective and then the second one is strategy indiscernible i was wondering if you might be able to shed a little bit more color in terms of multiple indiscernible just to give a sense of the indiscernible thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you ill ask ewen to take both of those questions do with capital first and then your questions around cost of executing alternative strategies ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah raul the line wasnt perfectly clear so ill do my best on capital i think the first part of it was sort of understanding the moving parts on the rebuild of capital yeah from first half the obviously weve given you the ma impacts that we expect in q3 in addition to that we are taking probably about basis points to basis points of incremental capital actions that we previously havent talked about with the market which you should expect to come through in the second half of this year we also remember that under the bank of england pra rules we have to accrue dividends at the top end of our to payout ratio so in the first half effectively the core tier ratio is understated because of that accrual and theres a catchup that youll see in q4 so we do think that well trough next quarter are a bit below where we are well be back close to by full year well be back within range to during the first half of next year and then your question on buybacks are then links into that which is you should not expect us to be doing buybacks until were back within our core tier range of to which yeah you can imply from that will be more backend loaded next year as a result noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 thank you and just before i get to the detail on or go to the specific that you asked just on the alternative structural options i think what youve got to take into account is the combination of impacts there is a negative impacts on the revenue synergies that weve identified in the paper theres a negative impact on some of the funding and capital synergies that exist in the group thats welldiversified theres a negative impact on the cost of executing which are oneoff costs and then there are some ongoing cost impacts in terms of the funding cost of a less diversified group split into two will be higher than the funding cost of a diversified group and then there are some ongoing running costs that youd incur i think its the totality of that that youve got to look at and not any one item and there are many judgment calls to make in that equation but whatever way you balance those judgment calls we believe that the safest and fastest route to generate increased dividends and increased returns is the strategy that were pursuing wed given you schedules in the pack and in the appendix to help you understand some of the factors that need to be considered so i dont think theres any one cost item that i think is more relevant than the other ph bridge of the package and then you got high execution risk because something of that complex nature can take three years to five years with uncertain outcome for regulatory approval and for investor approval ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean just to give a bit more color around some of the numbers raul i mean as noel said if you just look at the sort of oneoff cost associated with setting up a structure if you were to have a separately listed asian subsidiary you would have to be able to demonstrate that you had standalone it systems which would probably take three years to five years to construct would run into the probably billions of dollars to be able to do that you have a billion mrel stack currently sitting in our asian subsidiary all of which is downstream from the parent again they would be a three to fiveyear issuance program required to reissue all of that mrel out to the public markets and effectively do a liability management exercise on that excess mrel that was sitting at the group and then you would have potential tax impacts because of triggering capital gains indiscernible implications as you did the restructuring and other oneoff costs associated with effectively recreating a stand alone business here here being hong kong where i am today and then you go into the ongoing dyssynergies for example in the slides weve showed you that of the billion of wholesale revenues of them relate to international customers so you can run your own math somewhat portion of that billion would be at risk but it wouldnt be material you would have to effectively duplicate corporate functions and it run costs that we get global synergies on today you would lose group purchasing power benefits that we get today we think you would have to operate our asian business at a higher core tier ratio as a standalone business because it wouldnt benefit from the group support that it gets today that the hkma does take into account theres about billion of at1 tier tier capital sitting in the rest of the group we think if you would have break out the asian subsidiary theres a significant risk that the rest of the group would derate from a ratings perspective one notch downgrade on that billion we think is a 25basispoint to 50basispoint impact per annum and our uk business holding company today has a number of tax benefits the uk has far better withholding tax arrangements with the rest of the world compared to hong kong and we also get a tax shield on our uk headquarter costs in the uk and then you go into the complexity of execution all of the timelines point to three to five years in that three to five years we would have to prioritize it change in respect of the separation rather than it change in respect of the core business we need reg approval in about jurisdictions there would be questions around indexation were currently fully indexed in both markets yeah us dollar clearing we dont think would be available to the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 asian subsidiary and we dont think that we would readily be able to get a dollar clearing license for the asian subsidiary as weve seen with others so as noel says i think when you package all of that up in terms of cost to implement complexity to implement and ongoing to synergies we just really struggle to come up with any form of value case that we could put in front of shareholders richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay next question please raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you operator thank you our next question is from manus costello from autonomous your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hi guys thank you very much for the long list of negatives with regards to the breakup costs i wondered if in the spirit of indiscernible considerations in the public domain you could discuss what on the other side of the ledger you could be upside potentially of a breakup do you think its possible that you could see faster growth indiscernible do you think that you can make better valuation attached to them could you just explain indiscernible noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc manus thank you i mean i think were already seeing strong growth from the execution of the current strategy were already very focused on the growth opportunities in asia you can see that in hong kong our commercial banking business has had very strong growth here in hong kong and globally trade business is up of the revenue so i think to be honest manus weve already factored in strong growth opportunities in asia and were deploying more and more capital into asia so i think for us weve already got that growth scenario factored into the current plan and then your second point was ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah around rerating noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 rerating manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp indiscernible noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look i mean just to complete yeah can you imagine a different business plan for asia yes you could manus but would have to work through all those capital funding liquidity implications and risk appetite implications of that theres been some suggestions that we could accelerate growth in some areas but that would come with a changed risk appetite and therefore changed capital funding and liquidity implications that weve started to work through but again we dont we think the overall net dyssynergies outweigh any of those positive synergies yes you could speculate that there could be a rerating of the asian business if it was separated out equally we think there would be a derating of the rest of the world so when weve looked those two together we havent been able to convince ourselves that theres some kind of magic structural alternative that delivers a rerating for the overall group noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you richard richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah next question please operator thank you our next question is from omar keenan from credit suisse your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi omar omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning everybody thank you for taking the questions congratulations on a good set of numbers its good to see jaws kind of improve so strongly ive got two questions please so my first question is on the analysis of the strategic options and i wanted to ask you is there anything that youve decided to do that is incremental to the strategy and it becomes a process that youve gone through in the past couple of months and what i can see is that cost efficiencies have moved to the upper end of the range hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 and youre talking about basis points to basis points of additional capital actions so i was hoping you could add a little bit more color specifically on those two points indiscernible and my second question is on deposit beta so one of your peers indiscernible migration from current and savings accounts to time deposits i was hoping you could give us some updates on how youre thinking about the competitive environment in deposits as we go forward thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc on your first point ill just answer that and ill pass to ewen for the second point i mean were very determined to improve the performance of the business and we take all feedback ph this is the business hasnt performed well over the past years wed say thats indiscernible and have done and are very committed to trying to drive out capital efficiency into the business so we constantly look at part of the portfolio that are strategically less important and are underperforming and were determined to continue to drive out efficiency into the capital allocation of the business on the specific point of the additional capital management actions were taking i think thats in response to the cet1 impact of the marktomarket on the treasury book thats in addition to mitigate the downturn in the cet1 as a consequence of that but were confident that the capital build thats coming from higher profitability will start to reboot cet1 towards the end of this year and into next year but those capital management actions are not in response to structural considerations theyre more in response to nearterm capital management activities those actions are tactically important and right things to do but theyre not strategically damaging to the franchise of the bank where were not having to turn off good strategic growth were able to take those actions whilst pursuing our strategy indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc what you can see in the results today is an attempt by us to be clearer on what the strategy is so giving you more disclosure around the international connectivity of the business clarifying what we thought was a significant gap to our internal views on dividend potential for and beyond versus where consensus was so what weve tried to do is if you want clarify the strategy a lot clearer that were pursuing look on deposit betas we are seeing currently very little migration to time deposit so far remember that actually a significant part of our book is actually not time deposits but i think if you look at previous cycles you would expect migration to occur as interest rates continue to arise so yeah as weve said previously the modeling that weve done in the interest rate sensitivity is based on a passthrough rate were well below that at the moment we do think it will rise from here and part of the reason of the rise is because of migration omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay next next well take one more question from the lines and well just check in with hong kong and see if theres any live questions next question please operator thank you our next question is from aman rakkar from barclays the line is now open aman rakkar q analyst barclays investment bank good morning good afternoon noel ewen richard noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc afternoon aman rakkar q analyst barclays investment bank indiscernible firstly on your net interest income guidance so thank you so much for giving us the guidance billion and i note the rate assumptions that youre making behind that i think are laid out on slide ie in line with market and price policy rates i guess theres a pretty healthy debate amongst investors when i speak to them as to whether we actually get to those level of interest rates and if they need to get cut again indiscernible so just interested in your thoughts around to what extent is the indiscernible as part of the forward curve at the moment what risk would that post to your rote ambitions and do you have levers that you can pull if that billion nii guide at risk say if you didnt quite get to that circa base rate for example and the second question is just around capital i note the actions that youre taking can lift the cet1 ratio back toward target range but that actual target level how are you thinking about that i mean when i compare that to your ph mda theres a pretty ph handsome gap of around basis points towards your target level that feels quite large is there anything that you can do or are hoping for from the regulator to try and get that target level down thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you ill ask ewen to answer both of those questions ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on the nii guidance a couple of things i mean you should assume that yeah weve got a bit of indiscernible in there when were guiding to at least billion secondly i think remember as interest rate continue to rise deposit betas will continue to rise so if you dont get that final hedge on interest rates at the back end then were already modeling very high deposit betas at that time so the implicit impact on the net interest income is a lot lower than what you may think hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 so weve run various scenarios and are comfortable based on a range of scenarios at the moment that well be able to deliver billion but obviously its a very material change in rates we will reassess that and weve given you the interest rate sensitivity so you can run your own numbers on capital yeah look i think there is a debate at the back end of and whether we can adjust our core tier ratio if you think about where weve been in the past weve been making a very big investment internally into our stress testing capabilities into our recovery and resolution capabilities which you dont see from the outside we also didnt have the returns in the past the combination of the returns that we had and that very high payout ratio that we had in the past we just didnt have the same capital flexibility that we expect to have from onwards so i think its important before we engage the regulators in that discussion that we get back within the range but i think once were back in the range there should be some model stability to adjust down where were targeting on core tier but i would say thats back end of for discussion richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks indiscernible can we have one question from hong kong indiscernible the mic and give your name and institution please thank you gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thanks for taking the question this is gurpreet with goldman congratulations on a good set of numbers i have two quick questions please first is on the prime rate in hong kong and then the mortgage gap that should effectively be hitting all the mortgage borrowers starting next month if im not mistaken so what could be the efforts to that prime minus and hence to lift the effective gap for the mortgage borrowers and how much of that can we do before we see kind of deposit migration as ewen you have talked about and then we run into that question of raising the prime interest rates and then once they are raised will it be symmetrical with the savings deposit rate or does it do asymmetrical thats the first question sorry for being a lengthy one on this one and then second is simple on the credit cost so as of now i see china cre still contributing nearly of the total provisions at some point during this year or early next year its going to roll off i mean china is going to isnt go we arent going to book cre losses till eternity right and so i still see the guidance on the second half of basis points versus first half so how much of the typical hallmark hsbc conservatism goes into that thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ill take that as a compliment traditional hsbc conservatism i think thats something good to be accused of let me deal with the chinese cre and then ill ask ewen to deal with the prime rate and the mortgage cap listen the ecl charge in the first six months is a positive outcome and but the economy is still uncertain so i think it would be unwise of us at the halfyear stage to start factoring in the firsthalf performance as a trend for the full year and therefore it is appropriate to guide to a higher second half charge given the level of uncertainty and i think well update the q3 and clearly well know the answer in q4 but itd be unwise to think that the first half trend is something that can roll forward into the second half our expectation at the moment is the forward economic guidance will probably continue to worsen and therefore theres more likely to be stage and stage hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 provisions in the second half of the year rather than necessarily us having a line of sight to stage so if that build of ecl in the second half i think is going to be more around stage and stage as economic forecasts continue to deteriorate and forward economic guidance is factored in so that would be the view on the ecl but happy to be conservative at this stage ewen do you want to cover prime rate ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc are you sure you dont want to cover that noel noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc no i dont ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean just to add on ecls we havent said theyre going to be basis points in the second half we said that theyre trending towards a yearly average of basis points so that would be the highest they we would expect them to be in the second half on the prime rate not for everyone in the room here in hong kong will understands this but for everyone whos not in hong kong and yeah the mortgage market here is typically priced of onemonth hibor plus the spread the borrowers also have an option to shift from that rate to whats called the best lending rate minus margin today those two rates are broadly in line with each other maybe even i would say most of our mortgage brokers tipping into the latter ie the best lending rate minus margin provides a lower rate to customers than onemonth hibor plus the spread were charging them the and that rate is set daily and calculated daily and the customer doesnt need to do anything it just happens automatically that they switch from one rate to the other today about of our portfolio is subject to the mortgage cap but i would say that given movements in the last month or so thats likely to trend materially higher to most of the portfolio over the next couple of months look im clearly not going to sit here and give guidance on what were going to do with the best lending rate historically going back i think for years the best lending rate has moved in line with the best savings rate so we have seen slightly lower margins in the past but no discounts being applied to the base lending rate thats obviously one tool we have if we were to change the best lending rate and the best savings rate followed in tandem that would be economically worse for us given that we have a larger deposit surplus and would see a bigger hit on higher savings rates than the benefit wed get from raising the lending rate but clearly this is all subject to competition and were not going to discuss it on a public call richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay thanks ill come back to hong kong towards the end well go back to the audio lines next question operator please hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 operator thank you our next question is from andrew coombs from citi your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hey andy andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd hi there good morning two questions please the first if you could clarify the billion and the billion net interest income guidance that you gave can you just provide a bit more detail on what you are assuming on the indiscernible you talked about indiscernible rate hike cycles so if you could just clarify what indiscernible you have assumed to get to that billion and billion and my second question is sort of the disconnect between average interestearning asset and loan growth if you look at the quarter on constant currency basis loans are up average interestearning asset is down so whats driven the disconnect and given your guidance for next year of the midsingledigit loan growth do you think though the average interestearning assets will reconnect with the loan growth next year thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on the second one andy its just average interestearning assets are not fx adjusted so if you talk to our research team afterwards theyll be able to give you a sort of fxadjusted average interestearning asset richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah also low some lower liquidity balances in the quarter as well ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on nii guidance you know i hate giving nii guidance so i thought i was doing well today to give it but were not going to go on and get go on and give you deposit beta assumptions as part of that look weve said through the cycle we expected to be basis points weve said that deposit betas so far i think have been in the so you should assume that theres a material rampup in deposit betas as rates go higher from here andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd okay on next year we should think the average interestearning assets should be more aligned with loan growth ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd ph thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks andy next question operator please operator thank you our next question is from martin leitgeb from goldman sachs your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning first of all indiscernible comment on the good set of numbers today im just wondering first question on structural hedging and im just wondering if you indiscernible change towards deployment of some more structural hedging or maturity transformation or however you want to call it in geographies outside of the uk in order to maybe transform some of the deposits into kind of more medium term maturities and to stabilize nii ph moving forward forward and can you just update us on where you are with structural hedging and if indiscernible capacity to do more and secondly you called out the stellar performance of the uk i was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on whats precisely driving that strength thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on structural hedging martin i mean look firstly the nature of our book was here in hong kong where its different difficult to extend if not impossible to extend duration given the nature of the deposit base and the asset base here we cant buy longevity in hong kong dollars and secondly on the asset side the trade book is very shortdated too so we do typically have more interest rate sensitivity than most of our peers having said that we relative to what we could do we are structurally under hedged we have for example started to as some of the hold to collect and sell portfolio is beginning to mature weve materially increased the hold to collect portfolio during the quarter and you should expect that to continue so i think we will slowly increase the level of structural hedging overall in the bank over time to reduce some of the interest rate sensitivity but given the nature of the balance sheet i think you should assume that we will continue to have higher interest rate sensitivity than peers even after weve done that on the outperformance of the uk business which i think was the second question look i mean i just think ian stuart and team are doing a really really good job at the moment theyve are taking very assertive actions against their cost structure i think costs were down q2onq2 weve always told you that were structurally underweight in some segments like mortgages we had mortgage growth yearonyear in q2 the commercial business is going well at the moment in the uk postbrexit hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 we are the only bank in the uk of any size that can really deliver an international network to customers and as customers change the nature of their international businesses were ideally placed to service that so look i and obviously credit conditions in the uk at least for us continue to remain relatively benign noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc just another statistic on the uk yeartodate the uk business has helped more than overseas customers purchase or refinance properties in the uk in the first six months of this year and then on the other side of the equation im really pleased to say that the uk business has offered great support theyve helped more than ukrainian settlers to the uk open a bank account with us so i think what youre looking at is a broad base of activity in the digital world the uk has now onboarded clients onto hsbc kinetic which is a fully mobile digital proposition for smes full range of product suite there not just the account ph home but cards lending overdraft savings accounts and theyve onboarded of those customers have been onboarded within hours and the customer satisfaction is currently sitting at so i think youve got a broad base of actions that ian and the team have taken in the uk costs revenue generation products enhancements digitization the international clients and the domestic clients and i think theres a lot of good work being done there and its starting to pay dividend richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc another question from the audio line please operator thank you our next question is from guy stebbings from bnp your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi guy noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi guy guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hi morning morning afternoon everyone and thanks for the questions the first was just on capital actions and if you could elaborate on what indiscernible in the second half from those ph sort of early revenue hit indiscernible and sort of what informs taking those actions now indiscernible to build the capital naturally and get back to ph target a little bit more indiscernible especially given that the capital hit is in part ratedriven which is pl beneficial in time ultimately net positive just wondered indiscernible quickly do a buyback next year indiscernible dividends indiscernible or anything else and the third question was on rate thanks for all the color with the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 guidance indiscernible i just wondered given where the market implied path is now where that the ph shift any further out would you still see that as net beneficial to the bottom line given caps on client given deposit mix given with regard to the technical implications for impairments ph growth et cetera so i just wondered how much incrementally beneficial youd still see rate rises indiscernible thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on capital actions that mainly benefit rwas they it will have a some but modest impact on the pl but we do think when we think about the balance of considerations of heading into probably tougher economic conditions in the right thing for us to do is to accelerate our capital ratios to being back within target so were happy to accept some impact on income in order to achieve that but we do think that the return analysis that were running on those incremental actions makes sense and were not doing anything that goes into what id describe as franchise impairment impairing actions on nii i think it is market dependent so here in hong kong theres probably very little benefit that we would derive from interest rates going higher than whats implied in forward curves at the moment but i think in other markets definitely there would be value and i still think that were structurally geared to if you think about the last couple of years in net interest income was slightly under billion so over two years were generating an extra billion of net interest income which more than offsets any incremental ecl costs we could see or higher costs because of inflationary issues so i still think that theres some ways to run even based on forward curves before you start seeing impairments materially tick up i think the other thing thats important to remember guy for us and it probably applies to other banks but our customer base on the retail side is mainly affluent theyve had their savings rates go up materially during covid so theyre all sitting quite liquid with good cash reserves at the moment youve also weve seen credit card spending pick up but people are still mainly rolling their credit card balances so we dont have any particular credit difficult credit exposure on the retail side that i would call out with the customers sitting with good cash balances and now on the mainstream corporate side the global corporate sector has effectively been deleveraging for years in most parts of the world corporate loan growth has been well below gdp nominal gdp growth so again corporate balance sheets are unusually healthy for what would be at this point in a cycle facing a downturn yeah so for all those reasons i think if interest rates went higher other than hong kong i think we would sort of view that as a positive for us richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc just checking any further questions in hong kong appears to be none so i think we have time for one more question from the audio lines and then well hand back to noel to sum up so last question from the audio lines please operator thank you our last question is from tom rayner from numis your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 hi tom noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd thank you hi hi everyone ph it seems youre being so charitable and youre giving specific guidance on indiscernible net interest income costs returns i could possibly back out what youre thinking on noninterest income but just wondering if you could give us any color on what youre thinking in terms of the main drivers and covid restrictions indiscernible whats going on in capital markets chinese gdp all those things ph called but seems to be the only missing piece of the pl we dont have now noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc tom you know how much ewen likes giving guidance on nii now youre asking him to give guidance on nfi as well its ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes tom if my chief accountant was here wed be running dangerously close to giving a profit forecast but the only thing i would say is when you run your calculations for do you think about all of the oneoffs that weve had this year including the negative insurance mcu that wont repeat or shouldnt repeat next year so but im not going to give you anything on nii forecast but nice try tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd ph how about but just color on the trend i mean covid indiscernible noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd indiscernible just more broadly noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think what weve all got to factor in to our future thinking is take here in hong kong there should at some point a rebound in wealth management activity that would drive higher free income there should be at some stage a rebound in capital market activity that should drive higher fees for gbm but its too early at the moment to predict exactly how much of that will come back and when it will come back hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2022 but you could argue if you look at the pl of the retail bank and the wpb for the first six months theyve got revenue growth and what youve found is that the retail banking has driven strong growth from nii but has been subdued on its fee income and then if you can start to get the fee income coming back as economies reboot and wealth management activity reestablishes itself then you should start to see a growth in nii in noninterest income but its too early to predict when that will be and were not going to give guidance on it tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd all right thanks for that noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you well thank you very much for all of your questions and for giving us your time to close with a few comments we are confident of significantly improved value for our shareholders our repositioning of the business is gaining traction our international connectivity remains our greatest strength we have got costs under control and interest rates are normalizing all of this means we are on track for our best financial
