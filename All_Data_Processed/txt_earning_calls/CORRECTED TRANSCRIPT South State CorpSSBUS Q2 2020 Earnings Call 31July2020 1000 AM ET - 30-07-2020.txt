chairman robert r hill jr executive chairman south state corp good morning and thanks for being with us today only days into our merger and much has changed in the world what has not changed is the speed at which we are moving to integrate two strong companies the commitment of our team and our board to the success and the opportunities that lie in front of us while the economic environment has its challenges the prospects for south state are significant south state was built on the principles of soundness profitability and growth technical difficulty in great markets had us wellpositioned for the long term while any quarter with a merger involved is more complex our revenues remain strong our expense plan on track and were able to take a lot of risk off the table as we combine the two loan portfolios while there are certainly industry headwinds that will persist in the near term i believe these challenges also present opportunities for stronger banks to prosper while days is a very short period of time in many ways it feels like these teams have been together for years our team continues to rise to the occasion we are open and honest with each other building trust and excited to be together as one team and focused on the same set of goals i will now turn the call over to john for more insight into our quarter john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you robert good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us this morning i hope you and your families are remaining healthy and safe has been a transformative year for the banking industry as a whole and its been particularly transformative for south state we announced our strategic merger vehicles with centerstate on january at the time we saw an opportunity to build an executive team that can lead our company through the digital transformation over the next decade we also saw an opportunity to combine two of the southeast premier deposit franchises in the best growth markets in the country two months after the merger announcement while we were actively pursuing regulatory and shareholder approval the economy shut down like others we shifted to a workfromhome environment and immediately focused on how we can assist our clients in a time of need the two most powerful levers we could pull was first to be as generous as possible in providing loan payment deferrals for our borrowers and then second to inject as much cash flow stimulus as possible through the ppp loan program the billion of ppp stimulus that south state provided represents about of our billion loan portfolio and the deferrals we offer represents about of our loan portfolio in retrospect im confident that we chose the right strategy to be as generous as possible with shortterm cash flow relief by working nights weekends and the easter holiday our bankers delivered for our clients when they needed us the most and that loyalty will pay dividends for years to come while only about half of the 90day loan payment deferrals have matured through july its encouraging that the request for a second deferral is significantly lower than the first round and less than we originally expected despite the distractions from covid we were able to south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 obtain regulatory and shareholder approval for the merger ahead of schedule and we made the decision to close the transaction on june which was earlier than planned our midquarter close is messier from a financial perspective but we wanted to put the closing in a rearview mirror so that we can move forward with the integration and so we can focus on our clients i would be remiss if i did not pause to recognize and thank our south state leadership team and bankers closing a merger of equals in a stable environment is a very tall order doing it during a pandemic is heroic from the finance and legal team that closed the books in the middle of the quarter right after they completed million subdebt offering through our relationship managers and support teams that process nearly ppp loans the work ethic and professionalism of the south state bankers gives me tremendous confidence in the power of this team and im proud to be on the journey with them will is going to walk through our combined second quarter results but i want to offer my own high level observations most importantly the underlying earnings power of the company is steady and strong to demonstrate the steadiness of the combined company we produced a slide on page of the earnings deck which illustrates the ppnr trend assuming that centerstate and south state were combined over the last year you can see that the ppnr for the second quarter would have been million which is consistent with prior quarters and actually its slightly better than the same quarter last year with the merger closing in the second quarter however there were two highly unusual accounting issues even for those of us that are familiar with merger accounting the first is that with the closing on june the first days of centerstates earnings in the second quarter are not included in the second quarter of south state earnings the missing centerstate earnings for the first days of the quarter would have added million of preprovision net revenue to south state if the merger had occurred on april the second highly unusual item is the million cecl reserve applied to the centerstate acquired loan portfolio this is a result of the new cecl accounting standard that is affectionately known as the double count whereby an acquired loan portfolio not only receives a traditional mark but also simultaneously receives the loan loss provision that runs through the income statement in the quarter that the merger closes now look im not an accountant but it seems to me personally like a beltandsuspenders approach to loan loss reserves the silver lining is that this new accounting approach gives the company a very strong loss absorption capacity and i know ph this isnt gaap accounting but if you add the acquired loan portfolio marks together with the allowance its as if you have a combined loan loss reserve at which is substantially higher than our peers with these two unusual accounting items in the quarter plus the normal mergerrelated expenses the company recorded a net loss of per share on a gaap basis now let me take you back to the normalized view of the quarter as if south state and centerstate had always been combined the combined company produced record revenue driven by mortgage correspondent banking and capital market fees these feebased businesses really shine in this type of economic environment and weve been very intentional over the years to build a balanced business model through the last five years weve built successful fee income businesses that performed well with net interest margins decline in addition to the normal balance sheet businesses that perform well when net interest margins rise this balanced business model is performing exactly as planned both mortgage and correspondent banking enjoyed record revenues and record profitability this quarter even as the nim came under pressure south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 loan growth was down slightly if you exclude the billion of ppp loans and asset quality metrics improved across the board with lower past dues nonaccruals and virtually no net chargeoffs deposit growth boomed during the quarter and the combined balance sheet expanded by more than billion now clearly most of that growth was related to the ppp proceeds and shortterm government stimulus so we anticipate that the balance sheet will shrink over time as the stimulus wears off and finally capital by combining the elevated cecl reserves with the purchase accounting marks plus the million of subdebt that we raised in the second quarter plus a strong and steady ppnr that will get even stronger after we complete the merger cost saves we feel that south state is wellpositioned to move forward despite the headwinds that the industry will experience over the next year will ill turn it over to you william e matthews chief financial officer south state corporation thanks john this was clearly an important quarter for the company with the closing of the merger of equals additionally the size of this merger and the impact of cecl merger accounting created a lot of moving parts when we announced the moe in late january we had not expected to be the first moe of size to receive regulatory approvals and close in but we are and were also the first one postcecl and postpandemic outbreak so were going to attempt to give you information youll find meaningful amidst all the accounting noise associated with the merger closing i want to start by recognizing and thanking our excellent finance team at south state as well as the credit and cecl teams our midmonth closing and the third month of the quarter added a lot of complexity and time pressure and i couldnt be prouder of the work dedication and collegiality exhibited by our team everyone from the reconcilements area to the leaders of the department performed in an exemplary manner not only did we close the merger three weeks before quarter end shortly after completing million subdebt offering but we also completed a conversion of the general ledger system in a merger of the two companies departments and job selection process for all finance and accounting personnel the competency and work ethic of this team gave us confidence to push forward with the june closing and their performance is i think a testament to one of the strengths of this merger that is two great teams of outperformers coming together to form one highperforming team im pleased and proud to be associated with these folks im going to cover the following items this morning the significant moving parts associated with the merger closing that impacted our earnings and our balance sheet this quarter a more significant purchase accounting entries and the resultant loss absorption capacity are results both gaap asreported and operating combined business basis our capital position and an update on our merger efficiency realization items associated with the merger closing first under cecl we placed the credit and rate mark on the centerstate loan portfolio including both pcd loans and nonpcd loans the credit mark on pcd loans resides in the allowance for credit losses but is not includable as tier capital the entire mark on nonpcd loans credit and rate is a contrast that reducing the carrying balance of these loans and it is also not includable as tier capital second cecl also requires us to record a provision for credit losses on the nonpcd loans and this provision expense runs through the income statement in the quarter of closing this is the double count effect as these loans have both the credit mark and an allowance for credit losses because our merger closed june and due to south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 the impact of covid on various economic factors that drives cecl loss estimates we had a relatively high provision expense for acquired centerstate nonpcd loans of million caused by the merger and only three weeks of centerstate operations to help cover that expense third as its true with any merger weve reported a number of mergerrelated costs and expenses including legal counsel investment banking and employee and contract termination amounts that occur in a merger credit marks and loss absorption capacity note that when i speak of ratios of allowance and credit mark coverage im excluding the ppp loans from the denominator due to their likely temporary existence and their sba guarantee to determine our ph pcd loans we had several screening criteria including pass due status credit grades credit scores et cetera and we also categorized any loan on deferral status and the entire lodging portfolio as pcd given covid the total pcd portfolio is approximately billion or roughly of the centerstate loans acquired ill remind you that the definition of pcd is not a problem loan also note that the marks are preliminary and will be finalized in the coming quarters the credit mark or allowance on this billion in pcd loans at quarter end was million or approximately of that portfolio the remaining billion approximately in nonpcd loans again excluding ppp loans received a credit mark of million which is approximately basis points given the screening process for identifying loans to categorize as pcd we believe the nonpcd portfolio to be clean slide shows the total loss absorption capacity on the balance sheet at june million in the allowance which is basis points of loans million of which was at legacy south state another million in the reserve for unfunded commitments which is another basis point of loans and another million in unrecognized discounts on loans ph according to basis points of loans which brings the total to million or approximately of loans as john mentioned while we all see storm clouds on the economic horizon we had another quarter of very low net chargeoffs almost zero for the quarter and past dues continued to be low ending npas were basis points of assets dan is available to answer further questions on credit during the qa section of the call provision expense on the legacy south state portfolio was million bringing the quarter end allowance level to approximately basis points of that portfolio plus another basis points for the reserve for unfunded commitments at legacy south state given the minimal chargeoffs and lack of growth in the quarter the increase in the allowance was attributable to changes in the economic forecasts the other key purchase accounting entry was the core deposit intangible which received the mark of basis points our billion cd book was marked the other direction as these yields were above market at closing date so our cost of these will decline accordingly from approximately basis points to approximately basis points let me now discuss results for the quarter for the quarter we reported a loss of million excluding the million in the provision for credit losses on the acquired nonpcd loans and excluding the million in merger related expenses in the quarter adjusted earnings would have been million or per share the timing of the closing was a primary factor in the loss with only days of income production from legacy centerstate and the impact of the full provision expense on the acquired nonpcd loans as well as the mergerrelated costs our net interest margin with the reduction in rates buildup in liquidity and the sale of about half of the centerstate bond portfolio preclose we saw a margin compression in percentage terms although the production of net interest income and dollars showed less compression south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 loan yields were for the quarter down basis points from q1 total cost of deposits was basis points down basis points from q1 and we saw a nice growth in dda balances we saw compression on securities due to the purchase accounting marks applied on the centerstate bonds and the shrinking of the total portfolio on a combined basis also led to compression our reported net interest margin was tax equivalent down basis points from q1 let me talk for a minute about the underlying financial performance which was strong as john said given the midquarter close and associated merger accounting entries we thought this information on a combined business basis would be useful to you so we have included several slides beginning on page of the presentation these comments are on net basis which are the gaap historical numbers of each company without regard to purchase accounting entries or any efficiencies that may be realized as john noted our ppnr of million was very consistent with the prior four quarters and the ppnr roa of basis points was strong in light of the expanded balance sheet due to ppp and liquidity we had a record combined revenue in q2 up million from the second quarter slide shows how the makeup of the revenue has changed over the last five quarters with noninterest income moving from of total revenue in the yearago quarter to in this quarter providing the countercyclical benefit we expect slide shows the growth in combined noninterest income from million in the yearago quarter to million in this quarter in a quarter with workfromhome and moe and emerging of two mortgage management groups our combined mortgage teams did billion in production which is impressive in a period with these many distractions our net interest margin on a combined business basis was down approximately basis points from q1 with net interest income on that basis down approximately million combined loan growth was billion but loans declined approximately million excluding the ppp loans yeartodate combined loan growth excluding ppp loans is basically flat combined deposit growth was billion or billion excluding brokerage cds noninterest expenses were million for the quarter or million excluding the mergerrelated expenses on a combined business basis for the full quarter it would have been million combined noninterest expenses grew by approximately half of the growth in noninterest income from q1 and approximately of the noninterest income growth from q4 reflecting the strength of the commissionbased businesses during the second quarter we also had increased expenses associated with the pandemic on a combined business basis our efficiency ratio in q2 was up slightly from combined in q1 on capital our ending tce ratio is expansion of the balance sheet through the ppp reduced the ratio by approximately basis points our cet1 was and our total riskbased capital ratio was ending tangible book value per share was up from q1 as i noted we also have solid loss absorption capacity on the balance sheet let me finish by updating you on mergerrelated expenses and cost saves our cost save process is well underway and on target with numerous successful vendor negotiations operating model and staffing templates being constructed by business leads and cost targets for each our core conversion schedule for the middle of the south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 second quarter of giving us ample time to prepare to ensure good execution and we should begin to realize the bulk of the remaining cost saves at that point we will recognize some cost saves in the latter part of this year but most will occur after the conversion through june wed recognized million in mergerrelated expenses we continue to expect to be within our originally announced million total with an estimate of approximately of the remaining amount in the last half of and the remainder occurring in we expect the largest quarter for mergerrelated expenses to be the second quarter of next year when we complete our system conversion so a quarter with a lot of moving parts with strong underlying performance healthy loss absorption capacity and solid credit results thus far ill turn it back to you john john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven all right as a reminder we are conducting this call remotely and i ask that you please direct your question to the appropriate individual youd like to respond this concludes our prepared remarks and i would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question will come from stephen scouten of piper sandler please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning stephen robert r hill jr a executive chairman south state corp good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co so let me start i guess this is a will question primarily im wondering if you could give us an idea just on the impact and excuse me if i missed this the ppp specifically on the nim and maybe some sort of basis point estimate on what the excess liquidity impact is in nim and i guess relative to the that you put in the presentation where you think the nim could normalize longer term whenever that occurs william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 im going to let steve start with that question stephen stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation hey stephen its steve yeah just a couple of points on the nim as were combining the companies let me just first of all remind us that this is a very core deposit funded bank we have million customers checking accounts if you see on page in your deck as will mentioned there was a lot of deposit growth over this past quarter on a combined business basis about billion our checking accounts make up of the deposits and our dda make up so very very core funded of the billion we grew in deposits we have about billion sitting on the balance sheet in just excess liquidity not invested in shortterm funds normally we would probably have somewhere in the billion to billion range so we have about billion to billion more excess than normal and that creates about basis points of pressure on the margin and thats why you see in the deck that will referenced the actual margin dollars didnt decline all that much but the margin percentage did so hopefully thats helpful just to build the bridge on a combined basis we were and a couple of things to maybe keep in mind number one we did do the subdebt offering toward the middle or the end of the quarter that creates a couple of basis points pressure thats not in that also on the fair value accounting that will mentioned around particularly the securities book that portfolio was around for half the securities book we sold half of it in march the other half so that creates another basis points of pressure and then ultimately we did the fair value marks on the loan book of course we already had some discounts on the loan book and just really reloaded that and then of course prepays kind of moved that and then the last piece is just on the ppp program we have a slide on the deck towards the end of the presentation slide that talks about the amount of ppp indiscernible fees that we have at the end of the quarter it was about million and of course depending on when that forgiveness time happens we expect most of that toward the end of the year in the first of next year based on what we know today that will impact margin going forward so i know a lot of moving parts but hopefully youll see the will be adjusted down from a percentage unless when we move back the balance sheet the investments towards the another billion so hopefully thats helpful for you stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and maybe william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation and stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co oh sorry south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation im sorry stephen with respect to the ppp question impact on the margin it really didnt have a very significant impact because we had some fee recognition in the quarter as you see that on slide so the net impact of lower yield on that portfolio in terms of the base rate combined with the fees it really wasnt very impactful to the margin stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great great and then i dont know if you had talked about this plan beforehand but the large ph selling half of the securities portfolio and it looked like maybe there was about million gain on securities there prior to the deal close what was the logic there i guess there was a thought process especially given all the excess liquidity in the systems im just surprised you would sell an earning asset there stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation sure stephen this is steve under fair value accounting rules we have to mark those securities to market so effectively you get those yields going forward and when we completed the merger those security yields were in the range so we just decided to put some on the shelf and lets see how we progressed through the ppp and other things just to be conservative so that we didnt invest all of our securities or half the security book in at and well just have to layer that back in over time stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co all right got it yeah thats helpful william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation and if you think about it stephen theres some great bonds that we sold but there were great bonds closer to par we dont like them as much with the kind of premium handle were going to have on them because as steve said youre effectively buying them at acquisition date so that played into our thinking as well stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect very helpful and then just one last thing from me i guess and maybe this a steve question as well but it looks like indiscernible run rate the legacy centers data correspondent business looks like maybe million for a full quarter based off that million number given im wondering how you think about that business moving forward the trends there and then i guess it was slide you gave the combined noninterest income of million for this past quarter which obviously is kind of a big jump from the back half of last year on a combined basis if that is in the applestoapples so just frame up the trends if you could and especially that correspondent banking stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation sure stephen ill take that question as it relates to what john had talked about in his prepared remarks weve tried to build the business so that when rates go up of course our core funding will just the margin will increase south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 but when rates decrease we have some countercyclical businesses that hopefully offset some of that pressure it wont offset all of it but it will offset some of it and youve seen that as our ppnr has been fully flat yearover year so thats a high level comment as it relates to the million on slide ill give you the breakdown on a combined business basis for the quarter the mortgage banking income would have been about million million would have been rough numbers would have been the correspondent banking and then about million to million would have been the wealth management business so those three add up to about million of the million the other million would just be the ordinary service charges card fees kind of reoccurring fees as far as our outlook on those businesses as i mentioned mortgage had a blowout quarter and as john mentioned or will mentioned billion worth of production which was just superb given that weve had less we had fewer than employees in the office to be able to do that this really speaks highly of the team and ph tom and stephen and brent that business continue the pipelines continue to be strong and so as best we can tell that business continues to do well as it relates to the correspondent business fixed income has picked up in that business the interest rate swap business has been very good i would expect over time that the interest rate swap business in an environment like this would not be as good over the next few quarters still be strong but just be less strong just given the credit environment generally around that so hopefully thats helpful we think the business itself the noninterest income fee businesses and the business owners who own that theyve just done a great job and its really helped out in the middle of a lot of margin pressure stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great that is very helpful congrats on getting the deal closed and thank you guys so much for all the combined data given in the presentation that thats very useful so thank you john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you operator our next question is from jennifer demba of suntrust please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc question on your lending pipeline what kind of nearterm loan growth are you expecting and what are you seeing in terms of interest from your borrowers right now thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah jennifer this is john ill take that youre watching this play out on the evening news every night as states open and then they close again and ive had the chance to travel around this quarter to five of our six states trying to get a pulse of whats going on ive had calls with all of our presidents for the quarter the last quarter we did see the loan portfolios decline slightly in five of our six states but we actually saw some growth in the state of north carolina generally the pipelines are down now about to and i think our approach is we really want to lean in and take care of our existing clients through this process but as far as new business is concerned we want to be prudent and conservative in our underwriting until theres more clarity ph past the virus so i do think that new loan growth will be somewhat muted in the next couple of quarters as we navigate through this jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you and my second question is on cost savings will you said you have some cost savings in the second half of this year can you give us a sense of how much of that million might be realized this year william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation you know jennifer it wont be a significant amount the bulk of it will come in and the largest of course once we do our system conversion but there are savings we realize along the way both through some head count reduction and some vendor renegotiations but the vast majority of them will come in i dont have a good hard number to give you for the rest of this year but i dont want you to think we hadnt achieved some already and wont be achieving some more this year jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc and did you have some unusual expenses in the second quarter that might not reoccur in third quarter for example related to ppp lending or that kind of thing william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation we have jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc indiscernible south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation on our audio gap associated with the origination of loans and so on the ppp side specifically thats in there but we do have in the deck and here about million in expenses where we were paying extra to branch employees who are working in the branches and extra staff expense associated with the virus so about million jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you so much william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation its in one of the pages of the deck i just dont have right in front of me jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you operator our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons of d a davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning guys robert r hill jr a executive chairman south state corp hey kevin john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co just i appreciate all the comments and all the detail on how youre looking at the loss absorption just between the traditional reserve build and all the complexity accounting complexity with the deal but then also the fair value discounts on the acquired loans so all that being said how do you all think about reserve building going forward were obviously going to learn new information september got a new update on the duration of what were looking at and get new forecasts but i have to think given that its a fair statement that if you agree with it the bulk of reserve building is behind you but if thats true im just trying to get a sense for how youre going to look at the reserve or provisioning over the back half of the year and particularly as it relates to the million in ppp fees coming due south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 will most of that fall to the bottom line or will you look to take a chunk of that and throw more to the reserve or are there other things thanks william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation thank you kevin ill take a stab at that and if dan wants to elaborate he can if needed like everyone our cecl model has a number of loss drivers in it and the loss drivers are based upon economic forecasts given the forwardlooking nature of the cecl so as of june we feel like our process led to the appropriate level of reserves based upon economic forecasts at that time should they worsen from here we and the industry as a whole will need to build reserves further from this level so i think if i were to convey to you a great deal of confidence about where i thought provisions were heading for us or anyone else at this point that would be misleading theres just too much too many unanswered questions and too much unknown about how this pandemic and its impact on the economy goes but we feel very good about the reserves we have on the balance sheet today very good about the capital position and that degree of unrecognized capital we have and like we i think i referenced in my comments but also in the deck a portion of that doesnt make its way into our capital ratios the allowance on the pcd loans of about million is not in capital and of course the discounts arent either so about million of that number does not appear in our capital ratios but anyway its a bit of a nonanswer because frankly we just dont have a good crystal ball at this point about future economic forecasts kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co got it all right thank you will one just additional question deferrals i guess looks like decline to a little under on a combined basis and i know a lot of banks are seeing a lot of moving parts over in coming weeks between more around one deferrals maturing and additional new entrants to round two extensions im just curious based on what youre seeing now where you think that 117orso of deferrals settles when you get toward the end of august or so john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah kevin its john dan bockhorst is on the line he is our chief credit officer and hes got a pretty good handle on that dan daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah thank you john if you look at that slide of the deck so far approximately of the deferrals have expired and the percentage of the loans on deferral has declined from approximately to that number as another of deferrals expire over the next several weeks we expect that trend to continue and we estimate well end up in the midsingledigit percentage of loans on deferral the future is still somewhat unknown on what the continued impact of covid19 will be and there is the potential for indiscernible in deferrals long term but we like the way the trends are going right now william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 and kevin this is will ill just let me also just remind you one thing thats not unique but somewhat unique to us and that is that with the acquisition as you see in the deck we articulated the categories or the screening process for determining pcd loans and all of the lodging portfolio from centerstate and all of the loans on deferral from centerstate were classified as pcd and as you saw the pcd book has about a mark on it so we think we have an appropriate capital set aside hopefully for those as well kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co and on the second deferral john to your comment earlier about you thought it was the right approach to be generous im assuming when folks ask for second theres much more of a rigorous creditdriven process being applied to them john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah thats exactly right dan you want to comment on the credit process when someone ask for a second renewal daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah for the second renewal there is a much more rigorous process were updating financials really determining that there is a need that the deferral request is coming from a company that has been impacted by the current economic environment and were also really pushing strong for those that do get a second deferral that second deferral is interest only as opposed to a full principal linked and interest deferral on round one about of the deferrals were interest only and in round two its still a little bit early but about right now are on interest only so we like the way that trend is heading and its going in the right direction kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co all right thank you very much guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from catherine mealor of kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning robert r hill jr a executive chairman south state corp good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning catherine south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a lot of great color on the ppnr forecast i think my only followup on that is just on the combined expense base will i think you said that combined youre at about million and is it fair to say it doesnt feel like theres a lot of onetime kind of in that number it feels like you probably have a little bit of elevated from mortgage but in the fee income but assuming that that all stays fairly strong near term you should probably have expenses stay around that level and then it feels like the million you mentioned was paying for extra staff maybe thats offset by the fas so youre kind of awash there and so i guess big picture is that million is a good core number to grow from here from the back half of the year before we start layering on cost savings william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah catherine let me start that and maybe steve can talk a little bit about the efficiency ratios in those businesses but it is given the strength of our noninterest income business lines that does make the job of forecasting not any more difficult because those business lines compensation structures as you know are largely incentivebased or commissionbased and so when we see growth in revenue in those business lines obviously we see growth in expenses i mentioned in my comments that the relative nie growth from prior quarters relative to the noninterest income growth in prior quarters but that does make it a little more of a challenge so the answer to your question is at current levels of noninterest income production the nie levels would probably be a good estimate where well be if those were to fall or rise from here then it would accordingly react but steve you want to mention something about the efficiency of those businesses a bit stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation sure will yes thanks catherine i think there is a back to the slides on the deck towards the end of the presentation it gives a historical perspective of the financial statements and it looks at that the trend rate for non interest expense and for noninterest income and one of the things youll notice for instance is in the fourth quarter our noninteresting was around million our adjusted noninterest expense was in the million so if you run that math forward you can see that weve had additional noninterest income of million in the last couple of quarters and about additional noninterest expense of about million so that its really running an additional efficiency ratio on the additional noninterest income and of course thats blended across all those commission businesses but i think thats a general good way to model it depending hope thats helpful catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats really helpful yes thank you so much steve its great and then this is a cecl question since this is a new role for all of us and so my question is will you mentioned that you put most of the or all the ones that are in the lodging book and then all of the centerstate ones that are deferral into pcd and so as those roll off deferral does that change anything with your reserve or the way to you think about your board expected losses or because you just categorize that as pcd you dont have to make any kind of quartertoquarter change as the quality of those loans perhaps get better or worse south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation catherine once a loan is pcd its pcd unless we make unless we have another decision event around re underwriting if you will so they are pcd forever as we determine the need for the allowance indiscernible the economy improves and forecasts and it dictates a lower reserve needed than we have then it comes back in via reduced provisioning or i guess in some circumstances negative provisioning so thats how it works catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay that sounds good but just coming off the deferral wouldnt necessarily generate a large reserve release in that estimate i guess indiscernible william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation no no it would really be more that might be a good credit factor about our thoughts about that collectability of that loan of course but that in and of itself no catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right great and then just one kind of just big picture question indiscernible markets i feel like last we spoke some of your coastal markets were doing actually relatively better than any other markets of the country and of course were hearing of a lot more covid cases in florida and along the coast and so just can you provide just some broad general color around what youre hearing from your customers in your local businesses and any specific markets or types of credit that youre more worried about now than you may have been in the last quarter thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven sure catherine this is john as i mentioned i have traveled to five of the six states and ive had calls with all of the market presidents in the last two weeks ive got a lot of feedback from them so let me describe for you what im seeing as the new covid economy because theres winners and losers in the new covid economy anything thats related to home improvement is slant theyre just as busy as theyve ever been residential is performing very good residential construction is performing very good theres not a lot of residential product on the market so im hearing of cases of multiple offers on homes im hearing of cases where people are purchasing homes through video chat from a recreation standpoint where people are so cooped up at home businesses that are connected to the boating business so the rv business are doing phenomenally well i heard a story you cannot buy a bicycle in the city of charlotte because those businesses have performed so well trucking and logistics you think about whats going on with the distribution channels right now theyre performing very well im hearing that out of lakeland florida hearing that out of charlotte medical medical has bounced back interesting note somebody said the cosmetic surgery business has performed very well because you can have cosmetic surgery now and recover at home in privacy so dental businesses the dental business is basically shut down in the month of april theyre all back and the dental south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 businesses that ask for deferral none of them are asking for a second deferral so those are all very positive elements of the new covid economy the negatives are kind of obvious its anything eventdriven whether thats conferences or catering those businesses are suffering hotels hotels its kind of a tale of two stories theres leisure hotels and then theres business hotels the leisure hotels are really coming back and that represents about twothirds of our hotel budget more leisureoriented if you can get these hotels up to about to occupancy they can start carrying their pi payments on a breakeven basis and were seeing that with the leisure side the business side however is a different story thats going to be a lot longer recovery cycle and then on the retail side clearly longer term weve known that theres the secular trends in retail but for our book its very tenantspecific the single tenant businesses seem to performing better anything with a drivethru seems to be performing better so we dont see near as much lost content in the retail side as we would in the restaurant space so i hope that gives you some color of what were seeing as far as the new covid economy catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah its really helpful john thank you so much and congrats on a great quarter guys and closing the deal john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you robert r hill jr a executive chairman south state corp thank you catherine operator our next question comes from christopher marinac of janney please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks i wanted to follow up on the credit perspective as it pertains to the deferrals at what point do those get risk rated to either special mention or substandard is that coming up on the fall or is that already happening for you now john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven dan daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yes that is happening now that is primarily a third quarter event in the second quarter we saw a migration into watch in this quarter for those businesses that are seeking a second round of deferrals were evaluating those risk ratings most of them would probably end up in a criticizedtype category as we go through this quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc so dan well probably see some adjustment in the 10q coming up in november is that fair daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yes christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thanks for that and then just a followup on what happens to a loan that has been acquired it has a fair value mark and then it pays off and perhaps its renewed as a new loan how do you reserve for that does the reserve before the fair value mark become a guidepost and how you treat that new loan william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah chris my answer would be that thats a separate discrete decision at that point and the past mark or allowance required for that loan would not necessarily be a guide for what the future would be it may very well be correlated but that wouldnt be the guide in my view christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay it just gets back to kevins question on reserves and overall how that goes is why i asked william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation sure sure and i know all of us have a very very cloudy economic crystal ball hopefully what we and the industry are doing in terms of building serves ultimately is setting aside capital it does not get charged off in losses but at this point its just too hard to know whats going to happen in the economy so christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no i appreciate it thanks for all the background this morning william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation certainly thank you operator our next question is a followup from stephen scouten of piper sandler please go ahead stephen kendall q scouten analyst piper sandler co south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 31jul2020 hey guys thanks so let me throw one more in here john i appreciate all your comments about the new covid economy that was incredibly helpful i was wondering just in particular you guys noted the exposures around your retail loans being primarily in three of the florida markets and im just curious in particular those markets that youre seeing i think it was cant find my slide but i think it was tampa maybe orlando and one other market im just kind of curious again maybe piggybacking of catherines question just what youre seeing in terms of new shutdowns or fear down there in those markets john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah good question stephen florida has been on the forefront of opening the economy and it does not seem like theres political will to close the economy things have opened up considerably i would tell you the markets in miamidade county broward and palm beach theyre going to be the more restrictive economies whereas tampa and orlando are not as restrictive stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it very helpful thanks john john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven you bet operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to john corbett for any closing remarks john c corbett chief executive
