highlights of our fourth quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of adjusted for notable items earnings per common share were return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was we were pleased to see loan balances rebound substantially during the quarter driven by robust new production activity as total loans increased by billion and excluding ppp runoff loans increased by billion consistent with our plan we reduced core expenses excluding notable items by million from last quarter driven by the realization of cost synergies and ongoing highly disciplined expense management we managed absolute core expense dollars lower while continuing to grow investments in strategic areas across the bank such as digital capabilities marketing to drive new customer acquisition and relationship deepening and select new personnel additions to support our revenue growth initiatives within fee income categories we saw continued momentum in our capital markets as well as wealth and investment businesses strong credit performance continued to be a hallmark with net chargeoffs of basis points and nonperforming assets declining by from the prior quarter we actively managed our capital base repurchasing million of common stock in the fourth quarter todate we have completed million of our million share repurchase program turning to slide periodend loan balances increased by quarteroverquarter totaling billion total loan balances excluding ppp increased billion or during the quarter driven by commercial loans within commercial excluding ppp loans increased by billion or compared to the prior quarter this huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 growth was broad based across all major portfolios and was driven by record new commercial loan production growth was led by middle market corporate and specialty banking which increased by billion and represented of total commercial loan growth this quarter inventory finance increased by million auto dealer floor plan increased by million asset finance increased by million and commercial real estate increased by million within corporate and specialty banking each of our commercial verticals contributed to growth this quarter including corporate banking tech and telecom healthcare and franchise inventory finance growth was driven by a combination of seasonally higher balances due to inventory shipments in the quarter as well as expansion of existing customer programs higher utilization levels drove approximately twothirds of the increased balances in auto floor plan we are continuing to add new dealer relationships and growing our overall commitment levels in addition balances benefited from improved utilization rates which increased from the mid to approximately in the quarter even as we delivered record loan production calling activities across the business continued at a rapid pace we ended the quarter with commercial loan pipelines of higher versus the prior quarter and higher than prior year supporting our outlook for continued loan growth exppp throughout on the consumer side residential mortgage increased by million and auto increased by million this was offset by home equity which declined by million turning to slide deposit balances increased by billion as we continue to experience elevated customer liquidity and optimize our funding reducing cd balances by over million consumer deposit balances increased by billion from the prior quarter commercial balances increased by million from the prior quarter on slide reported net interest income declined modestly from the prior quarter as a result of lower ppp revenue core net interest income excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion was stable at billion with ending loan balances well above average balances for the quarter we entered the first quarter of with a solid launch point from which to grow core net interest income going forward additionally we continued to manage excess liquidity by funding loan growth and adding to the securities portfolio reducing excess cash at the fed to billion from billion at priorquarter end on an average basis for the quarter excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately basis points turning to slide we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to increase asset sensitivity and provide downside protection during the fourth quarter we added billion of securities and we continued to optimize our hedging program we terminated billion of receive fixed swaps and floors and we entered into new pay fixed swaps in order to bolster our asset sensitivity as rates move higher we opportunistically added billion of receive fixed swaps in order to manage downside risks at yearend our modeled net interest income asset sensitivity in an up basis points scenario was we have steadily increased this metric over the past months supporting our ability to continue to capture upside opportunity as interest rates increase moving to slide noninterest income was million up million yearoveryear and down million from last quarter lower fee revenues in the fourth quarter were driven by a decline in mortgage banking primarily as a result of lower saleable spreads our targeted focus on growing strategic fee revenue streams continue to bear fruit with capital market fees up million or from the prior quarter wealth and investments and insurance also performed quite well card and payments revenues which are typically seasonally flat from q3 to q4 declined slightly from the prior quarter ph impacted at the margin by atm volumes and the debit card conversion for tcf customers during the month of october the huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 underlying core business activity in cards and payments continues to be very solid and we saw a restoration of ongoing growth in that business as the quarter progressed after conversion deposit service charges declined million compared to the prior quarter as a result of tcf customers transitioning onto the huntingtons fair play product set moving on to slide noninterest expense declined million from the prior quarter and excluding notable items core expenses declined by million to billion as we captured cost savings from the acquisition and exercised disciplined expense management as we shared previously we expect our core expenses to trend down in the first and second quarters fairly ratably over that period to approximately billion by the second quarter even as we work to bring down expense levels were continuing to invest in initiatives that will drive sustainable revenue growth while being disciplined in managing our overall expense base as you saw last quarter we took additional actions in order to free up capacity to support these investments while remaining committed to the ph absolute core expense declines in the near term over the longer term we expect expense growth to be a function of revenue growth as we manage within our commitment to positive operating leverage slide highlights our capital position common equity tier ended the quarter at consistent with our prior guidance to operate within the lower half of our to operating guideline we have million remaining of our current share repurchase program as you can see on slide credit quality continues to perform well net chargeoffs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter our nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter our ending allowance for credit losses represented of total loans down from at priorquarter end the improving economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of million in the fourth quarter slide covers our mediumterm financial goals we are focused on driving sustained revenue growth while managing expenses within our long term commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a 17plus return on tangible common equity we expect to begin seeing this performance in the second half of finally turning to slide let me share a couple of thoughts on our expectations for our outlook is based on the starting point of our most recent quarterly results with expectations for yearoveryear comparisons for the fourth quarter of it also assumes continued economic expansion aligned to market consensus as well as interest rate yield curve expectations as of early january we expect average loan growth exppp to be up high single digits based on our starting point of billion as a result of loan growth and modestly higher net interest margin we expect core net interest income on a dollar basis excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion to grow in the highsingle digit to lowdouble digits range fee revenues are expected to be up lowsingle digits driven by robust growth in key categories aligned to our strategies including capital markets our card and treasury management payments businesses and wealth and advisory with offsetting impact from lower yearoveryear revenues in mortgage banking and the continued evolution of our fair play products as mentioned we expect to continue to drive sequential reduction in core expenses for the next several quarters as we fully realize the tcf cost synergies and benefit from broader expense management at the same time we are continuing to invest in our strategic growth initiatives and new revenue synergy opportunities we expect the quarterly run rate of core expenses to be approximately billion by the second quarter and then remaining relatively stable over the second half of the year from that level huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 in closing were keenly focused on the revenue opportunities ahead of us we have the teams directed toward these key initiatives and were confident in our outlook to deliver on this plan we believe these drivers of our outlook are aligned with our goals for sustained revenue growth a 17plus return on tangible common equity and our commitment to annual positive operating leverage now let me pass it back to steve for a couple of closing comments before we open up for qa stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zach slide summarizes what we believe is a compelling opportunity huntington stands as a powerful top regional bank with scale and leading market density as well as a compelling set of capabilities both in footprint and nationally were focused on driving sustainable revenue growth which is bolstered by new markets and new businesses this growth opportunity augments our underlying businesses in many cases where we have top market positions as a result of these factors weve demonstrated robust financial performance that we expect to further improve as we move throughout we believe our return on capital will be in the top tier versus peers which results in substantial value creation for shareholders tim lets open up the call for qa timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks steve operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe just wanted to follow up around the expense guidance zach you mentioned about billion flat lining in the back half but just give us a little bit of puts and takes in terms of where the savings are coming right now im sure much like everyone else youre investing in the franchise so if you dont mind giving us a lens of like how we should think about little bit of a mediumterm expense growth outlook or are there saving opportunities at the bank where expenses could be around these levels for more than just zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks for the question i think its an area of important focus for us as well indiscernible really pleased with the trajectory that were on here and weve talked about it for a while were committed to take our expenses from the highwater mark in q3 of of billion down to that billion over a threequarter period and we saw the first step down in q4 of million we expect to see the remaining fairly ratably in q1 and q2 and then fairly steady for the balance of i think as you get beyond and on to the future the way were looking at it is to manage within the confines of our commitment to positive operating leverage just as we have for the eight of the last nine years given our revenue growth trajectory and what we expect to be pretty solid and sustained revenue growth thatll provide the capacity to maintain expenses within that level and still invest back in the business and clearly there will be plenty of opportunities as we go forward to continue to drive scale efficiencies process improvement automation and lots of ways to drive efficiencies thatll allow us to plough back investments into the key initiatives while still achieving that positive operating leverage ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 got it and just as a followup as part of the loan growth guidance if you could remind us i mean tcf obviously had a bunch of businesses that are levered towards capex and inventory rebuild both in auto dealer and outside of that how much of that is baked into this loan growth guidance and whats the potential for loan growth actually exceeding expectations that youve outlined zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so the guidance as we talked about was highsingle digits for loan growth overall itll be driven by production i think it will look pretty similar to what we saw in q4 that is commercial led driven by production and really supported by what were seeing from our customers and just really robust pipeline and calling activities at this point and its across all the commercial sectors including those that weve now incorporated from tcf middle market corporate banking specialty verticals but also really important contributors from the inventory finance business the vendor and asset finance business that we picked up from tcf as well in addition i would point out continued contribution from the consumer side as well we are expecting sustained growth in resi ph on sheet auto rv and marine and also likely benefiting there from lower prepays as we go forward we have assumed a modest contribution from utilization improvement during the year and that will contribute to some degree but i would note that that billion of line utilization below prepandemic levels is just a massive coiled spring that will enable us to fuel growth likely some in the back half of much more as we go out to the future into and beyond ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc helpful thank you for taking my questions operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question i wanted to stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i wanted to start by maybe drilling down a little into the margin zach maybe sort of your best thoughts on how you see the margin trajecting throughout the year i guess maybe the best starting point is probably the adjusted margin and to the extent that youre comfortable any thoughts on sort of your best estimate for how much benefit you would get from each fed rate hike zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 yeah its a great question the guidance implies stable to slightly higher and thats my expectation to continue to kind of trend ratably higher as we go forward and i think the dynamic that well see is very similar to what weve been talking about for a while well see a slow rolloff of our previous preexisting hedging program but thatll be offset by benefits in reductions in the level of excess liquidity and the drag on margin that that represents we talked about basis point drag in q4 indiscernible we do expect a lot of that to run off if not all of it to run off during which will be a benefit and then the rate environment which to the point of your question is somewhat uncertain just given where the expectations for rate hikes are at this point in the forward yield curve but i do expect that to be a positive contributor as we go forward here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and just sort of to be clear i think in your prepared remarks you noted that the nii guide was based on early january market expectations so does that embed then three fed rate hikes into the guidance zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah correct so the planning and budgeting that weve completed was based on the early january rate curve that had three rate hikes in it over the last few weeks clearly the curve has moved and sort of roughly pulled about a month forward what had previously been a trajectory around the forward yield curve ph such that now theres i think a fourth hike now forecasted in the very last period in the year that should be helpful for our q4 guidance but i would point you back to the guidance as likely being the key range there inclusive of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks scott operator our next question is coming from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so the net interest income outlook for has a pretty wide range highsingle digit to low double digit can you walk through because youre basing it on the forward curve so what is the swing factor that will take you either to the low end of that range or high end of that range huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i mean id say its mainly driven by where we end on asset growth the more asset growth we have the more kind of incremental nii lift well have on a growth basis just given the fact that the yield will be stable to up thats the big driver there i think as well just further to the last question where the rate curve ends up going throughout the course of the year its clearly been somewhat volatile here over the last several months at ph where it is now i think our guidance stands and but those are the dynamics that ph drives the range of that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so if the average loans come out of highsingle digits youd be somewhere on the midpoint is that safe to assume of the nii guide zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc correct steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then on expenses you guys seem to be one of the few banks not lifting the expense outlook given all this lockdown inflation are you just not seeing as much wage pressure and inflation in your footprint or are you just finding more offsets that others arent finding thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah look i think were clearly seeing some indicators of inflation within the business i would most notably hiring new talent and ph we started with the compensation expectations from our top talent and i would note when we talk to our clients particularly those that are commodityintensive businesses or labor intensive businesses their feeling is having to adjust to manage it at this point the direct impacts on our expense base have been relatively limited and we anticipate some wage inflation as were going into the year and try to get ahead of it we took a series of actions around compensation we announced an increase to our minimum wage across the company to an hour from what had previously been we made a number of other priority adjustments and so we think weve got it boxed now in the plan and included in our guidance lastly i guess i would id call it i think theres a unique point in time that we have that perhaps some others dont where weve got the benefits of scale coming from the tcf acquisition both the cost synergies that weve already defined and are executing against but over the long term we see more opportunities to continue to refine huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 and get scale efficiencies so that also i think contributes and helping us to maintain that really solid expense growth ph plus some revenues stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steven just to add on we took some actions in the third quarter and that includes branch consolidations that will happen in early february and we took some other management what we stylize as organization issues as well so we anticipated some level of inflation coming into the year well try to get ahead of it with those actions taken in the third quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay very good thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys good morning i was wondering zach in the outlook for nii you talked about the loan growth side i was just wondering if you could fill that in and tell us how youre thinking about both the growth and mix on the deposit side zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i do expect to see deposit growth begin to accelerate here and i think it will be a pretty balanced mix between consumer and commercial as we go forward for the last several quarters weve been putting sort of smaller emphasis on that just given how strong liquidity has been throughout the system and the teams are re pivoting back to drive that growth and so thatll be a good balance to ph fund what we expect to be as i noted accelerated loan growth throughout the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 right and thats what i was wondering like are you expecting earning assets to still grow or is it more about remixing the left side of the balance sheet zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc look i think well see a bit of incremental growth in the securities portfolio were watching the elevated liquidity situation pretty closely and same playbook weve been operating with the last several quarters just taking an incremental view monthbymonth looking at where that trend is and optimizing to see if its appropriate to add additional securities but i do think theres ph going to be some remixing as we see loan growth start to accelerate to hit the highsingle digit guidance that weve given ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay and the just can you tell us in your fee guide what youre using in terms of the fair play impact and outlook on overdrafts and related fees thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure yeah lets talk about that stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc okay let me start we introduced fair play years ago so brought out 24hour grace and asteriskfree checking weve been doing i think almost every year the in we noted all the deposits but more recently in we put the safety zone in minimum and we took 24hour grace to our business customers because of the pandemic and the impact on small businesses and we felt that was the right time and thing to do to help those businesses at that point in time and last year we came forward with standby cash in early pay and obviously weve rolled all that out effective with the conversion to the tcf customers so we pointed out an expected drag off that weve gotten ourselves into a leadership position i think for more than the last decade in this area its added to our brand value our customer household growth our relationship retention and expansion and significant deepening across products so that has added to our brand and our loyalty and i think as we go forward well still retain this leadership role there are plans we have in place of going back number of months to do some more looking out for our customers with fair play obviously with what the industry is doing and pivot in the last month or so were watching that closely and we would expect to react to that and well communicate more going forward but that guidance range includes what were contemplating as we move forward this year in fair play and ph other piece maybe zach you could embellish the guidance ph if you will zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah let me tack on to what the comment steve just made when we construct these product changes we think about the economics holistically there are fees that we see on a gross basis like overdraft but there are also a lot of other levers in the consumer checking product economics like other related account fees other product features and over time really importantly the impact that that market leadership position has on elevated huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 acquisition the kind of retention and the relationship deepening that we can drive and so to be clear included in my guidance on the overall fee line is the assumption of a net fee reduction of approximately million in q4 from these changes i would expect them to be in place by the middle of the year i would highlight that notwithstanding that impact we do expect to see continued growth on the overall fee line as indicated by my guidance in the lowsingle digits driven by those strategic categories capital markets payments wealth and advisory in addition to the fee impacts from the changes were anticipating in our consumer products we also expect to see a reduction of between million and million per quarter in chargeoffs as the lower overdraft fees that we charge on a gross basis create just fewer incidences of uncollectible fees and it has lower chargeoffs just taking a step back maybe kind of concluding on this discussion we really believe that the positioning of our products is critical and as we maintain that market leadership this is a play weve run many times before and the benefits we see in acquisition retention and deepening as we maintain that leadership we would expect to earn back that run rate fee loss in approximately to months very much consistent with what weve seen in the past ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks ken operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hey jon zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for you guys obviously the expense guidance and the revenue guidance looks pretty good and theres one piece that we havent tackled and thats provisions and just curious how you feel about credit and risk you still have fairly high reserves relative to peers i know some of thats accounting but with the ph lower huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 loss expectations and zach what you just said as ph loan chargeoffs can you help us think through the provision expectations richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i mean this is rich let me take that we feel very good about the condition of the portfolio right now the chargeoffs for the year and the reduction in the npas both notable and both very positive as it relates to the provision and the allowance we have always been on the conservative side of the allowance and we started cecl day one on the high end and weve been very conservative on the way up and i think very prudent on the way down and well continue that way and there are things that were looking at in the economy as it relates to supply chain and labor that type of thing and just the continuing impacts of the covid that are just giving us pause as it relates to where we set the allowance but its a very disciplined process that we go through every quarter weve had five consecutive reductions in the acl ratio since we peaked in the third quarter of and well look at it every quarter as we always do with a very disciplined approach and if the supply chain ease conditions ease and labor conditions start to improve i would expect that well have continued reductions over time stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc jon our outlook is for reductions during and chargeoffs below the historic range and we ended the year with very good credit quality and very pleased with the performance of the portfolio that came over with tcf so loans have been re ph rated so theres consistency now as of the end of year and the economic outlook plus what we see in the customer bases is gives us a lot of optimism as we go forward on the provision line jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay that helps and then just as a followup steve maybe more of a mediumterm view on credit it seems like you obviously have strong growth and i know youre a risk person by nature but the entire industry has strong growth expectations as well curious how long you think this all lasts without any real concerns on credit stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc my current belief jon is that were going to go through with a fairly robust gdp growth and performance on credit and theres just an enormous amount of stimulus thats been enacted thus far and some of it is multiyear were ph look the economy has performed well but theres been labor constraint as that sorts out i think that puts longer legs into the growth the supply chain issues that we face that are constraining production did constrain in will do so for much of if not all year will get abated over time we think things will get better a bit in the second half but in some of these industries will become a more normal year so those factors and others give us confidence that weve got a multiyear positive slope on loan growth and gdp and underlying credit quality indiscernible remain disciplined and we published the quarterly results for consumer and theres literally no variance over the last decadeplus so were quite confident of our capabilities to manage the risks at these levels were very pleased with the additional talent weve gathered from tcf both in the origination side and in the credit areas as we think about the future so or beyond would be where were a little more concerned than we will be over the next few years huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks a lot steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks jon operator our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush please proceed with your questions peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning zach i wanted to follow up on kens questions just with regards to the outlook for service charges on deposit with the fair play so it was down million this quarter can you just go through what the outlook is from fourth quarter levels just with the puts and takes that you talked about again zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure absolutely good question we converted the tcf customers on the second week of october so we have almost the entire quarters worth of run rate of the tcf customers on to the fair play product in q4 there might be a very marginal incremental impact into q1 but for the most part were kind of at the new level trending and as we said we are continuing to roll out new product changes frankly of the same kind of nature that we were doing across the last years but we do expect to respond to whats happening and to do that by the middle of this year and that will drive the roughly million incremental quarterly run rate reduction in fees on a net basis by q4 just to be clear in the guidance so those are i think the puts and takes kind of a relatively flat level and then well see a that those new changes come into place at midyear with that roughly million quarterly reduction in q4 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it got it and thats helpful and then just i was wondering could you just give an update on revenue synergies from tcf where youre seeing the biggest opportunities and whats happening in some of the newer markets and i think back to the firstmerit deal i think it was about million in revenue synergies im just wondering if maybe you could quantify what the impact could be with tcf zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah were really really pleased with where theyre going weve talked about this a little bit in multiple conferences ph but there are four or five big buckets of them the expanding our corporate business in the middle market the corporate space our specialty businesses into the major commercial hubs within the formerly tcf geographic footprint like what should expanding in chicago expanding in detroit denver is brand new minneapolis and st paul brand new to huntington so thats a big one bringing the consumer product set to tcf customers were seeing is the second major bucket and were seeing terrific early signs of engagement in how folks are reacting to not only the product set but the digital channels and huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 capabilities third is expanding our business banking and market leading sba production into the tcf geographies and were well underway hiring out those teams and beginning to get early traction wealth management and private banking is an enormous fourth opportunity for us and weve already begun to build out very significant teams for example in minneapolis twin cities and in denver and then lastly just leveraging the really now quite sizeable scale equipment and inventory finance business combining what we had before and then the great businesses that we brought over from tcf so those are the five big buckets and were seeing traction and wins already we havent given precise guidance on that in the past im not ready to do that today but its already contributing to the growth outlook and helping us to drive the kind of acceleration that we expect to see in both fees and loans in and as we go forward we could even provide more and more color on that as those continues to develop stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc zach if i could add the capital markets fee income lift in the fourth quarter was at least in part related to the combination of tcf so middle market banking didnt exist in chicago or the twin cities or denver for tcf the brokerdealer was outsourced when we talk about wealth theres just a there are a number of product categories and capabilities that we have that well be bringing into these expanded markets and then in the context of the things that tcf did incredibly well asset finance inventory finance et cetera we have now the ability to crosssell into that customer base which historically was not done so on the consumer side million consumers that we have a much more robust product menu set that well be offering and were a multiple on home equity and again which was not offered in the ph abridged delivery system by tcf as well as mortgage so were excited across the board we think we have a lot of consumer endbusiness opportunities on the crosssell side peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your questions erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just had a few cleanup questions on nii sensitivity but steve i thought it was very interesting when a large bank kicked off earnings saying 24hour grace and something you kicked off years ago my first question is for zach zach could you tell us in the nii sensitivity what youre assuming for deposit repricing in that analysis and what do you expect to actually happen as you think about the first few rate hikes zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a good question erika thank you as it relates to deposit betas i think its a little too early to tell were expecting similar dynamics to the last major rate cycle we do believe therell be competing forces here huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 indiscernible the extremely low level of starting rates were at right now would tend to indicate a higher beta with that being said the level of extraordinary levels of excess liquidity across the system would tend to mute that and indicate a lower beta so id say were watching the situation very carefully on liquidity and the pace of loan growth we will be disciplined and dynamic as we go forward in the actual modeling of the asset sensitivity those models are intended to be stable on average over time and irrespective of the current level of interest rates to model the ramp and so the assumptions in that are around to beta which has been the long term average weve seen i would tell you i believe theres an opportunity that it will be lower than that in the initial rate moves and thats my general expectation but again i think well be well have to be dynamic and well watch it really carefully erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and my followup question to that is yesterday and this kind of follows up to what ken usdin was asking about earlier a few regional banks were now expecting negative deposit growth to your earlier point zach the system is awash with liquidity and a few big banks kicked off earnings season saying that deposit growth wont be negative and a few regional banks mentioned yesterday that they expect deposit growth to be negative and im wondering huntington has always been known for its core operational deposit base plus you added tcf im wondering how youre thinking about deposit growth you mentioned its going to be positive this year but as we have more maturity in the rate cycle how do you expect deposit growth to behave on an overall basis zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i do think our current expectation and the trend were seeing in the business would indicate well continue to see deposit growth in i think theres sort of two factors weve been watching that are slightly offsetting each other on one hand we are observing particularly in the consumer space some degree of normalization of the elevated liquidity that we saw build up at the tail end of and certainly into largely influenced by stimulus and other factors like that and the ph stayathomes behavior around covid so that is a sort of a gradual normalization with that being said our customer acquisition and the ongoing work were doing to deepen relationships certainly augmented by the tcf synergy opportunities are offsetting that and we expect to drive net growth in consumer offsetting that indiscernible pandemic deposit normalization trend that i noted on the commercial side were seeing just continued robust liquidity in our clients and thats driving solid deposit growth and as we focus on that even more going forward to continue to fund this accelerating loan growth well see that contribute as well so overall im expecting pretty balanced deposit growth between the two and i think those are the kind of underlying drivers of it stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc zach if i could add to erikas question weve put a liquidity portal in play for our commercial customers a year and a half ago to try and take excess deposits and move them off balance sheet erika so were not sitting with a cumulative superjumbo set of commercial depositors in the portfolio we just didnt want that risk profile plus we felt we could do a better job looking at the customers by putting them into indiscernible so that will help cushion ourselves as wherever normalization if there is any ph out of the customer base occurs huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 secondly weve introduced a digital tool an analytics tool that has great promise for us weve got roughly business customers and were now able to get at the data in a much more realtime way in terms of product needs based on usage and other characteristics so we expect that will drive our tm business in a significant way in the years ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc very helpful thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc indiscernible thanks for your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes operator the next question is coming from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning you guys are the number one sba lender and i was wondering if you could talk about what youre seeing in terms of demand there now that ppp is kind of mostly done or winding down i would imagine when ppp was going on there was kind of little to no demand and im wondering how thats been trending more recently stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc matt we had a cumulative with tcf over billion of ppp lending and notwithstanding that we had robust sba lending almost in parallel through the last two years as we entered the fourth quarter we continued to see demand for that product and we expect it will actually increase this year in part because of the new markets that were going to be able to expose our capabilities to twin cities great business market denver on fire really terrific colorado is a terrific state to be doing business in and now were at roughly at scale in chicago with 150plus points of distribution versus that will help those three regions drive our lending activity overall including sba matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc interesting and then separately credit quality question youre a very big auto underwriter on the consumer side and commercial but im focused on the consumer side weve had this massive increase in used car prices any thoughts in terms of tightening standards as we think about ltvs youve had a little bit of a trend down there what you disclose in the appendix but just how do you think about underwriting for these used cars that have increased versus a year ago huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah matt its rich ill take that and as you noted in the slides the ltvs have come down we peaked in at and at the end of at so we have reacted to the increase in auto prices by bringing the ltvs down but first and foremost for us the auto business is really based on client selection we are a super prime lender and weve developed a custom scorecard over many many years in this business that very effectively predicts those customers that are not going to have a payment issue and so for us its really avoiding the situation where you have to get the car back in the first place and weve done a phenomenal job of doing that over time we also feel that weve been in this business a long time and we have to be a consistent provider of capital to our dealers and so weve over the course of many cycles worked through high prices low prices high demand low demand and weve had learnings from all of that as weve been one of the leading auto dealer or auto financers in the country going back in time so i feel that weve got a good handle on the risk here notwithstanding the increase in car prices weve adjusted our custom scorecards appropriately and feel that were going to come through this in really good shape as we always have matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc indiscernible stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc matt and we havent had a delinquency on the floor plan side of this business in im going to say decades certainly more than a decade since ive been around and we really like the underlying credit quality performance that the dealers were able to generate the last couple of years so the fundamentals of the business with a low expected default rate in the indirect side and an incredibly low risk on the dealer side continue to keep us very bullish on the business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator the next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your questions john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi john zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi i guess back to that auto question i know in the in your loan growth outlook for highsingle digits for you did mention auto growth as a driver i mean on the growth side can you just talk about what how youre thinking about the portfolio growth as you look ph at the year particularly if we get some moderation in used auto demand as the lets call it the reopening continues and everything so wanted to get your updated thoughts on that portfolio specifically in terms of growth thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so john we would expect that portfolio will continue to grow were going to open up in another five or so states this year weve had this gradual rollout now for a number of years and thatll complete ph us eventually we will be in the lower with this business but we have a fundamental expectation of that the new car markets going to come back off of last years production probably by million million cars to get million million total on the new side so that will pick up a bit the mix will slightly shift again back to where it has historically or closer to that on the mix side of the equation as you know we like the business we think of it as low risk its a year average durated asset and were highly now automated we have almost half our apps coming through on a digital basis and its end to end digital for us so were very very efficient with it john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great and then also related to that i believe the utilization comment you gave earlier in terms of increasing from the mid to the thats for the floor plan business i believe which is correct me if im wrong and then if it is what is your utilization trend for the nonfloor plan commercial revolvers zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill take that we saw nice upticks modest upticks in utilization in every one of our three major line utilization categories auto just to your point rose from to in the quarter inventory finance rose from to to some degree seasonally thats typical in the fourth quarter of that business and then the general middle market revolvers went from to in the quarter so we saw good early signs here encouraging signs of that utilization recovery and we saw as i said in my earlier remarks million of additional line utilization ph to when we expect to recover back to prepandemic levels over the longer term john pancari q analyst evercore isi huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 got it got it if i could ask just one more high level one just ph off some news this morning about intel looking to build a pretty sizable chip facility there near columbus and just wanted to get your thoughts on the implications of something like that do you think theres followon benefits to the to loan demand there in your markets and do you think theres a start of something where more of these tech companies could be building operations there in your markets stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc john just for the benefit of everybody what youre referencing is intels announcing a large chip plant the ceo of intel called it the largest chip plant in the world itll be about million square feet it is initially a land set aside of acres to accommodate this its expected that there ll be followons and that therell be other businesses large businesses suppliers to that plant that will colocate as part of that acre site and this will be enormously impactful i think the ceo pat gelsinger referenced this as a silicon heartland because typically these plants with the supplier base creates some level of colocation that we would that youve seen in arizona and certain other markets so this is incredibly impactful its a great move by the dewine administration i think itll benefit certainly all of ohio and much of the midwest and i think its a bit of a game changer for us were going to have more than construction jobs on that site and roadway and water expansion and then ultimately therell be very high paying jobs in the plant itself just with intel again theres an expectation of other businesses coming in for colocation significant other businesses all of that will feed and fuel i think whats already a very robust real estate market where theres going to be housing needs therell be additional transportation needs the small business around small businesses around these areas will do very very well so its a huge moment for us here in all of ohio certainly central ohio but i think this has the potential to be enormous if i reflect back in when i joined huntington this was termed the rust belt and that term has receded significantly over the years and i think intels going to be a game changer in terms of technology in the region and im very excited about whats going on so again kudos to governor dewine and his administration lieutenant governor jon husted was enormously important here as well but this came together in an incredibly efficient and quick fashion and theres insight about it on both the local paper columbus dispatch as well as i think time has a lead article featuring it were really really pleased and i believe this is again a huge moment for us and a gamechanging moment for ohio john pancari q analyst evercore isi very helpful thanks steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks john operator thank you our final question today is from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your questions terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2022 hi thanks i was hoping to get your thoughts on capital management and just appetite for share repurchase in the first half of with capital at about at the end of the year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thats a great question thanks for presenting the chance to close on this one we are really pleased with what weve done so far in the million share repurchase authorization that we had ph as we noted consistent with our guidance front loaded million of that through the end of i think as we go forward our capital priorities have not changed were still very much focused on funding asset growth first supporting our dividend and then sort of all other uses including this so as we see loan growth accelerating were pleased to be able to put the capital back toward that and as it relates to share repurchases sorry for the background noise there we intend to be dynamic here and also to think about it in the context of our ongoing work around our next capital budget submission which is which will reset the balance of as well with a submission in early april so dynamic seizing opportunities here in the next couple of quarters i think is
