management discussion section operator good morning and welcome to keycorps third quarter earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded id now like to turn the conference over to the chairman and ceo chris gorman please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well thank you operator and good morning and welcome to keycorps third quarter earnings conference call joining me for the call today are don kimble our chief financial officer and mark midkiff our chief risk officer slide is our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and nongaap financial measures it covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the questionandanswer segment of our call im now turning to slide as you saw in our press release this morning we reported third quarter earnings per common share of our eps was more than double that which we reported in the prior quarter and up from the yearago period which was impacted by notable items despite the challenging environment we generated preprovision net revenue of billion and added billion to our reserve for credit losses through the first nine months of this year revenue in the third quarter was up from the year ago period our net interest income continues to reflect the low rate environment elevated liquidity and changes in balance sheet mix average loans reflect strong performance from consumer mortgage and laurel road offset by paydowns of consumer line draws that were made earlier in the year our consumer mortgage business generated funded volume of more than billion this quarter which was up more than from the yearago period and from last quarter over onehalf of our originations were purchase mortgages our pipelines remain strong and we expect to show sustainable growth and continued market share gains laurel road continues to originate highquality loans that provide us with an opportunity to build broader digital relationships with these targeted clients in the third quarter laurel road originated over million we believe that both laurel road and consumer mortgage will continue to be relationshipbased growth engines for our consumer business with our strong consumer platform we have decided to discontinue originating indirect auto loans the current portfolio of approximately billion will run off over time now let me turn to fee income we had another good quarter noninterest income was up from the yearago period reflecting strongerthanexpected performance investment banking and consumer mortgage had another solid quarter cards and payments and service charges on deposit accounts both posted strong linked quarter increases don will discuss our revenue outlook in his remarks we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow both our commercial and consumer businesses our expenses this quarter reflect higher variable costs related to cards and payments activity and production related incentives as well as elevated pandemicrelated costs associated with keeping our teammates and our clients safe through our continuous improvement efforts we are maintaining our focus on expenses improving our efficiency while continuing to invest for growth particularly our digital capabilities across the franchise keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 credit quality remained solid this quarter as we have remained true to our moderate risk profile throughout the cycle net chargeoffs for the quarter were basis points in the deck we have updated our disclosure on commercial portfolio focus areas don will cover these focus areas in his comments but i will just say that these portfolios have generally performed consistent with or better than our expectations the quality of our loan book is also reflected in the level of loan deferrals last quarter our deferrals were the lowest in our peer group based upon public disclosures as of september loans subject to forbearance terms were less than of total loans thats down from at june this equates to less than of clients in both our commercial and consumer businesses in the third quarter our provision expense exceeded chargeoffs by million our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of periodend loans now stands at or excluding ppp loans finally we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders in the third quarter our common equity tier ratio increased to which is at the upper end of our targeted range of to in september we paid a common stock dividend of per share the same amount we paid in the second quarter i will close by restating that this was another good quarter for key which demonstrates our underlying strengths it starts with our dedicated team and their unwavering commitment to first and foremost our clients being very targeted about where we can compete and where we can win next costs maintaining a strong focus on expenses while investing for the future a big part of this investment going forward will continue to be digital credit continuing our strong risk management practices and lastly capital focusing both on the return on and the return of capital i am confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and over time achieve our longterm financial targets and importantly deliver value for all of our stakeholders now let me turn the call over to don to go through the results of the quarter don donald r kimble vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide as chris said we reported third quarter net income from continuing operations of per common share results also reflected momentum across our businesses including growth in our balance sheet and fee income as well as continued strong risk discipline and capital management i will cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation so turning to slide total average loans were billion up from the third quarter of last year driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans reflect an increase of over billion from ppp loans consumer loans benefited from continued growth from laurel road and as chris mentioned strong performance from our residential mortgage business laurel road originated over million of student consolidation loans this quarter and we generated billion of consumer mortgage loans the investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly add highquality loans to our portfolio linked quarter average loan balances were down reflecting paydowns from the heightened commercial line draws earlier this year the paydowns on the lines were greater than expected and now the utilization rate is below the start of the year importantly we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile we remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longerterm perspective keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the third quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and up from the prior quarter the linked quarter increase reflects broad based commercial deposit growth as well as growth from consumer stimulus payments and lower consumer spending this growth was offset by a decline in time deposits primarily related to lower interest rates growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients total interestbearing deposit costs came down basis points from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and the associated lag in pricing we would expect deposit costs to continue to decline about to basis points in the fourth quarter we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over of our total deposit mix turning to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was billion for the third quarter of compared to million a year ago and billion for the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the third quarter of compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet in the third quarter of the larger balance sheet benefited net interest income that reduced our net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows compared to the prior quarter net interest income decreased million driven by lower commercial loan balances the net interest margin was primarily impacted by continued elevated levels of liquidity elevated liquidity levels negatively impacted the margin by basis points with all other drivers netting to an additional basis point of pressure on the margin the lower than expected commercial loan balances contributed an additional basis points of margin compression recently we have received several questions about the future impact of our interest rate swap maturities on our net interest margin on slide in the appendix we provide a schedule that details maturities of our swaps also it is important to understand that this portfolio is only one of the fixed rate asset classes as all banks are impacted by maturities of fixed rate loans and investment securities we also show on this slide that our level of these assets combined as a percentage of total earning assets is in line with peers moving on to slide our feebased businesses had another strong quarter noninterest income was million for the third quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the second quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest income increased million the primary driver was an increase of million in consumer mortgage business as we continue to grow the business and see record levels of originations cards and payments income also increased million related to the prepaid card activity from the state government support programs compared to the second quarter of noninterest income decreased by million the largest driver of the quarterly decrease was million of lower operating lease income as we had gains on leveraged leases in the prior quarter which impacted the quarteroverquarter comparison consumer mortgage income was down million following a record quarter for related fees in the second quarter these were partially offset by an increase in cards and paymentsrelated income and higher service charges on deposit accounts though down quarteroverquarter investment banking and debt placement fees had another solid quarter given the volatile environment coming in at million for the quarter im now turning to slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to million last year and billion in the prior quarter the increase from the prior year is primarily related to million keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 of paymentsrelated cost reported in other expense as well as covid19related expenses to ensure the health and safety of our teammates higher personnel costs from the yearago quarter reflects lower deferred loan origination costs merit increases and higher employee benefit costs compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense increased million the increase was largely due to higher paymentsrelated costs as well as personnel costs related to elevated employee benefits primarily health care which was up million last quarter moving on to slide overall credit quality remains solid for the quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans our provision for credit losses exceeded net chargeoffs by million or per share nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans compared to million or basis points from the year ago quarter additionally delinquencies actually improved quarter overquarter with a basis point decrease in our to 89day past dues and the 90day plus category also declining quarteroverquarter we continue to monitor the level of assistance requests we receive from our customers over the past quarter the number of requests for loan forbearances have decreased dramatically as of september loans subject to forbearance were less than based on the number of accounts for both commercial and consumer loans and less than when using outstanding balances turning to slide as chris mentioned we updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are receiving greater focus in the environment these areas represent a small percentage of our total loan balances each relationship in these focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhanced monitoring importantly as a group they continue to perform consistent with our expectations turning to slide we had shared a summary of our deferrals compared to peers at a recent investor conference as shown here our deferral level was peerleading in the second quarter as noted earlier we have seen a dramatic reduction in the deferral levels during the third quarter now on to slide we have continued to maintain a strong level of capital we ended the third quarter with our common equity tier ratio of up basis points from in the second quarter this places us at the upper end of our targeted range of to we believe that this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders in the third quarter we paid a common dividend of per share which was consistent with our second quarter level importantly over the last four quarters beginning with the fourth quarter we have earned per share well above our current dividend run rate of per share on slide we have provided our outlook for the fourth quarter we expect average loans to be down lowsingle digits reflecting lower period end balances coming into the fourth quarter consumer loans should continue to grow we expect deposits to remain relatively stable core net interest income should increase lowsingle digits with a relatively stable net interest margin reflecting the expected benefit of the repayment of ppp loans the benefit of repayment is estimated to be million to million noninterest income in the fourth quarter will remain relatively stable reflecting an expected decline in consumer mortgage offset by growth in investment banking and debt placement fees keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 noninterest expense are expected to be down lowsingle digits but are highly dependent on the level of variable cost including productionrelated incentives net chargeoffs are expected to be in the to basis point range next quarter and finally as shown on the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets on a reported basis we will not achieve all the targets this year as we emerge from the pandemic and the economy strengthens we expect to be back on the path that would lead us to operate within all of our targeted ranges with that ill now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the qa portion of our call john question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and first we go to the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking my question hey lets see don maybe wanted to ask first just on the decision to stop originating indirect auto so the billion that will run off how long is it going to take for those to run up im imagining three years or less but i guess more importantly do you guys feel like you can outrun that runoff and still generate net growth for example via mortgage and laurel road where youve got strong origination outlooks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp sure scott the average life of that portfolio is about years so it will take probably in total about years before it fully runs off so we will see declines each year in those balances and chris can highlight a little bit more as far as the rationale and thoughts as far as the exit of those originations and also why were excited about the consumer loan origination capacity we can generate now so christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so scott weve talked a lot about relationships weve talked a lot about targeted scale and frankly the indirect book was from a quality perspective its just fine from a return perspective obviously you cant generate the kind of relationship returns that we would expect because its a single product keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 conversely as you look at our consumer business as you well know two years ago we really didnt have a mortgage business this year we were able originate more than billion two years ago we didnt have our laurel road business this year well generate more than billion and we have big plans obviously to continue to grow both of those so the premise of your question do we think we can outrun it in our consumer business we do and we think we can do it on a relationship basis and really use our capital to support our clients or for other things whether its stock buybacks or whatever that we think are better use of capital r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thank you very much i appreciate that and then separately just sort of a top level question now that sort of coming out of the worst of the pandemic a lot of banks tend to be kind of applying lessons learned from ability to operate without the same sort of infrastructure just curious how you guys are thinking about the branch footprint if you might see any opportunities for something broader to do on the cost side here as we sort of stare down a challenging revenue environment for the next couple of years christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure scott we think the pandemic certainly accelerated some trends that were already there just to give you some texture when we bought first niagara we had branches today we have weve invested heavily in digital our digital takeup more than of our customers are now digitally active and so we actually think there is a significant opportunity to take a look at the fleet and were in the final throes of planning that and well have more to say on that in january but in addition to some other things that are fundamental changes we do think therell be a change in kind of how we look at the density of our branches and as you know were in some fastgrowing areas where we have relatively thin branch footprints and we think we can replicate that and get the mix right of digital and physical in other parts of our franchise r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right so i guess well sort of stay tuned till january on that so donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp good r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right well thank you i appreciate it operator our question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 hey thanks don you mentioned that you expect the million to million of ppp accelerated amortization in fourth quarter i think youre actually one of the only banks that ive heard so far at least thats building that in i think most are looking at first quarter has the sba actually opened up the portal or the forgiveness portal and are they approving loans or is this sort of a question mark in terms of whether or not it actually goes into fourth quarter or not based on the sba donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp we were hearing earlier that several other banks were using the same type of assumptions if not even more aggressive as far as their prepayment but the sba has opened weve actually started to see some of the requests from customers go through and actually get funded here recently too so it still is more of a trickle but were starting to see volumes and activity levels pick up and thats what gives us the basis for our outlook ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats great and then the other question i had i guess what are you guys planning to do with the excess liquidity on the balance sheet like how quickly can you deploy do you want to deploy it where is it going into thanks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yeah weve been looking at all different kinds of uses of that and whether or not we can put it to better use than just sitting in cash our challenge right now is is that we tend to keep a fairly conservative investment portfolio and really dont want to venture into credit risk in that area and so the returns on similar type of agency securities that we would invest in are right around basis points and so well continue to assess that to see if we lean into that a little bit more i would say that we on a trial basis started to do buy some longerdated assets and put some forward starting swaps against that that well convert that asset to a variable rate say five years down the road which is better aligned with our overall strategy and risk profile and so well consider doing things like that but near term i think we will continue to see elevated levels of liquidity including cash and treasury bills just because we feel that thats more prudent for us to do in this environment ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator and next well go to erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc my first question is for you don i think that investor conversations have turned from simply credit to thinking about banks on a normalized return basis and so as i think about the progression of net interest income from that billion so if we exclude any ppp impact im wondering if you could help us in terms of the walk to what the quarterly run rate could look like in exppp because obviously the runoff of the indirect portfolio is new news versus your high cash levels that ken just mentioned that you could possibly redeploy versus i think theres a million swing in hedge income contribution from this quarter to perhaps fourth quarter of so any help you can give in terms of how we think about where your net interest income could bottom and of course not assuming any loan growth or any changes in the rate environment donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yeah well provide more specifics on in january i would say that as far as some of the moving parts that youre right that our swap portfolio will continue to mature over time i would say that as we highlight on slide that there a number of fixed rate type of asset classes including the swaps the loan portfolio and also the investment portfolio and i would say that as we look at how were positioned compared to others we think that were right in line with peers as far as that relative mix as far as fixed rate assets as we look at going forward we think that our margin will probably bottom out something fairly close to where were at today with over time having a redeployment of some of that liquidity into other loan categories whether its consumer or at some point in time seeing some commercial loan growth back up again and so the pressure from these rates and the impact on the maturity and the rollover of those fixed rate asset classes would be offset by the utilization of some of those liquidity sources and so that would include in that outlook some prepayment of those ppp loans erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just a followup question and maybe this one this is for chris clearly was an exceptional year as we think about and you sort of teased out a potential announcement and are thinking about infrastructure and branches for january if you weigh the revenue headwinds with efficiency opportunities do you think keycorp can get back on positive operating leverage track next year christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 i do i do and continuous improvement erika is part of our culture each year weve taken out sort of to and used that as raw material to invest and we will continue to do that i think theres some fundamental changes in the way banking is done and i am confident in both the trajectory of our earnings streams and also our ability to manage our expenses we do have kind of a unique situation this quarter in that half of the yearoveryear increase is attributable to prepaid cards im not saying that thats completely nonrecurring but i will say that weve invested a bunch of time energy people and technology to tamp that down so the answer your question is yes erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator and next well go to the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp morning matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i just wanted to follow up on the exit of the indirect auto i mean its not that big of a deal but its also a portfolio that youve been growing i think pretty nicely just in the past years here i think that was kind of one of the strategic additions you got from first niagara so im just wondering like has something changed in the marketplace in the last i dont know three or six months or maybe just elaborate on kind of the timing now especially at a time when theres just not a lot of loan growth for the industry overall christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so matt the real timing as weve now successfully from a standing start built the laurel road platform and our mortgage platform we acquired first niagara in we really didnt have an engine for consumer loans and it was a good bridge it being indirect auto was a good bridge but weve always stayed pretty true to the notion that were a relationship bank and were focused on targeted scale where we can be relevant and as we look at that portfolio in conjunction with the returns it just didnt achieve what we wanted it to do visàvis investing our capital elsewhere now in terms of anything changing in the market this isnt what drove the decision but as you know the automobile market right now is very hot our analyst thinks that sales at retail next year will be up like the keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 value of used vehicles right now because of shutdowns due to covid19 are up or thats not what drove the decision but that is a fundamental macro driver thats out there matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i understand how mortgage is a relationship product but just remind us on laurel road how youve transformed that into more of a relationship product versus kind of a oneoff christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so this is something that were frankly very excited about were building a national digital bank and its going to be focused on health care professionals and so weve already obviously built the loan consolidation business thats all digital then in many cases within six months something like of those customers that refinance their doctor and dental school loans buy a home weve now built a complete digital mortgage application and where we can take it from there is on a national basis to be really focused matt around doctors and dentists in terms of opening accounts et cetera and that will open up then the opportunity for us in the case of dentists most because theyre mostly independent business people as opposed to doctors who are part of large groups that will give us an avenue to do a lot with them so we see laurel road as a platform that weve grown a lot its achieved everything we hoped it would and we think theres a lot to do on top of it and then one other area where we could potentially focus is expand beyond doctors and dentists but within health care health care as you know is of the gdp going to kind of trillion going to trillion so thats how were thinking about it matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you thanks operator operator instructions and next well go to gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning chris good morning don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 can you guys share with us i think you mentioned on the call that youre at the top end of your capital guidelines of we know the share repurchase programs have been temporarily suspended by the federal reserve at least through the end of the year can you share with us your thinking of share repurchases for and where youd like to bring that capital ratio down to and because the change in the stress test where the fed does not approve any longer a banks plan to buy back stock or pay a dividend as long as you surpass the required minimal capital ratio youve got the latitude or the optionality to kind of do the buyback the way you see fit so could you give us some thoughts on could you ever consider a dutch auction if this suspension goes into the second half of next year and your capital ratios in the high to do one big buyback at one time to bring down the capital ratio donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp gerard this is don and as far as the share repurchases we feel very good about where our capital position is today i would say to your point that we would expect that the capital ratio is to continue to increase as long as were not buying back shares and so we highlighted that we are up basis points as far as the consideration for when we would be back in to buy shares that wed want to have a little bit better clarity as far as the clear direction on the economy and where thats heading and making sure that we continue to have the capital to support our customers support our organic growth and continue to support the dividend and so those will be priorities for us above just the share buyback one other potential consideration is that with the impact of the cecl accounting change and how it impacts our capital ratios theres about a basis point or so impact that well see over time there as well but we do feel very good about where were at from a capital perspective we do believe that it will increase and if available and things allow and permit we could consider adjustments that would allow us to probably more proactively manage that overall share count with either a large share repurchase program or market purchases like weve done in the past gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then circling back to credit obviously key in the past has had issues with credit during a recession and i know its been a goal of management to prove to investors thats not going to be the case in this cycle if we exclude for a moment the change in mix of your portfolio today versus what it was like in and you take a look at obviously the government fiscal programs that have been implemented to help people through this downturn what are you guys seeing today that really strikes you as different than what youve seen in the past on the behaviors of your borrowers donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yeah keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp deleveraging donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp maybe ill go ahead and start gerard and chris and mark might have some thoughts to add to that but i would say that the biggest difference that i would see and this is just coming in midstream in this but key really has pivoted to a relationship strategy and if you take a look at where the portfolio was before the last crisis that it was more transactionoriented as opposed to relationship and so weve had outsized exposure in some commercial real estate developers and it was more on the project as opposed to an ongoing steady stream of cash flow for us and so id say that the migration to that relationship strategy is having a huge payback for us on the consumer side were following similar trends its a very high quality very consistent portfolio and as we talked earlier we really want to continue to have that more on a relationshiptype of approach as opposed to transaction i dont know chris will you add to that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp what i would add its been a 10year journey after the financial crisis we sat down and evaluated where we lost money how we lost money and that we basically it was principally in real estate it was projectlevel real estate it was where we didnt have a deep relationship in some cases it was business that was indirect business third party business and we went about the business of derisking our portfolio and we have been disciplined enough that we have foregone revenues such that we could position ourselves so we have the capital and the ability to support our clients and targeted prospects in an environment like this the other thing i would just remind everyone of is of the capital we raise for our customers gerard only of it goes onto our balance sheet and so that too is something that i think is unique for us and that we can serve our clients without necessarily putting it on our balance sheet but youre exactly right its been a long journey gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thanks gerard operator our next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning chris and don thanks for the disclosures on slide i wanted to ask about the hedging program runoff on the bottom righthand side of the slide is the right way to read this chart that if we keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 multiply the weighted average yield by the notional value of the on and offbalance sheet hedges we get the quarterly contribution from the hedging program and if so it looks like the declining hedging benefit would translate into a million headwind in and million headwind in is that the right thought process donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp i would say that this assumes that we have no replacement of the swaps going forward so this is just a runoff of the existing book and so depending upon where the yield curve moves and how that would reposition we could see some differences there and then also would assume that were taking no other actions onbalance sheet to minimize or mitigate some of that impact bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and if i may just as a followup so beyond the hedging portfolio runoff can you discuss a little bit maybe just some color on the front book back book dynamics if the low rate environment persists maybe just give us a sense of how much youre receiving in paydowns of back book loans and securities that would have to get redeployed and what the yield differential is between new money rates now and whats coming off donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp sure can but generally our loan portfolio has an average life of about three years and so just to use that as a proxy for the kind of rolloff that we would have on the portfolio and repricing if you take a look at our ci and most of our commercial portfolios they tend to be liborbased id say that the spreads on new originations are fairly consistent overall with what the back book would have and not seeing a lot of change in that overall repricing for that portfolio we have seen a little bit more acceptance of some floors that are being placed on the products and so that will be helpful for us going forward but that book as a general rule doesnt have a lot of repricing or risk from that perspective if you look at some of the fixed rate portfolios residential mortgage its a fairly new portfolio for us we are seeing growth there that i think that the current yield on that portfolio onbalance sheet is around a or so as far as residential mortgage current production is closer to a kind of overall yield for that portfolio so a little bit below current average rates but not significantly different as far as some of the other consumer categories whether its home equity or laurel road student loans or some of the other categories were looking at probably about a 80basispointorso gap between what the existing portfolio is compared to what the legacy book is on that side for the investment portfolio that for the core portfolio excluding the treasury bills that weve been adding as far as some of the excess liquidity position were seeing a rolloff of those yields around a and a replacement yield of around so about basis points of shift there keep in mind too that as we highlighted on the deposit side were expecting to see our average interestbearing cost of deposits decrease by to basis points in the fourth quarter and we should see some additional opportunities for benefit there going forward as well and so probably at a slower pace but still helping to offset or minimize some of the exposure there keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc its super helpful thank you for all the additional details donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator and next well go to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys i was wondering if you can dig in a little bit more on the outlook for loans so obviously not surprising to see the declines this quarter from the paydowns and you mentioned that loans will continue to ph detract going forward a little bit but what do you see in terms of just any change in improvement in activity on the manufacturing side on inventory et cetera that we might look forward and start to see a point of stabilization some others are even pointing to growth so just your broader outlook on the potential inflection in loans thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure ken its chris good morning so theres no question that as we look at our ci book the utilization is below where we would have thought it would be right now its frankly below the beginning of the covid19 crisis i think theres a few things that can serve as a driver to loan growth on the ci side one is an inventory rebuild and as the economy ramps up i mean state the obvious as the economy ramps down these companies throw off a lot of cash as it ramps up they consume cash i think that could give us an opportunity as well the other thing that is going on ma discussions in the beginning of the second quarter were nonexistent as we look at what are the discussions were having with our customers day in and day out i think people are really starting you wont see it in the fourth quarter but people are really starting to think strategically just this week i met with three clients and theyre in areas that you would think they might still be hunkered down and they are really starting to think strategically so i think the levers on the ci book will be transactional but even before transactional id like to see obviously some greater utilization i think those are a couple of opportunities ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then on the followup to that on the corporate activity side just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the pipeline for investment banking and what the mix of investment banking has been in terms of like the public versus private and cre markets like is any of that kind of back to a normal or still have good pipelines ahead if you could fill that in too christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so as we look forward i would describe the pipelines as solid the real variable was our ma business which is a strong business which basically was nonexistent as i mentioned kind of in the second quarter our keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 backlogs now ken in ma are equal to what they were going into the crisis and obviously a lot of deals went away so i find that to be encouraging as i look at our fees this quarter we were about at million we i believe will be up in the fourth quarter i dont think it will be at the record kind of weve been weve had million quarters before i dont think well be at million but well certainly be somewhere between million and million the pipelines are solid the real estate commercial mortgage business obviously in this rate environment continues to be pretty strong ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks chris operator and next well go to john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc morning donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc i wanted to see if we can get some incremental color on risk migration this quarter with the increase in your criticized assets just want to see if you can give us a little bit of the granularity on what drove that migration and what asset types and then also is that increase in criticized reflected at this point in your existing loan loss reserve thanks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp sure ill go ahead and answer the last part of that question first and then mark can help provide some of the clarity as far as the migration but as far as our loan loss reserve that we established at june and now at september keep in mind under cecl that youre looking for the life of loan type of losses and so embedded in there is the assumption that youre going to see migration into criticized and classified and increased losses throughout the next several quarters and so those were all baked into both june and september if we look at where were at today whether its criticized classified chargeoffs and nonperforming were actually better at september than what our models would have assumed as of june for this first quarter of that time period and so were actually seeing better credit quality migration than would have been expected and contemplated as part of our june reserves mark ph can cover the areas of that migration keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 mark w midkiff a chief risk officer keycorp yes id echo that don better than what we would have forecasted on the migration and the drivers really are the same things youre seeing in the focus areas in the disclosure so the consumer businesses so consumer discretionary consumer services the oil and gas business some transportation so its really those are the drivers that we see john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thanks and then another question just on credit it sounds like youre confident in the adequacy of where the reserve stands now so if chargeoffs continue to rise as they did this quarter for the fourth quarter and beyond would you expect that you would underprovide for those chargeoffs donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp weve talked before about how the cecl works and really theres three drivers to it one is whats the economic outlook and so i would hesitate to try to speculate or guess as to what that will be as of december given the environment that were in and given how election is right around the corner as well but that will clearly impact the overall reserve levels and if i look at between the second quarter and the third quarter assumption sets what we saw as far as that economic outlook was that probably a better nearterm performance was actually realized in the september summary than what we would have assumed in the june summary but longer term the recovery rate was a little slower so unemployment levels remained a little bit higher in our september and gdp level and recovery was a little slower than what we would have assumed and so generally maybe a little bit slight negative as far as the overall impact there and so first is economic outlook second would be migration of the portfolio that as we just talked about that our loss models that are used for cecl will assume that the portfolio goes through a specific migration based on the economic outlook and so if you perform better or worse than that migration you would see a need to either increase or decrease the reserves and then the third would be is that new loan production and as we highlighted last quarter on the call normally for loan production that would imply a provision expense of million to million a quarter versus the million that we had this quarter and so thats elevated compared to what we normally would have expected as far as just matching the loan production this quarter what we did do was to actually supplement what our quantitative models would have produced and so we added about million between model overlays and also our qualitative assessment to the reserve to bump up the reserves just to make sure that we werent recognizing too quickly the benefit of that migration and given the economic uncertainty that were still facing right now and so we think that was a prudent thing for us to do and we would have seen a lower level of provision if we had not had done that this quarter john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks don thats very helpful keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 operator our next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just in simple terms why did you guys build reserves this quarter when many of your peers didnt and where do you think chargeoffs basis points in the third quarter peak and when do you think that happens donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp sure as far as the build in the reserve id say its fairly modest and what we wanted to do was to make sure that we werent taking credit too early as far as the better than expected migration and also uncertainty on the overall economic outlook and so we felt that was appropriate to do last quarter we were being challenged as to whether or not our reserves were adequate and we still are a little low compared to peers as far as the reserves and so that also influenced our assessment as to whether or not we wanted to show reserve declines this quarter and so we decided to go ahead and layer in on top of that some additional model overlays and also qualitative reserves and so if you look at our total allowance for credit losses mike its at and if our average loan life is roughly three years that would imply chargeoffs of around basis points for some time and i would say that as we take a look at what our projections would have wed probably see some continued slight increases through the middle of next year and that would probably be the peak and then start to trail off again mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so the peak would be like double or or basis points or any i mean i know not many have given this but some have donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yeah i would say that it would be elevated a little bit from the basis points and were talking about to basis points next quarter so they go up a little bit from there yes but probably not a doubling from here mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then the tougher question so of your loans are in forbearance and you said thats down significantly i guess thats commercial consumer if the music were to stop today because at some point youll stop with the forbearance what would be the impact on chargeoffs and revenues donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp as far as chargeoffs i mean one weve already built in extra reserves for those loans that are in forbearance and so i think thats an appropriate consideration there two if we look at the forbearance and especially on the commercial side were not just automatically granting forbearance weve got to work with the customer and make sure that we understand that this truly is a bridge for them on an interim basis and this isnt just a delay of the inevitable and so we are taking a look at credit quality without the benefit of that forbearance keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 i would say that on the consumer side even though we have loans in forbearance were still very happy with the quality of that underlying customer base that still have consumers that will eventually have the capacity to continue to repay that the collateral values for those products whether its home equity or residential mortgage are still quite strong and so i wouldnt see that as a significant impact as far as either chargeoffs or pl for us as those would mature mark i dont know ph if you have any thoughts here mark w midkiff a chief risk officer keycorp yeah id say the same and they do continue to come down and we also what rolls off of and exits were seeing really high current rates sort of or higher so seeing good performance mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if i can just squeeze in one more chris acquisitions bank acquisitions the environment i mean competitors are under pressure the industry is a little under pressure whats the appetite christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so as you know weve been successful in acquiring niche businesses and i think you can expect us to continue to look at those im really proud of the fact that weve been able to acquire born digital companies and successfully integrate those investment banking boutiques and integrate those in terms of wholebank acquisitions thats not really a focus of ours mike we think we have everything we need to be successful and we think the right strategy is to execute our strategy to create value for the shareholders mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator our final question will be from steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is janet lee on steve of the million quarteroverquarter increase in card and payment income this quarter what percentage of that is from the prepaid card activity supporting state government programs that is going to start winding down in and also can you comment on the level of organic spending and transaction volumes during the quarter excluding the prepaid card activity thanks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 sure can as far as the percentage increase i would say the majority of the increase in that cards and payments related revenues was related to the prepaid card activity keep in mind also that we saw a similar increase in the expenses linked quarter and so the earnings risk for that is nominal as far as changes on that front as far as the activity for other card balances that i would say that in the third quarter were seeing levels that are fairly comparable to what we would have seen as far as spend on both the credit card and debit card and maybe transaction counts might be a little lower on debit card but the average ticket size is a little higher and so were seeing getting closer to return to normal i dont know chris if you have any other thoughts there christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp no obviously the mix has changed a bit there as people arent traveling people arent going to restaurants but in the third quarter it actually the spend eclipsed that of the third quarter of last year janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thats helpful and my followup is on the deferral on your billion loans on deferral how much of that is on loans and covid19exposed categories and which industry are you seeing the highest redeferral rates thanks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp mark do you have thoughts on that as far as i would say generally that were seeing a higher percentage in those industries but i dont know that theres any one indiscernible mark w midkiff a chief risk officer keycorp not one that kind of stands out and the redeferral rates are its been in the kind of range so its been very very low janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thats helpful thank you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator and we will take another question from the line of saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc thanks thanks for squeezing me in a couple followups first here on the prepaid card income you just mentioned the majority of the increase or almost all the increase cadence comes from that and the payments is it fair to say that it seems like your guidance for fourth quarter still includes pretty elevated level of prepaid keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 income and associated expenses is that correct and can you just help us understand what kind of magnitude is sort of baked into the fourth quarter donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp i would say both the revenues and expenses remain elevated compared to normal levels but down slightly from what we would have seen in the third quarter and so saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp theres a number of different things would drive both the revenue and expenses and were seeing some of the activity levels for those areas declined slightly in our outlook saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it and secondly i wanted to go back to the earlier question on hedges i want to clear if you blessed bill carcaches math or not but based on that can you just help us understand what is the sort of nii protection that youre currently getting from your swap just doing the math on slide seems like its in the neighborhood of about call it million or say million a quarter with a weighted average maturity of years so i guess it rolls off over six seven years which would imply sort of ph million to million headwind annually from just and i know this is assuming no replacements and no other stuff you can do to offset it but i mean is that math broadly correct that thats kind of the protection youre getting today and the runoff will provide something close to say million million million headwind annually or is that completely off donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp well keep in mind that as we look at our loan portfolio 70plus is variable thats different than many of our peers and so if you look at the swap book that we have it really is to shift the actual net adjusted position to be more in line with peers as far as that overall fixed percentage i would say as far as the math i think were right around basis points of our margin this quarter relates to the benefit from interest rate swaps and so the math probably isnt too far off id have to go back and recalculate all the numbers to make sure that were in sync there but that is if you just look at that one light item would be correct but keep in mind that we were also seeing a corresponding reduction in our net interest income coming from those commercial loans that are liborbased that we use these to hedge that impact and so its difficult to say just looking at that one line item whats the impact but you have to look at the overall balance sheet and the moves on not only the asset side but the liability side to see the true impact is going forward keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it all right thats super helpful thank you very much donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator and with that ill turn
