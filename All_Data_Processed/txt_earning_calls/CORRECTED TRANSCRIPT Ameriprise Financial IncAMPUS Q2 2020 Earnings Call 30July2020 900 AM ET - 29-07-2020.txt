exceptionally well im very proud of our team how well were operating during this time and the results were generating clearly the feds decision to lower interest rates in march and the volatility in the equity markets affected our business in the second quarter markets will continue to experience a level of volatility based on the shape of the recovery but we are wellpositioned to manage through this uncertainty today ill provide an update on our second quarter results and how the business is performing importantly i will discuss these results in the context of the key themes and longterm priorities that we spoke to you about at our investor day presentation in november first further strengthening our position as a leading wealth manager with a great reputation compelling capabilities and deep client relationships second continuing to transform our global asset management business to meet client needs for active management evidenced by our net inflows in the quarter third managing our insurance and annuity books of business thoughtfully and strategically and finally were driving shareholder value through our combination of businesses free cash flow and capital management our financial strength positions us well to continue managing ongoing volatility and economic uncertainty our balance sheet and liquidity are very strong and we generate a high return for shareholders as i reflect on the quarter and the first half of the year i feel good about our strategic direction how were executing and the results were generating were focused on our clients and delivering good organic growth in client flows were navigating this climate well regarding financials on an adjusted operating basis ex auto home net revenues were billion down compared to last year reflecting significant pressure from interest rates and lower average equity markets that i highlighted for the quarter adjusted operating eps was and was substantially impacted by the reversal of the tax benefit realized in the first quarter and the fed cuts excluding these items eps growth would have been and roe was which remains among the best in the industry as you review our financial results youll see that we were able to mitigate some of the revenue pressure through good expense management and strong capital management in fact adjusted for the impact of the tax item eps growth is good and our roe is near the top of the industry and our assets under management and administration ended the quarter at billion up reflecting strong client flows and pointtopoint market appreciation ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 now ill discuss advice wealth management where were delivering good growth in assets and flows and absorbing market pressure as well total client assets were up to billion in the quarter we had strong client flows with nearly billion in wrap net inflows which is consistent with our strong start to the year and very good when considering the volatility and unease in the markets clients brokerage cash balances remain high but came down a bit on a sequential basis as clients started putting money back to work as markets stabilized our goalbased value proposition is resonating with clients as they navigate these markets were seeing good uptake in foundational advice and much greater use of our digital capabilities including online gold tracking and record engagement on our websites and mobile apps in fact site visits are up over last year and traffic to the ameriprise app increased and clients are highly satisfied with the ameriprise advice experience say their advisor provided advice that addressed their needs and that they were highly satisfied with the outcome of their experience with their advisor say they are likely to recommend the experience to friends or family additionally our crm platform is an important component of the ameriprise client experience particularly in this remote working environment as advisors leverage these capabilities to track and act on client data and activity we consistently invested in our technology which is leading to continued strong client satisfaction engagement and growth in advisor productivity in fact net revenue per advisor increased which is quite good considering the weight of low interest rates on the business as well as lower average equity markets and the change in methodology of billing based on beginning of the month asset levels on the recruiting front we welcomed productive advisors to the firm in the quarter across all our channels advisor movement in the industry slowed considerably in april due to market dislocation we quickly moved to an allvirtual recruiting program and activity picked up in may and june many advisors have more time to evaluate options and theyre taking advantage of our video sessions webinars virtual vip meetings and open houses to get to know ameriprise it is a very efficient way to showcase our effective advisor value proposition these experienced highly productive advisors are attracted to our clientfirst culture and theyve been particularly impressed with our technology as well as how weve been supporting our advisors during a challenging time were very wellpositioned on the recruiting front and the pipeline looks good with regard to ameriprise bank this is an important growth area for us that we continue to ramp up were beginning to invest out the cash that we move to the bank were also building out our capabilities we just launched our mortgage product in july and we will be rolling out our pledge loan capability in the fourth quarter so in terms of awm financials margins remain quite strong at nearly and thats after the significant impact of the fed interest rate reduction weve consistently had strong sustained margins in awm that compares very favorably to peers and that remains true today and as we grow the business we are closely managing expenses given the revenue environment while still investing to drive future growth in insurance annuities weve been very deliberate in how were managing these businesses weve adjusted our products features and pricing consistent with our risk management approach and the environment in annuities total variable annuities sales were down reflecting client concerns about the pandemic and market volatility as well as the mix shift we are driving we continue to see very good uptake of our structured annuity we launched earlier this year when you combine these sales with our flagship rava va product more than ph of new riversource annuity sales in the quarter were in products without living benefit guarantees as we progress through the year we should increase even further consistent with our plan id also add that due to the rate environment we stopped new sales of fixed and fixed index annuities in protection life sales were also down however weve been focused on shifting from iul to vul where we have been a leader vul sales were stable and the decline was in iul as with our variable annuities we ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 continue to make pricing and benefit adjustments including cap rate reductions and adjustments to our underwriting as appropriate like others we have seen a slowdown in longdated products and were working hard to help advisors serve their clients and grow their books with insurance and annuity solutions in this largely virtual world overall we will continue to manage this business prudently and it continues to be a good source of free cash flow moving to asset management we had a good quarter that reflects the momentum in the business that weve been building and discussing with you the trends in the business are quite positive especially in north america at the end of the second quarter aum was billion up from a year ago even after reflecting lower weighted equity markets it was also up sequentially reflecting the recovery in the us equity markets in the quarter and our improved flow picture our aum growth was driven by our north america business we are generating good earnings in asset management and while pretax adjusted operating earnings were down that was largely due to lower performance fees and lower average equity markets compared to a year ago the success were driving in our flows is a result of our focus and progress in a number of key areas first and foremost our strong investment performance our short and longerterm equity performance has remained strong through this volatile period with around of our funds above medium or beating benchmarks on an asset weighted basis performance is especially good in key strategies like incomeoriented equities an asset class that we believe will continue to be critical for years to come and in fixed income we saw a bounce back from underperformance in march that impacted shortterm numbers longterm numbers across equities fixed income and asset allocation remain strong in both the us and emea in addition to good investment performance were concentrating even more on strategies that align with investor needs and also improve the effectiveness of our distribution columbia threadneedle was in net inflows in may and june and ended the quarter with billion in net inflows for the quarter a more than billion improvement from a year ago this is a nice continuation of the improving trends that weve seen over the last year regarding global retail net inflows north america retail was in net inflows of billion exparent with million of outflows in emea us retail had very good results across distribution channels including large broker dealer firms independents and dcio were generating good results from our effective segmentation and targeting as well as the benefits of our data strategy in fact north america was in net inflows in four of the first six months of the year led by strong flows in equity income and complemented by certain fixed income asset allocation and other strategies in addition to these north america retail inflows i spoke about we continue to build out our model delivery business and had million of assets under administration flows in the quarter in emea retail we were in net outflows as the equity market environment there is more challenging and investors remain cautious that said overall flows improved nicely from a year ago particularly in key markets including the uk germany and italy and in global institutional excluding former parent assets we had net inflows of million a nice improvement from last year and that includes outflows of million of low fee assets from an insurance client that we expected we were able to offset that by winning higher fee mandates including improved traction in asia and with nice diversity across equity and fixed income key to these strong results is our excellent virtual engagement with intermediary and institutional clients that reflects the benefits of the technology investments that weve made across the firm going forward our teams will operate using both inperson and virtual engagements which should further improve efficiency and cost of acquisition so to wrap up asset management were delivering good results and improving trends and the team is focused on continuing our progress going forward ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 now lets turn to our ability to return capital to shareholders which is underpinned by excellent free cash flow generation and balance sheet strength the business continues to generate good free cash flow that we invest for future growth and return to shareholders our balance sheet remains very strong with approximately billion sic billion of liquidity that we held at high levels since increasing it early in the year given the volatility in the market and economic uncertainty excess capital remains strong at billion and as we have noted we have a highquality diversified investment portfolio with an average rating of aa and limited exposure to industries that are currently under pressure and we restarted our buyback program in may reflecting the strength of our free cash flow generation and capital position in closing we continue to focus on our clients and helping them navigate this environment as ive discussed were getting good traction in advice wealth management and the trends in asset management are positive overall the company remains strong and were able to return to shareholders at a differentiated level through an increase in our dividend and restarting our share repurchases regarding our team while the vast majority of our employees and advisors continue to work from home during the second quarter we have begun to gradually initiate a return to office as you expect were taking a thoughtful phased approach were beginning to open a number of corporate sites and our branches and franchise offices around the us are starting to reopen safely throughout this period our top priorities have been serving our clients as well as the health and safety of the ameriprise team our people are collaborating well and are highly engaged and its getting noticed im pleased that we were named once again as a best place to work by the minneapolisst paul business journal i feel good about how were executing and operating through this pandemic uncertainty remains in the environment but were very wellpositioned now ill turn it over to walter and then ill take your questions walter stanley berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim as you are aware we are operating in a challenging environment with interest rates equity market volatility and a pandemic continuing to create significant headwinds ameriprise delivered adjusted operating eps of in the quarter as strong underlying business performance was negatively impacted by from the reversal of the first quarter tax benefit and the full impact of the federal reserve cuts in march strong momentum in flows continued in the quarter with nearly billion of wrap net flows and over billion of net inflows in asset management balance sheet and risk fundamentals remain strong we have successfully maintained strong engagement with clients advisors and sales teams to deliver exceptional service while nearly of our workforce continues to work remotely excess capital ended the quarter strong at billion as we continue to generate substantial free cash flow lets turn to page the market dislocation in march related to covid19 continue to adversely impact financial performance we realized the full impact of the fed rate cuts in march as well as a lower average equity market additionally reduced sales in longerdated insurance and annuity products negatively impacted transaction activity in the quarter our underlying business trends remain solid in the second quarter flows were very strong in both wealth management and asset management were managing expenses very tightly in this environment and we have returned nearly of earnings to shareholders so far this year after resuming our share repurchase program in may lets turn to page as we continue to navigate this operating environment balance sheet strength and risk management foundation will remain keys to our success we ended the quarter with billion of excess capital and substantial liquidity yeartodate we have generated free cash flow of nearly of earnings our ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 investment portfolio continues to remain defensively positioned and performed well in the quarter we are currently in a billion unrealized gain and less than million of impairments and loan reserves in the quarter we continue to manage the business prudently from a risk perspective with effective hedging and as you would expect were making appropriate product changes to address the interest rate environment from an operational risk perspective we continue to meet client and advisor needs while ensuring the safety of our employees and our business has performed well during the pandemic as demonstrated by flows in wealth management and asset management life mortality remains stable despite the pandemic reflecting the unique characteristics of our client base and approximately of our block is reinsured in the quarter our closed ltc blocks were fewer clients entering nursing homes and increased mortalityrelated terminations from clients on claims as you can see on page financial results were clearly impacted by headwinds from rates markets and client behavioral changes related to the pandemic advice wealth management adjusted operating net revenues declined absorbing the expected million impact of lower revenue from the precipitous decline in short term interest rates as well as million from lower transactional activities associated with the pandemic and million from lower average equity markets we are navigating this market environment as we have demonstrated during previous downturns importantly organic growth remains strong with solid client flows including nearly billion of wrap net flows growth in wrap assets and improved advisor productivity and as jim has mentioned advisor recruiting in the quarter was very good and that momentum continues these business metric trends will continue to support good organic growth as we move through this uncertain period revenue in the quarter did not fully reflect the growth in wrap assets because of our methodology of billings based upon beginning of the month assets while markets were down on average the impact of markets based upon our billing implies an impact of markets being down on average as a result equity market appreciation in the second quarter will benefit third quarter revenues expenses were wellmanaged in the quarter down ga expenses increased in line with expectations as we continue to invest for future growth where appropriate including the bank excluding the bank ga expenses were down we will continue to prudently manage our expense base and adjust accordingly based upon the environment pretax adjusted operating margin was in the quarter a strong result in this environment turning to page asset management delivered strong net inflows a continuation of the favorable trends over the past several quarters we remain optimistic in our continued traction on flows and favorable fee mix shift we will continue to leverage global operational capabilities and provide diverse product offerings with strong investment performance we are encouraged by the progress the business is making and how that will contribute to revenues over time adjusted operating revenues decreased as billion of net inflows partially mitigated the impact of lower average equity markets lower performance fees and the impact of net outflows from prior quarters adjusted operating expenses improved ga expenses declined reflecting disciplined expense management with reengineering initiatives funding targeted investments for growth pretax adjusted margin remains strong at turning to page annuities and protection results continue to perform in line with expectations in this market environment variable annuity pretax adjusted operating earnings increased million to million primarily as a result of lower surrenders and withdrawals that reduce the amortization of deferred acquisition cost as well ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 as lower sales and higher ending market levels fixed annuity pretax adjusted operating earnings were million reflecting continued lower interest rates and net outflows protection continued to deliver stable earnings during the quarter at million reflecting favorable claims while variable annuity sales declined overall were seeing the desired mix shift in sales to products without living benefit guarantees we recently launched our structured variable annuity product and over half of variable annuity sales during the quarter were those without living benefit guarantees we expect this trend to continue additionally we discontinued new sales of proprietary fixed annuities and fixed index annuities given the low interest rate environment now lets move to the balance sheet on slide ive already highlighted many of the elements of our balance sheet fundamentals our strong liquidity position substantial excess capital effective hedging and a defensive positioned investment portfolio our adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remains strong at we resumed buyback in early may and through the first half of the year have returned nearly of earnings to shareholders with that we will take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instruction and our first question comes from erik bass with autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp hi thank you was hoping you could provide some more color on the outlook for expenses in the advice wealth segment and are you making any adjustments to the plan you talked about previously given the revenue headwinds in the business walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes this is walter so let me jim you want to do it james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no go ahead walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so if you look at our expenses we are targeting right now for am totally to be down about million year overyear and when you consider that normally you have volume increases and certainly investments being made thats a substantial savings of over million and so weve looked at the situation we have evaluated it and weve put that in play as it relates to awm we are certainly continuing to invest for growth but we will still monitor the situation as it relates to the revenue generation and keep in proportion certainly looking at the expenses that we have so the answer is we are and we have implemented programs ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp got it i mean i guess does that imply that expenses or ga ex the bank could continue to be down yearover year walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes you should expect that they will certainly track and be level or down as we move into the balance of the year period yes erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp thank you and then just two quick things for annuities you mentioned the favorable benefit from dac amortization this quarter so just hoping you could help us think about the earnings run rate for that business going forward and then does the decision to stop selling fixed annuities have any implications for how youre thinking about the inforce block walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well okay so let me start with the latter on the fixed annuities we decided because we felt from a standpoint it was not meeting our shareholder objectives and we certainly have other products that are available and we still intend to pursue reinsurance of the fixed annuity block as situations evolve so from that standpoint i think its totally in line with the objectives that weve said before on the va certainly we have seen our lapses improve from that standpoint and that was part of the benefit but we also had the big lift relating to the equity markets and a shortfall in sales so as sales improve we will see some ph denigration but we certainly we think that we got a lift in this quarter because of those items and we should be back to a more moderate pattern as we go into the third quarter and the fourth quarter but still a very good performance erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp got it so should we sort of average the first two quarters of the year to sort of think about the run rate would that be reasonable walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc actually its yes indiscernible were approaching it but its probably going to be in that range yeah erik bass q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc youre welcome ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 operator our following question comes from suneet kamath with citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning just sticking with advice wealth management first on the transactional revenues i guess down i think you said million versus last year can you just talk about what the strategies are in terms of trying to turn that around does it require sort of new products that are more competitive or just whats the strategy behind that walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so ill comment jim im going to james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc first obviously in this quarter its very difficult to sell some of the longdated products when youre not faceto face and so theyre adjusting on that so certainly that has caused a bit of a dislocation as it relates to the ability and certainly the environment as people see this sort of environment they pause so as it relates to products we are adjusting the products for the environment and certainly weve launched a new structured product which seems to be doing very well and meeting our expectations so i think its a combination of that jim i dont know if you want to add anything on that james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah suneet i think as you would imagine after the tremendous market volatility and market depreciation that occurred at the end of the first quarter and then moving to virtual advisors were very much focused on engaging clients keeping them on track to what they needed to achieve longerterm managing their various portfolios and having types of conversations remotely regarding protection and life insurance and longerterm contracts wasnt necessarily their priority and they find that probably a little more difficult to do i think you can see that across the industry so we do believe it will come back but to our point we have a whole range of products on the shelf that has nothing to do with our individual products for them to sell but imagine theyre not really locking in some longerterm fixed type of contracts like iul and insurance right now with the lower rates but our structured annuities are really doing well and we just launched that so that will ramp up and i do believe this will come back in time but you got to look at the dislocation and working remotely and where advisors have to keep their focus suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay got it and then the second question is just as we think about like theres a lot of moving pieces in advice wealth management but when we think about that sort of earnings base of i think it was million pretax or ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 the margin how should we think about those two things trending over the balance of the year i know you dont give guidance but just any color to try to get a sense of all these moving pieces would be really helpful james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say this i think overall listen we really have been impacted as others have with the shortterm interest reduction almost the full effect is in our numbers right now but if you look at where our margins were when the fed rates were this low back two or three years ago youll find that our margins have continued to improve disregarding the spread revenue i think as i look at it we have billed we do bill our wrap accounts at the beginning of the month so we didnt get the full benefit of the market recovering there our wrap flows continue to be quite strong over billion we brought in just as much a new client business during that time we have good productivity improvements in our advisor base theyre uptaking our technology really well even through this pandemic we have really great engagement remotely and i do believe that were making good progress in getting more advisorbased relationships that will both cause more growth and deepening the clients we are serving now as i mentioned in my talking points the satisfaction is really high so that will mean good flows for the future and good referrals and i think well continue to work on getting that productivity as we continue to work through the pandemic so i feel good and the last point very clearly is we invested in the bank for a good reason we believe that over time we will get good spread out of the bank as we invest and as we grow the banking institution we dont really have any bad credit on the bank right now and so its a positive for us as we start to invest and grow and i think all those things will come to fruition but i feel like were still very much on track to where we were and how but youre going to have some impacts based on the market volatility and the interest rate environment but i dont feel any different i actually would say i feel really great about the type of results we got in the second quarter during this pandemic suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc all right thanks jim operator our next question comes from humphrey lee from dowling partners humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners good morning and thank you for taking my questions just to followup on awm so you talked about the advisors focus during the second quarter was kind of engaging customers who focus on longterm objectives and selling some of the insurance products were not their priority but do you see any change kind of throughout the quarter and maybe into july any change in terms of transactional activities and maybe how should we think about that in the third quarter walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the transaction activity is improving gradually but it is really we have to were watching that because it evolves but its beginning to show some signs but again its were monitoring it right now ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners okay shifting gear in asset management very good net flows for the quarter i think in retail its probably the first time weve seen positive net new sales for quite sometime can you talk about like what you saw in the quarter and how should we think about the momentum that youre seeing in asset management in general james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say as i looked at the number of managers reporting so far were one of i dont know three so far that i saw in positive inflows during the quarter a significant improvement for us and a continuation of the improvement weve seen over the last few quarters were getting good results i mean weve been in nice inflows in our equity business which is different than what youll see in the industry and we feel very good about our activity levels particularly in the us across our distribution channels so that continues to do well for us and the blip up that we saw in the redemptions in march and beginning of april have come back down to more normalized levels so sales have really increased tremendously yearoveryear in europe its still a bit weaker its improved nicely from where it was a year ago but its still a bit weaker based on the european riskoff markets but thats starting to recover and we see some of that improving continuing improving as we go through so overall were feeling good about the asset management business people have been able to really engage remotely and were continuing to have a good lineup of funds the investment performance is really good so far and were hoping that we can even gain a bit more traction into the fixed income that would be complementary for us humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners and in your prepared remarks you talked about you were able to win some higher fee mandates in asia can you talk about like what is the potential in that particular market james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so where weve been focused really is one of our big outflows in the quarter was a very low fee insurance mandate that we expected based upon some changes in the business that we were supporting from the outside client but we are bringing in a bit better in the mandates both in some fixed income as well as equity product and some of those are from our institutional international clients both in apa sic apac as well as in emea and so we feel that we can continue to improve that pipeline and get some good mandates that have some good fees humphrey hung fai lee q analyst dowling partners got it thank you operator our next question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 hey good morning i wanted to go back to advice wealth and talk a little bit about the sweep accounts which were very high still at about billion and then the bank deposits declined i think from billion down to billion so the question is why did the bank kind of go backward a little bit in terms of deposits and how can you or can you move a good chunk of those sweep assets over to the bank over time walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so andrew let me answer that obviously there are two programs that work within the bank one is from the sweep account itself which has more of a permanent nature which were starting to now build the other is a program that we transfer in money to the bank for managed account activities which obviously has pretty high velocity in and out and thats what you saw at the end of the first quarter a lot of managed activity came in in cash and we obviously some of that got redeployed in the quarter so that was the drop but now youll be seeing us starting to build more of the sweep balances coming over to the bank as part of moving away from a third party onto promontory and that will be a building event so it was just the aberration of that shortterm cash that went in and out at the end of the first quarter and started getting redeployed in the second quarter andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc i see and walter could you and that makes a lot of sense could you possibly put numbers around your expectations for bank deposit growth walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we again if you look at peers and look at us we see a very large opportunity of the mix that we have of funds deployed to promontory third party banks versus being redeployed at the bank as jim said its a big opportunity for us to take advantage since the sweep accounts are at a certainly low earning point to start swinging in so you will see from our standpoint we havent were working through our plans now but in ranges of billion to billion coming out over between now and the end of next year that seems like its reasonable as we work through our plans thats the sort of numbers that we can see and we certainly have the capacity to do andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and then walter with regard to share repurchases this quarter was great you started in may you did million i think youre targeting somewhere in the to of earnings range do you see a path to getting back to kind of that more normal level of maybe more than million a quarter in share repurchases walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc again andrew we have the capacity theres no question about it as we evaluate it we are certainly one of the few that are actually redeploying capital back to shareholders to repurchase so were going to continue to monitor it but certainly its going to be one of the areas that well certainly continue to return im not exactly sure at this stage where the levels will be but certainly with the strength and capacity we have that will be an opportunity for us as we look forward i dont again im not going to quote ph will we go to million whatever but we are certainly one of the few that are actually buying back ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and just lastly are there any mas out there that you could deploy capital towards right now that seem more imminent walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc jim james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well andrew we have flexibility and i think as opportunities arise we continue to sort of look at things appropriately we feel however we have a good organic hand that we continue to play but if there are complementary things in lets say advice wealth or in some of the sectors of the asset management world we have the ability and weve been very successful in the past so those are the things that depending on the environment may come out andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks a lot operator our next question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you given were all sheltered in place and i know how much travel factors in for the asset management industry broadly both on the buy and sellside can you talk about savings youve seen from lack of travel and how much you see that remaining on a maybe semipermanent to permanent basis thank you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so we certainly as we looked at our te and our meetings as the world has changed from that standpoint we that is part of the savings i spoke about that we will have as the difference versus last year te perhaps and meetings is a reasonable pool i would say of the savings maybe in the area of about and then the redeployment is going to be based upon how we reassess our ability to do business in this environment and so were not really exactly sure were working through plans about how we do facetoface or we do virtual as we change the way our business model works in this environment so thats an open switch right now but certainly we are getting good savings coming from them and thats going to certainly increase as we go through but this first quarter was basically a freeze and then well start evaluating that hybrid model of how we operate going forward ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i would say that we will going forward have a hybrid model we see good opportunity to engage virtually that will be complemented by facetoface we dont think that facetoface will go away we think that may be important in certain new types of business activities and engagement and as well as for more deeper engagement but we do believe that we can complement it with the virtual capabilities that we have and that weve been learning from and we think that will be embedded in the way we do business moving forward john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co great thank you for your answer operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for taking the questions good morning a couple of followups on the bank i guess the one more explicit i guess nearterm question walter can you tell us what the nii at the bank was in the second quarter and then slightly i guess bigger picture strategyrelated heard your comments about moving billion to billion i guess thats through the end of next year from third party bank sweep to the ameriprise bank that doesnt seem particularly aggressive i guess given that its you guys are sitting on billionplus of third party cash sweeps so why not move a little bit faster it feels like you could pick up anywhere from to basis points on that cash right now is that something clientrelated meaning you guys need clients to actually optin to go to the ameriprise bank or what are sort of the constraints youre dealing with there thats preventing you from going a little faster walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think theres two things that let me deal with that part of your question one is we have arrangements with promontory banks and we said we honor those arrangements it is not a customerrestricted element from that standpoint at all and also its a matter of ensuring we have this is where it becomes trying to gauge the investment opportunity that we want to make that has the right return but also has the right risk elements to it so i wont give you a range we certainly have flexibility within that and it depends on again deploying that cash effectively that meets our return and risk characteristics is probably a gating factor as were evaluating this environment that is one of the factors that will go into the evaluation alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc all right and nii at the bank in the second quarter walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc im trying to the net interest margin from interest income in the bank trying to see from i dont actually have that in front of me i will have to get that to you okay im sorry about that all right ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay yeah no worries and then just a followup question again sticking with awm for a second again near term and the longerterm piece there but i guess in the nearterm any way you can just give us ga guidance for third quarter and fourth quarter and give us a sense of how much of that is still related to the bank buildout and when you expect that to fade out and then a bigger picture question for both you and jim i guess when you think about the experience in that segment over the last several months and the ability to still recruit pretty aggressively despite people working from home what are sort of the key lessons learned that we might take away from that that could improve upon the profitability of recruiting going forward walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc all right so as far as the expenses as i said the expenses we are anticipating certainly that it will build as you take a look at what we saw what the expense differential was in the first half as we go to second youll see a build there as it relates to savings as we get towards that target of being million under for the company and the bank does play a big role in the expense base that we have in awm its in the million range and we build through it so its a factor but again were making investments for our growth and the bank is an important part of that and now on the recruiting side i think we have seen a good recovery the teams have gotten in and really developed a capability of virtually meeting with prospective experienced advisors and now theyre evaluating again certainly seeing a lot of advisors now the question is the close rate and how to handle it and i think we are feeling confident that we are getting a good trend line as we adjust to this hybrid model and i think that weve been quite effective not only in arranging meetings with them and then coming to closure but also on onboarding its been extremely effective so were feeling quite good about our situation right now alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks very much walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning yet another question on awm to start with if i just look at nii in the segment it dropped from around million last quarter to million this quarter sequentially why did it drop so much are those floating rate assets and would you expect that nii to stabilize walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we have a combination of whats been taking place in our net interest income and distribution as you look at the bank and other things we have certainly in the bank have had the majority of the assets that we ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 had in the bank were floating rate and then we started augmenting them in the third quarter excuse me at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter with fixed maturity so youve been getting a combination but clearly the investments that weve had in the bank were totally floating rate agency highquality paper that obviously has gone down and then we started now investing out on fixed maturity so thats the combination that youre seeing plus from that standpoint that is an impact and weve adjusted our transfer pricing okay as it relates to the market but thats between the institutions but thats whats taking place is primarily floating assets dropping off us now starting to add fixed maturity assets which are higher yield being very prudent about what investments we look at and that is the main driver thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and walter where would you expect incremental pressure or do you feel like that should be more stable going forward walter stanley berman q executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think were at a pretty good point of stable from the floating rate side listen i cant im not predicting but certainly as it relates to it and as we now start investing out on the fixed maturity curve youre going to start seeing that increment up especially as we reposition the portfolio and we add new liabilities in to invest out on thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got you so that could actually go up a little bit then walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes yes again it depends on were being very measured and trying to be certainly theres opportunities out there but we want to make sure as were doing investments that its meeting our yield curve objectives yield objectives but also meeting our risk objectives so were the team is doing a great job but again its you have to be careful with the paper out there thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got it and i guess just a followup so broadly then the cash sweep it looks like the margin compression there should be behind you and then when you think about spread income whether thats bank nim or otherwise would you say if you look out assuming rates remain where they are over the next few quarters would you expect any incremental rate pressure adding all these things up or would you expect that to be behind you walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would say that as we start implementing the strategy for fixed maturity investments we are going to start seeing that spread income giving us a lift and i do believe that the floating side again i cant tell you where rates are going to go but certainly i believe that thats probably more behind us than versus headwinds but who knows ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 where the environment is but certainly with us taking out positive actions to start investing out on fixed maturities will start to yield and improve our yield thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got you and then thats helpful and then just my final question is just on long term care one question is thats clearly trending favorably right now would you just given i guess the big both well call it mortalityrelated plus lower submitted claims incidents would you expect that to remain at a similar profitability level or at least at a higher than normal profitability level the next couple of quarters on lt care walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so listen we have seen unfortunate improvement because obviously it has impacts to our clients certainly from our standpoint we dont know if thats a longterm trend but on the shortterm end with whats going on in the various states certainly it looks like it continues to be problematic i dont know if its going to spill over to the nursing homes the actuaries are looking at it and but we are seeing the benefit so far i cant really tell you if its going to continue certainly its not going to get worse for us from that standpoint but i cant really tell you whether that trend is going to continue but its one that we benefited in in this quarter for sure thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator our last question will be from ryan krueger from kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks good morning walter first i just wanted to clarify your comment that expenses were expected to be down million yearoveryear on a consolidated basis was that total expenses or specific to ga expenses walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc that was ga i was talking about ga ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks and then on fixed annuity reinsurance i mean i guess should we i guess would you still consider doing a transaction in the current interest rate environment if you can get acceptable pricing or should we think about that as more off the table in the nearterm contingent on rates rising walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc our objective has not changed its certainly something that we intend to do we are getting inbounds and were evaluating them but there is a challenge with the interest rate environment but certainly we are getting inbounds coming in and were evaluating it so its something that is not if were going to do it its when were going to do it and what is going to be appropriate balance on a shareholder basis but its still our objective set ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2
