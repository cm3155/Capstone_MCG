customer deposits declining only million or importantly we saw momentum in the second half of the year with customer deposits increasing million combined in the third and fourth quarters for annualized growth turning to key credit metrics our disciplined approach continues to enable strong credit performance delinquency ratio increased decreased im sorry to basis points of total loans and our lowest ratio of net chargeoffs declined to or basis point of total average loans nonperforming assets increased to basis points primarily driven by the downgrade of a wellcollateralized longterm

financial usa inc thank you bruce i first want to say how thrilled i am to be part of the htlf team ive long admired htlf from positions in peer banks and im very excited to be part of a talented team thats just in the beginning of the htlf strategic transformation the unusual items in the quarter that bruce described are detailed in our earnings release and on page of our earnings presentation most of these items are related to actions that will improve the profitability of the bank going forward we had a pretax loss of million related to a sale of securities the proceeds from this repositioning were used to pay down highcost wholesale deposits and borrowings this both improves our liquidity profile and will result in approximately million in improved net interest income per quarter going forward we had million of restructuring expenses million related to sales and valuations of facilities and million of expenses as we consolidated our final bank charter in the quarter we executed on projects to centralize our retail management and to consolidate our footprint these are just the beginning of the plans under htlf to increase our operational leverage optimize our efficiency and to serve our customers more effectively refer to our earnings deck for more details on our strategic transformation finally we had an fdic insurance special assessment as many banks did this quarter of million we continue to see good economic trends in our business loan growth totaled million and customer deposits grew million with average customer deposits increasing million compared to the prior quarter loans to deposits increased to as we decreased our wholesale deposits investments decreased million due to bond sales of million and normal amortization offset by improvements in fair value with the decline in interest rates we are very pleased that our revenue growth exceeded analyst and even our own expectations in the quarter net revenues increased or million when adjusting for the securities loss this is driven mostly by our expanding net interest margin which increased to heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 loan yields increased basis points to while interestbearing liabilities only increased basis points to the total cost of deposits decreased basis point to noninterest expense was up in the quarter and adjusting for the million of unusual items expenses were up million professional fees were higher than usual and we expect them to normalize going forward also we made additional investments in tax credit projects which are offset with benefits in tax expense these two items account for million of additional expenses in the quarter and excluding them expenses wouldve been down around million the adjusted efficiency ratio was for both the quarter and full year noninterest income when adjusting for securities losses was flat to the prior quarter this included a decrease of in consumer nsf and overdraft fees in the month of december as we instituted new fee policies across our single charter customer base this is a permanent change to our consumer fee structure that will impact our fee income going forward but we expect to offset this with growth in treasury management card fees and other strategic fee initiatives the provision for loan losses was million in the quarter with an allowance for lendingrelated credit losses of of total loans the provision was driven by loan growth and one credit that moved to nonaccrual status that required a specific reserve net loan chargeoffs remain low at basis point for the quarter and basis points for the full year and delinquencies were also low at basis points to total loans capital ratios are strong with the cet1 ratio of even after the securities loss and other restructuring expenses that will improve our profitability going forward the tangible common equity ratio increased basis points to which benefited from the increase in market value of our investments and the reduction in assets as part of our balance sheet repositioning if you refer to page of our earnings deck we provide our management outlook for compared to our results assuming no change in the economic environment we expect loan growth of to principally in our commercial portfolio in the year we anticipate a to increase in deposits to fund loan growth with strong commercial and some consumer growth we plan to let our securities portfolio amortize down with the cash flows used to pay off wholesale funding we expect a stable net interest margin of around assuming a stable interest rate environment we expect our full year provision for credit losses to increase modestly we expect core noninterest income to be flat with growth in treasury management and card fees offset by lower consumer and small business nsf and overdraft fees as well as lower mortgage fees with our exit of the mortgage business in core expenses should be down around with lower occupancy marketing legal and operational expenses offset by performance compensation and technology investments our effective tax rate should be around excluding discrete items such as new tax credits and finally earnings accretion and securities amortization are expected to increase all capital ratios with cet1 approaching to by yearend i will now turn the time back over to bruce bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks kevin was a year of significant progress and successful execution of our strategic plans we completed charter consolidation on time under budget and exceeded estimated net savings we then initiated heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 htlf weve repositioned

digital platform to serve consumers and small business customers we remain focused on continuing to achieve organic growth while reducing expenses enhancing eps growth delivering a higher return on assets and efficiently using our capital so i think now we can turn it over to qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi good afternoon just a couple questions i guess on the outlook the first on the margin stable here i guess in line with kind of q4 i wanted to kind of check in on sensitivity with rate cuts in the second half if there were to be some generally speaking well first question is surprised maybe no tail of benefit from the restructuring maybe thats chewed up by deposit costs in the first part of the year but then if you could just kind of position us for where the balance sheet is should you see some rate cuts in the second half kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc ill respond that it really depends on how the yield curve plays out this year were inverted now we do hope that the yield curve normalizes over time and that really will impact banks across the country ill say that we are assetsensitive so on a raw basis unadjusted any basis points decreased rates impacts us about to basis points in our nim thats on a raw basis we do have the opportunity to react and strategically create some opportunities to buoy that up among many other things that were talking about right now we can put some hedging floors in place with our loans we have some opportunities to reposition some of our wholesale funding we have a lot of deposit programs going on that should benefit us and that we have some hedges in place that make us more assetsensitive but those roll off over time and so this is the topic of the year obviously and we are all over it and have some strategic initiatives right now to be able to be prepared for a rate down scenario bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 jeff this is bruce i might add a couple of things its really very dependent upon what the deposit betas are and if were able to overachieve what weve modeled that helps the margin also if as we expect were able to grow deposits to fund loan and use the cash flow of the investment portfolio to repay wholesale funding i mean that in essence shrinks our balance sheet but that is an accretive trade to our margin and to our revenue jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc so it really depends on our ability to execute on those couple of things on whether or not well be able to improve on the decrease in margin that kevin discussed with a each quarter percent move jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thank you for that and a quick one on the expense guide what would you put the base of the core expense in to kind of base off of the down kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think the easiest way to look at it is the fourth quarter so expenses came in at about million you take out million of those unusual items and then i also called out another million of run rate that was higher than normal so that puts you about million million quarterly that seems like our run rate going forward and that includes merit increases performance increases so underlying there are a lot of benefits were seeing from the initiatives weve been doing over the past few years jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co kevin if i take that million million again and then youre going to hope to improve expenses by over the course of the year off that quarterly run rate kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i should be a little more clear that would be our run rate million to million quarter on average jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay for the balance of the year kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thats right heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay okay one last one if i could wanted to kind of bruce youve laid out a pretty good plan here with first question would be kind of the timeline to that i havent had a chance to look through all the slides of the i guess in the tangible what do you think youll complete this year and then second part of that question is i guess if ma were to present itself in terms of bankers or markets that youve targeted that you want to grow into not abandon the plan but you pivot and say well we can acquire this for a cheaper i guess clarifying that question what part does ma come up if it did and it were attractive and it accelerated kind of what youre doing with in terms some of the growth in talent acquisition bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah thank you thanks jeff so let me maybe first talk about what well achieve in and beyond if you look on page of the earnings deck it kind of lays out what our targets are for three years and we would expect to make progress in every single area during but it really starts to rampup in and because a lot of the investments particularly in people and in our treasury management investments are really being made in so i think thats probably at the moment the best i can do but we would expect again to make progress but the significant progress happens in and and we feel very confident to be able to achieve these targets over that period of time and if we look at ma so first were very far along in the talent acquisition in those specific markets and we would look at ma if it was the right culture provided the right accretion they were focused as a commercial bank and they were in market particularly in those growth markets that i mentioned so were not opposed at all to ma and have ongoing dialogue with some institutions in those markets but our focus right now is on talent acquisition as opposed to ma but we would pivot if we needed to or if the opportunity presented itself jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co sounds good thank you operator thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks jeff operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens inc your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc kevin welcome to the call and bryan best of luck to you in the future maybe if i could start when i was looking through slides through i just kept seeing dollar signs just a significant investment in a lot of important areas so i guess my question is how are you paying for htlf is it all footprint and facilities optimization and i guess how do you alleviate any concerns that therell be some expense creep as we move through and into bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so maybe lets talk first about facilities for a moment i think its pretty obvious as we look at all of our facilities and how weve grown over the years that our facilities are to years old theyre too large they were built at a time where branches were utilized by consumers and its a whole different world so this were now going to attack our cost structure we believe that not only the real estate but also the people will all come down so im not really worried about account or expense creep because while were doing it were also investing in additional technology particularly the digital bank for the consumers and small business so were really we feel very confident that our delivery system will actually decrease pretty significantly over this threeyear period of time did i answer that your question there terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yes yes and just as a followup when you were in your prepared remarks when you say kind of take a look at your footprint do you mean individual locations within a region or a state or are you implying looking at a state or something larger than just one branch if my question makes sense bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah terry in my comments i was really talking about much more than a branch or potentially even a region we are really taking a deep dive into each of our markets and looking at the capital that we have invested the returns that were getting and where we look out a couple years to see whether or not the growth will be there in those markets so were taking a very heavy look at that which honestly weve never really done in the past kevin l thompson q chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc okay and then maybe just a quick question for nathan the increase in nonaccrual or nonperforming loans it was companyspecific not connected to any broader weakness in your manufacturing customer base is that a fair statement nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 its a very fair statement and again its wellcollateralized so its something were actively working and ph were hopeful as we look forward on it but well continue to work through it kevin l thompson q chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks for taking my questions operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch of piper sandler your line is open bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi good afternoon thanks for taking the question hi the provision though looks like with a company that voluntarily is shutting down is that tied to this manufacturing credit just kind of curious on the specifics around that bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc im going to let nathan take that one andrew nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc ill take that one andrew no thats a different company its one of the ones that we just decided to take a very conservative posture as you start to get into accounts receivable and a lot of the other areas were working through that one we decided to go ahead and just take a sort of posture so we dont have to keep coming back we can just deal with it upfront and then move through it andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it all right and then the expense guidance here does not include any tax credit amortization and i guess youve had those now for several quarters so its kind of we have to kind of forecast those out some way or another so i guess whats your expectation on that going forward kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah youre right the tax credits weve been doing recently are solar tax credits that are more short term in nature and they do impact expenses but they also benefit the tax line and so we dont currently anticipate any for this year but we will be opportunistic if anything interesting comes up andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 got it okay so it should be a pretty clean year for the tax rate and for the expense base right kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thats what we expect at this point andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it all right youve covered all my other questions ill step back thank you kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks andrew operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of damon delmonte of kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon everybody hope everybodys doing well kevin welcome and bryan best of luck in your new endeavors just wanted to followup on the outlook for provision i think you noted that itd be up slightly over the year does that include the elevated amount here in the fourth quarter or are you talking about if it was a normalized level kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc that mostly includes loan growth and it does carry forward our current credit outlook in the credits that nathan mentioned earlier which we think are wellcontrolled but we are being conservative in case the economy softens a little bit and were providing a little bit for loan growth there damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and the one credit that drove the provision higher was that loan included in the npl increase this quarter as well nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 yes it was it was just a smaller piece of it and honestly if those two loans werent there it would have been a recovery so the other one the major driver was the other one that was a manufacturing company that was primarily driving the increase damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then lastly just on fee income you kind of expect it to remain flattish but a little bit of pressure i think you said on the service fee line kind of offset by growth in some other areas did i hear that correctly kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thats correct yeah a little bit of pressure we already saw in the fourth quarter and you saw we were flat still the third quarter so weve already started to overcome that in treasury management and some of the other htlf initiatives that were working on damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats all that i had thank you kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc i want to followup on the footprint review question maybe terry was kind of going this route but as youre completing this footprint review would one of your subsidiary banks could that potentially be a sale candidate is that something that we can go that far to mention or could you talk about that as an option bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say that everythings on the table when we look at one of our subsidiaries and again were very focused on the capital that we have allocated the growth of our subsidiaries as well as the expense structure of those same subsidiaries heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and ill just add as part of htlf part of that is bringing on talent and we brought on a really talented team to help us understand the underlying economics of our business and really help us understand capital allocations and funds transfer pricing what is truly contributing to the profitability of this company going forward so that we can really dynamically and strategically look at that and adapt to this interesting banking environment i believe well see in the next several years bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i would also say david now that we have all of our charters consolidated and were looking at everybody through the same lens it does have a different approach to things where before when we had separate charters separate balance sheets they may have a different investment portfolio with a different yield which generates a different answer but now as weve consolidated everything and were looking at everybody on a consistent basis it comes up with different answers david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it no thats great color thanks guys and then the other question i had i think kevin you mentioned a million in incremental nii from the sort of portfolio restructuring with the securities sale when you say million incremental is that on top of what you reported here in the fourth quarter what is that million incremental based on kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc we benefited from some of that in the fourth quarter the securities repositioning happened on november so we saw about half of that benefit million of that in the quarter and so there are obviously a lot of puts and takes in your net interest margin going forward thats a benefit theres still headwinds in the economy with banks still experiencing higher deposit costs thank goodness we did not we were flat this quarter which is a really good sign going forward but a lot of good puts and takes going forward we could do better than that on net interest margin if the again the yield curve cooperates but were not sure how the federal reserve is going to react were not sure what competition is going to look like this is kind of unchartered territory that were making sure that were prepared for david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc excellent thats great thanks for the clarity and then just finally the htlf are you expecting any noncore expenses on top of that million to million run rate or do you think most of those have already been included kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc most of those are already included there could be some as were going through were just in the initial stages of htlf and were evolving as we go so there could be areas where there are additional expenses but there would be from our view a very quick earn back of those expenses to buoy up our model heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2024 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc awesome great thanks for answering my questions kevin l thompson a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc you bet that includes real estate ill add if theres something in our footprint that needs adjustments operator thank you as there are no further questions id like to turn the call back over to mr lee for any closing comments bruce k
