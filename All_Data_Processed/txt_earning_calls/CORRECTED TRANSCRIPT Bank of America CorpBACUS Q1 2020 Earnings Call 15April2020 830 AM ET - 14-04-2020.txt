think about our quarter our decadeplus long discipline of responsible growth has resulted in us strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade has helped us prepare for this environment today were going to do three things with you first im going to provide a couple highlevel thoughts on the quarter second im going to make sure you know how were supporting our teammates our customers our communities and delivering for you our shareholders during this crisis and third paul will cover the results in more detail ill start this discussion by covering the chart on slide along with the comments on slide which go with the chart given the volatility in the last couple months and the global slowdown im proud of bank of america and our teams results i want to thank my teammates across our company for all of their efforts this quarter both in the frontline roles and support functions its been a companywide effort to continue to serve our customers well during these times as i said many times were in a war against the covid19 and at bank of america were doing our part to help fight the effects of that war we do that by living our purpose were helping people manage their financial lives through this crisis my teammates know theyre playing a critical role for their clients whether the people whether companies of all different sizes and institutional investors their role is to help keep the economy moving as best we can during this healthcare crisis we have seen major disruption in the financial markets that effected every lineofbusiness as customers move to stay at home status through voluntary or involuntary measures in the united states and around the world governments are responding with historic measures in a very short period of time central banks governments and others have responded to provide tremendous liquidity to keep the markets functioning and to protect individuals and businesses at a historic scale the banking industry continues to play a vital role were wellcapitalized with strong liquidity and we have helped transmit the benefits of these programs as well as our own measures in the economy and markets so lets cover our first quarter performance in the first quarter bank of america produced billion of after tax earnings this included building our loan loss reserve by billion over chargeoffs and thats due to the economic deterioration of the global economy as a result of the virus earnings per share were earnings were down billion from last year this was led by the reserve build i think its useful to draw your attention to the pretax preprovision income line as we believe it helps illustrate the underlying earnings power of the company to support the credit costs that are inevitable in a downturn we produced billion of pretax preprovision income in the first quarter of that was down from the first quarter of that is relatively strong given the changes in interest rates that have occurred the widening of credit spreads and other changes across the past months particularly in the last quarter or so bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 during this period we maintained our strong balance sheets global markets clients needs for liquidity temporarily increased our balance sheet during the quarter by as much as billion from year end but through the efforts of tom montag and team we ended the quarter marginally up small business originations not from any of the special programs were billion during this quarter showing support for that segment of the economy we also met our larger commercial borrowing customers demands with commercial loans increasing billion as clients drew down against their unfunded commitments and new commitments were made in addition to these fundings which reduced commitments we also had requests for new commitments remember some of the commitments that were making are for clients like grocers health care companies and others who need liquidity because of the rising demand for their services during this time at the same time we returned billion in capital to our shareholders and as you know during the quarter we voluntarily chose to suspend the buyback portion of those distributions to shore capital for expected customer growth we did all that in our common equity tier ratio of still finished basis points above our minimum from our liquidity standpoint we ended the period with billion in liquidity increasing billion from year end driving that increase was deposits increasing billion far exceeding our billion expansion in our loan portfolio moving away from the balance sheet and on to earnings a couple highlights id point out nii finished a bit better than expected at billion on an fte basis flat with fourth quarter capital markets revenue was strong sales and trading revenues excluding dva were up yearoveryear and investment banking fees were up yearoveryear we had a record quarter in fab gallos equities trading business our noninterest expense was a touch better than expected as well at billion net chargeoffs remained low a little more than billion up million from last quarter driven by an uptick in commercial obviously returns to the quarter were lower given the reserve build return on tangible common equity was lets turn to slide just as important as our financial results this quarter is what were doing to take care of our teammates and to help clients and communities impacted by the virus we do this not only because its right thing to do but also in the end it will benefit you the shareholder many of our teammates are on the front lines of this effort including daily engagement with the clients whether its in our financial centers which remain open financial advisors guiding their clients through the turbulent times or the capital and liquidity were providing to companies across the businesses to be able to do all these great things to support clients our first priority since the crisis was to address the health and safety of our teammates weve taken that teammatecentric view of our efforts because its the right thing to do and we need these teammates to do a great job for the clients weve taken extensive measures in our business continuity work to prevent teammate exposure to the virus weve established multiple locations for important work of our trading operations and call center platforms and otherwise enabled social distancing by moving more than people to work from home that means ensuring that they have appropriate tools and resources and we have the appropriate control protocols for them to do their daytoday work bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 to give you a sense of scale we have deployed about laptops in the last days across the company weve moved quickly to assure social distancing in our facilities that are still open installed additional protective barriers in all our branches thinned outstanding operations environments and posted health care professionals in our facilities to help anybody were also taking measure to help our employees better handle the stresses in their personal lives you can see some highlight here one example has been our increased child care support we allow teammates to hire relatives and others so they can work given school and daycare outages our life events services team provides teammates with personalized support resources tools and access to benefits and were providing special compensation to teammates in the financial centers operations centers and call centers we also hired teammates in march to continue to increase the staffing we need especially in the consumerrelated areas to handle our clients needs and we announced that there would be no layoffs during of our teammates our previous announced an hour minimum compensation is now in effect and reflected in the numbers youre seeing across the company and we confirmed our commitment to bring on our young kids for summer jobs and starting their first job whether graduating from college or graduate school taking care of the employees is the right thing to do and enables each to play the important role they must provide as critical providers of services to help the economy keep rolling through the virus were doing that in many ways in addition to keeping our financial center open and the many things i mentioned earlier were doing more for our clients through these times customers who are struggling to make their payments are calling the bank with deferral requests on loans and waiver of fees as in other disruptive events that weve done for hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and other things over time we work with them since this humanitarian crisis began we received more than million requests for assistance through early april weve seen the volume of the deferrals however reduce since the peak a week or two ago and well see where it goes next weve provided a chart on the material beginning on slide about the deferrals as you can see in our case the largest number of requests has come from cardholders but as a percentage of loans we have the most requests from our small business clients these clients are at the heart of the governmental programs and are also at the heart of businesses that were shut down due to the stayathome orders by governments one of the things thats different about this business for us is it lends to doctors dentists and others they have deferred payments until they can reopen their practices were a leading lender to them and youll see those recover as they go back to business our mortgage requests remain relatively low in volume and some of our customers for all our customers weve also suspended foreclosures or repossessions of autos which may have been pending our affluent clients are also looking for our company in these turbulent times weve been there for clients with both upgraded systems and capabilities to allow them to trade a centralized investment office supplementing advisors capabilities to talk to the clients and give advice and counsel client engagement during the quarter was up twothirds from last year even as if our advisors work from home for small business clients we built the first digital platform for the ppp program and we launched it days ago the team is working hard to drive over requests for funding through the process so that we can get those loans funded as stated earlier our regular way of small business support was over billion in the quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 for larger clients we provided billion in access or unfunded commitments imagine the speed and capacity that our team did to absorb the requests so quickly and get them funded over the course of the quarter these commitments are a muchneeded liquidity bridge for many clients especially in light of the rapid changes that occurred in march in the commercial paper markets and in debt markets as those markets opened up we also saw strong debt capital markets issuances to support clients in fact march ended up being the busiest month ever for us highgrade market with approximately billion of total issuances the previous record was billion and we led the market april has continued this busy pace and has been good to see that access is expanding to high yield clients for our institutional trading clients we have provided an operationally sound system with improving speeds of trading in a single day we had trillion in payment value made again the investments made over the past years to our trading platforms delivered more speed and capacity to make that possible and all doing while maintaining good controls the clients we serve in that business had witnessed severe volatility in markets and were able to provide them with liquidity when they need it since the month end spike you can see the tom since the midmonth spike tom and the team managed the balance sheet into the place we need to be at the end of the quarter lastly to assure communities around the us where we live and work got some assistance before the government money came to help we announced million donation to help fight the virus outcomes and supplied vital support across those communities our market presence and other leaders are playing a vital role in this critical action weve also increased our capital to community development financial institutions by million on top of our industryleading billion commitment to these institutions as weve discussed each quarter and frequently over the last decade weve transformed our company so we could serve clients consistently across all areas weve added a slide in the appendix to remind you how much the company has improved this balance sheet position and risk profile since the last crisis ph weve done some stress testing to illustrate our preparedness but were now being tested in the new environment we didnt know what economic challenges might cause us to have to demonstrate this resilience and that challenge is upon us now i remain very proud of what my teammates have accomplished across every dimension to help us be ready and empower the part theyre playing to help the world win this war against this virus an area that we focused on also is consumer spending weve seen a shift in consumer payments and this is on slide beginning on slide overall a couple months ago in a healthy us economy payments were running at a highsingle digit in fact in some cases a low doubledigit percentage increase over the same period prior of january and february versus january and february and in fact that would have shown that the economy this quarter probably was going to grow faster than people expected that changed with the virus spread and you can see that impact here on slide we saw a severe immediate decline in discretionary payments for travel leisure and other things that youve read about and entertainment that you expected this was followed immediately by large increases in payments for necessities around groceries and staples like health supplies et cetera then as large cities and states began to move to voluntary and mandated stayathome status orders we saw large declines in debit and credit card spending into other categories at the same time weve also noted a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 stabilizing going on in the level of payments in other areas like ach cash wires and p2p payments the broader measure is the black line in the chart as you can see overall payments have declined but remained at high single digit pace yearoveryear moving down from doubledigit pace to around the total movement in the us has been pulled down by a significant decline in the card spending which is more than ph up which has been affected by the travel entertainment and other related areas and retail areas and thats gone from to to only increases in the month of march and it has fallen to negative territory in april the overall spending however of all types of spending in our customers seems to have stabilized in the last few weeks during midapril were seeing spending run at about a low billion average level compared to billion average level before the crisis thats perweek spending well see how that plays out through this quarter and that stability may provide insight to the level of economy activity in the shutdown status our digital banking capabilities have helped with both customers service and sales while our financial center visits are down and sales are down because of that were seeing consumer digital logins remain steady as people manage their financial lives on a digital basis digital sales are down but theyre now running about of the total sales our loan production for cars mortgage and other products has fallen weekbyweek for the first two weeks of april comparing that to the february average levels were seeing them down for card origination for mortgage and for autos again were watching to see these stabilize at some level of activity even given the shutdown economy and well keep watching that as states cities and the federal government focuses on reopening the economy on slide you can see the couple charts showing the commercial loan draw velocity and deposits in march in total we saw billion increase in commercial loans due to draws from the commercial clients in the month of march of these fundings came from large commercial clients were from large corporate bank customers and the remainder was spread across all the businesses as to the asset quality of what we funded of these were collateralized or were made to investmentgrade clients and less than million were made to clients whose loans became nonperforming the draws were welldiversified by industry and were largely driven by us borrowers from a capital standpoint were already riskweighting these commitments at under standardized capital so the additional impact to cet1 from these draws was roughly basis points for the quarter the draw activity was pretty normal through the first week of march but ramped up in the second week before peaking in the third week of the month the requests have come down in every one of the last three weeks and as weve seen we turned april draw requests and new credit requests have mitigated at these levels were seeing clients attentions turn from securing liquidity to more structured view of their capital position and their needs to better understand how they will prosper and fare in the covid19 impacted business model we observed earlier that the commercial paper market froze in the middle of the quarter as new rounds of virus worsened clients were unable to access the cp markets as the fed announced the programs we saw that market stabilize and over time here weve seen it lengthen out so draws can be for long periods of time its worth noting since we have one of the premier global treasury services platforms in the world we saw many of those draws come back in our balance sheets as deposits ph while the of the loan draws were not used for other paydowns ended up as deposits with our company in addition to that at the bottom of the slide you can see the growth in deposits by every line of business global banking deposits rose billion bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 which is unusual for sure we also saw billion increase in consumer deposits with of that being checking that has been our normal in fact its the 28th quarter of the last that weve had yearoveryear growth at billion or more in consumer banking deposits wealth management deposits reflect a flight to cash in the first quarter but have been stabilizing last year as you can see in the charts paul will show you later so with that let me turn it over to paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian good morning everyone im beginning on slide with the balance sheet overall compared to the end of q4 the balance sheet expanded billion driven by an increase in deposits of billion deposit growth in excess of our loan growth was invested primarily in cash or cash equivalents as brian mentioned the team did an incredible job of not only providing our global markets clients the needed liquidity from a midmarch spike but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter shareholders equity of billion was stable with yearend but included some offsetting factors aoci increased billion reflecting several factors but was driven by a billion improvement in the valuation of afs debt securities offsetting this increase to equity were two items share repurchases and common dividends of billion exceeded our billion of earnings given the reserve build this quarter and as a reminder we booked a reduction in equity on january by adopting cecl now with respect to cecl we elected the fiveyear transition option made available under the fed rule to delay any capital effects of cecl until the january reserve build plus q1s billion build equate to a total increase in the reserve of billion since yearend assuming no regulatory relief including the original relief planned for day one adoption our cet1 ratio would be basis points lower than we reported the relief received in late march accounted for of the basis points as you know a portion of the cet1 impact of future reserve increases or decreases during the emergency period will also be delayed until beginning in q1 of we will begin phasing in the basis point reduction for these impacts in equal quarterly amounts through with respect to our cet1 our cet1 standardized ratio declined basis points to driven by a billion increase in rwa increases in counterparty risk in global markets and increased loan revolvers draws in global banking drove the rwa increase lastly our tlac ratios remain comfortably above our requirement given the time constraints in brians points earlier on ending deposits i will skip the discussion on average deposits on slide and move to slide earlier brian also discussed our loan growth near the end of the quarter which was driven by revolver draws some of that growth affected the growth of average loans presented on slide q2 should further reflect this late quarter growth yearoveryear average growth has been consistently in the midsingledigit range and early q1 trends were similar to that note the significant increases across consumer and gwim which was driven by residential mortgage given continued low interest rates this quarter we originated billion in first mortgage loans retaining on our books we continue to see good followthrough on a large pipeline but ph apps are down in the past couple of weeks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 i would also note credit card balances average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical seasonality given the dropoff in consumer spending late in the quarter while customer payment rates continued at a fairly steady pace given the significant drop in card spending we expect card balances to decline further in q2 okay turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in q1 was billion billion on an fte basis and was relatively flat compared to q4 one less day of interest and lower asset yields driven by lower rates negatively impacted nii this quarter two primary things offset these negative impacts first we saw good loan and deposit growth second lower rates reduced the costs of our longterm debt and improved our funding costs in global markets the lower rates also allowed us to price our deposits more efficiently in wealth management and global banking before i discuss our forward view of nii i want to emphasize that future nii results will be influenced by interest rates as well as loan and deposit balances which will likely be highly influenced by the virus impact upon the economy both of these drivers have been volatile and may continue to be in terms of the forward guidance as you know interest rates dropped significantly over the past days on the short end onemonth libor which impacts variable rate loan pricing as well as longerterm rates which impact mortgage and mortgage related assets have both dropped nearly basis points on a spot basis as you think about our nii for the rest of the year i would point you to the asset sensitivity disclosure for our banking book at before we experienced these rate declines banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of basis points in rate at that time was estimated to reduce nii by billion over the following months since these rates moved less than basis points the change in nii over the next months is likely to be less than billion i would also note some additional items to consider that are expected to mitigate some of that decline first we have grown both loans and deposits significantly more than what would have been assumed in that asset sensitivity at year end second our deposit pricing actions have been pretty swift and last the asset sensitivity of the banking book does not include the benefits to nii of the trading book which is a little liability sensitive with that said we would expect the largest decline in nii over the balance of to impact q2 as the bulk of the repricing of our variable rate loans should happen fairly quickly considering all these factors particularly the virus impact on the economy and interest rates we believe nii could approach billion in q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative impacts of longerterm asset repricing turning to slide and expenses at billion this quarter expenses were up they were higher than q1 as increased investments throughout in people real estate and technology initiatives were partially offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives compared to q4 expense increased roughly million reflecting nearly million in seasonally elevated payroll tax expense with respect to our outlook we are still assessing the impacts both positive and negative that the virus has had on the companys expenses and as such are not in a position to provide any updates to our previous expectation that expense would be in the mid53 billion range this year as a reminder that mid53 billion number was before considering the dissolution of our bams jv and surrounding actions bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 with respect to impacts of the pandemic on the one hand there are many costs that declined such as travel meeting costs lodging conferences and lower power costs for unused facilities incentives will align with financial performance and market levels but on the other hand as you heard brian mention earlier there are costs associated with protecting supporting and rewarding our employees during this health crisis including suspending head count reductions related to covid for the rest of we also have costs from the setup operation and cleaning of backup facilities for trading and other activities this would include the cost of computers and other supplies and expenses to reposition associates to work from home okay turning to asset quality on slide our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for years now and we expect this strength to differentiate us as we advance through this health crisis for years now we have been focused on client selection and getting paid appropriately for the risk we take as you all know what really impacts banks in a recession is not the loans put on your books during stress but rather the quality of your portfolio booked during the years leading up to stress one independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the federal reserves annual ccar stress test our net chargeoff ratio under those stress tests has been lower than peers in six of the last seven years and our consistent focus on asset quality has been reflected in our results for many years now adjusted for the recoveries of loan sales in some periods as described before we have reported net chargeoffs between million and billion for many quarters total net chargeoffs this quarter were billion or basis points of average loans net chargeoffs rose million from q4 driven by commercial losses with the largest contribution coming from energy exposure we saw a small seasonal increase in card losses provision expense was billion our reserve build of billion reflects the expected increase in lifeofloan losses given the weaker current and expected economic conditions as a result of the virus on slide we break out the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios q1 is too early to see any significant effects of covid on net chargeoffs however there were a couple of leading indicators of deteriorating asset quality in our commercial portfolio due to the virus as both npls and reservable criticized exposures increased on the consumer front covids effect on asset quality were less observable this is likely due to deferral offers extended to consumer borrowers moving forward we believe deferrals coupled with government stimulus for individuals and small businesses should aid in minimizing future losses having said that given the rise in unemployment claims we do expect consumer losses to increase later this year and potentially into turning to slide this table provides a full picture of our allowance increase since including the implementation of cecl as well as this quarters build given the worsening economic conditions as you can see our allowance including reserves for unfunded commitments was billion at year end and now stands at billion that is nearly a billion increase or since year end note that we ended q1 with an allowance to loan and leases of i would also note the increase in the coverage ratio for credit card increased to and the coverage ratios for our us commercial and commercial real estate increased to and respectively these ratios reflect our underwriting standards over the past years as well as our loan mix with the large concentration of secured consumer loans bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 we size the increase to our allowance in the quarter by weighting a number of different scenarios all of which assumed a recession of various depth and longevity including an assumption of some tail risk similar to what is in the severely adverse scenarios a weighting of these scenarios produced a recessionary outlook which includes a marked drop in gdp in q2 growth recovered slowly from there with negative growth rates in gdp extending well into obviously there are many unknowns including how governments fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome and how our own deferral programs will impact losses but perhaps the biggest unknown is how long how long economic activity and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide consumer banking earned billion results were impacted by covid19 through lower rates higher provision expense and modest fee reductions as you know banking is considered an essential service and across the country we have kept more than of our financial centers open in addition weve added personnel to service calls and manage digital interactions not only with respect to existing products and services but also on small business applications through the paycheck protection program many of these additional personnel are working from home while net income declined from q1 its worth noting that pretax preprovision income declined revenue decline driven by lower interest rates as well as the impact of covid19 aside from the higher provision costs consumer fees also reflected modestly lower consumer spending and fee waivers beginning late in the quarter we continued to invest in the franchise driving expenses up yearoveryear we added new and renovated financial centers salespeople and increased minimum wages plus the additional associates added to service calls i just mentioned the expense for these investments continued to be mitigated by process improvements digitalization and technology improvements investments supported continued growth in loans as well as deposits as a result our cost of deposits declined to basis points client momentum continued as we saw average deposits increase billion from q1 average loans increased and we continued to add consumer investment accounts and saw solid flows into our merrill edge platform lets skip slide as i think i covered much of the trends on slide already the ability of our customers to connect through digital banking has never been more important as you can see on slide all aspects of digital engagements continued to increase with onethird of sales now processed through digital channels and as you heard that moved higher in the last few weeks of the quarter we learned a lot from our digital auto and mortgage experiences and what we learned enabled us to quickly launch a digital pathway for our small businesses to apply for loans in the paycheck protection program turning to global wealth investment management on slide here again we saw lower rates and covid19 related credit costs impact and otherwise solid quarter note the impact of lower market levels in march those impacts did not impact q1 aum fees as march fees were calculated based upon market levels at the end of february merrill lynch and the private bank both continued to grow clients as well as remain a provider of choice for affluent clients net income of million was down from q1 but here again pretax preprovision income was down a more modest revenue grew yearoveryear as a strong increase in aum fees and brokerage fees were partially offset by a decline in nii as a result of lower interest rates expenses increased from revenuerelated incentives as well as investments we made in the past months in sales professionals technology and our brand bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 okay lets skip slide and move to global banking on slide the early impacts of covid19 were more evident in this segment first libor fell rapidly in march impacting loan yields at the same time revolver draws didnt happen until late in the quarter and will likely be more fully reflected in q2 averages of loans and nii lastly covidrelated credit costs are higher in this segment as the reserve build was more heavily weighted to commercial loans the business earned million which included adding billion to the allowance for credit losses on a pretax preprovision income basis results declined driven by lower interest rates and by roughly million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value in our capital markets books and fpo book on the positive side in q1 we were able to improve our investment banking revenue and market share we generated billion in investment banking fees this quarter a increase yearoveryear in fact despite a yearoveryear decline in the volume of investment banking transactions across all banks we processed more transactions in q1 than the previous year growth in investment banking fees loans and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flighttoquality in uncertain times but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing and improving client coverage turning to slide brian covered the most important points around loan and deposit growth i just want to reiterate one point we believe companies viewed us as a safe haven in this period of stress quarterover quarter on an ending basis deposits increased billion while loans increased billion not only were we able to capture as deposits the bulk of the cash that customers drew on the revolvers that wasnt used to pay down debt or for other purposes we were also able to attract billions more in additional deposits even as pricing deposits lower with falling rates turning to slide as in consumer and gwim our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever enabling clients to work from home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs and its no surprise that in this environment we continue to see increased use of these capabilities switching to global markets on slide as i usually do i will talk about results excluding dva despite the volatility experienced in the quarter global markets produced billion of earnings in q1 a increase year overyear yearoveryear revenue was up from both higher sales and trading results and improved investment banking fees expense was up a more modest yearoveryear on higher revenuerelated costs within revenue sales and trading improved yearoveryear driven by a improvement in equities and a increase in ficc in a significantly more volatile market environment when compared to q1 last year ficc revenue reflected better trading performance across macro products offsetting weaker performance in credit sensitive products resulting from widening credit spreads which impacted asset prices equity revenue of billion was a record for the company all right skipping slide and moving to all other on slide all other reported a loss of million the loss reflects approximately million for several valuation reductions including marks on derivative positions and certain noncore securities which were impacted by wider spreads toward the end of the quarter our effective tax rate this quarter was it included the impact of a fairly normal level of tax credits from our commitment to sustainable energy products and other esg efforts many of which are taxed advantaged applying this fairly normal level of tax credits against a lower pretax earnings base resulted in a lower tax rate its just math for the full year i would expect the etr to be in a range of to okay with that i think well open it up to questions bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question today from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead your line open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thank you very much for all the detailed insight in particular your slide that talked about the percentage of folks who have been asking for deferrals is extremely interesting as well as the detail on the reserving analysis my question has to do with how you thought about that reserving analysis i know weve been through stress tests here for years now and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size this very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp paul why dont you hit that please paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure so i mean let me answer the last part first weve put a reserve on our balance sheet that we think reflects the information that we had at the end of q1 and so in terms of whats going to happen in the future that reserve is going to go up or down based upon the facts and circumstances and our view of the future when we get to the end of q2 i think when you think about reserves youve got to really focus on loan mix and the quality of the portfolio and then you have the added variable under cecl of everybody coming up with a view of the future we sized our reserve build in q1 by weighting a number of economic scenarios all of which assumed a recession of various depth and longevity and that included assuming some tail risk similar to whats in the severely adverse scenarios so when we weighted the scenarios that produced clearly a recessionary outlook which included a significant drop in gdp in the second quarter with negative gdp growth rates extending well into we also considered the impact of various groups of credits and stressed industries and while small relative to the impact of scenario weighting we incrementally factored that analysis into the sizing of our reserve build obviously there are many unknowns including how government fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome but we can try to consider that as well and we also had to consider how our own deferral programs will impact losses but perhaps the biggest unknown is how long economic activities and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so betsy i might add a couple things if you sort of benchmark this has nothing to do with setting under gaap its just sort of okay now you have it lets look at it i think were about of the last years fed supervisory severely adverse total losses type of numbers thats one way to think about it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 and then another thing to think about is the construct of the portfolios those of you like yourself have been around our company a lot i went back and started saying sort of are we sure how much different we are and you people forget things that it wont mean a lot to people on the phone the gold option program which was a restructuring of card debt that went on in the mid it started to go into the crisis in timeframes at billion eight quarters later six quarters later something like thats down to billion half of that was chargeoff theres none of that around now and so its not only the fico scores and all of the things that you have its also that theres pieces of the portfolio costs us a lot in the last crisis arent there and thats just how we positioned the portfolio so even some of the industries which people we are focused on as a credit grantor and youre focused on as an analyst are relatively in this industry or that industry so the list of sort of concerning industries entertainment travel things like that we have low exposures to because of diversity and mix of portfolio you touched on the deferrals let me just give you a couple perspectives on that one on that small business as i mentioned earlier the reason why its high is theres a lot of doctors and dentists in there and you would expect that they would pay but to give you a sense before their deferral of these people were current under all the measures and so theyre not people who were struggling they were people who were current that just needed a hiatus to their change the fico scores for 90pluspercent of the mortgage deferrals 95plus on the cards again about i guess are or better so the average fico is almost of a deferral so youd expect that people who have deferred are doing it as a matter of convenience and will get back in the flow once indiscernible reopens and so and the ltvs on the mortgage is again or under only or are really the fha va of the deferred program and theyre or better all the rest of it is low of it is below ltv and stuff so these are core people who had a change wed expect to start to perform so well see how it plays out but its very different i think than past deferral statuses we had betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc its a very impressive reserve ratio and in addition your cet1 stayed relatively high this quarter as well i just wanted to ask a followup brian around how youre thinking about the dividend its been a question that many investors have been asking and maybe if you can give us a sense as to how you think through that question brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp let me just lee just corrected me its of the adverse not severely adverse i think is what lee is telling me were in two different locations so usually he can wave at me when ive made a mistake but in terms of the dividend weve kept the dividend payout ratio below of the sort of normalized earnings level and we did it for a reason that we one of our operating principles we want to maintain a dividend and given what we know weve earned twice the dividend this quarter at versus an payout ratio and we expect that to continue and that shows you the 100plus basis points basis points of excess capital weve tested it lots of ways as you might expect as we talk to our board about capital management as we talk to our board about dividends on any given time were showing them severely adverse cases adverse cases and thinking through the pretax ppnr capability of withstanding different reserve builds and outcomes and so thats what were doing and plan to keep it going bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator well go now to john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah hi just a quick followup on that paul i know you mentioned in terms of the macro assumptions its a weighted average but what you described is kind of a deep dive in gdp and then continuing negative for the rest of the year is that kind of the central case and is there any more details you could provide on that as just we compare different banks and what macro assumptions are embedded into the reserve its helpful to know the kind of maybe central case of assumptions thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean just to be clear what i said was its a significant drop in gdp in the second quarter and then negative gdp growth to extend well into i think approaching all the way to the end of the year so we view it as a recessionary outlook we wouldnt describe it any other way none of the scenarios that were looking at are anything other than a recession and again weve captured sort of the tail risk of a severely adverse situation in terms of providing yeah go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research no no go ahead please paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i was going to say in terms of providing specifics on one variable or another youve got a lot of variables that go into these models many many many variables and so we really believe that to provide that level of detail could be a little misleading unless you have the full context of all the factors that we considered when we set the allowance picking one or the other and starting to compare here or there just to us i think would be misleading plus very importantly the impact of all those multiple inputs that go into the process will be different from each bank depending upon the banks loan mix and very importantly the quality of the loan portfolio that theyve been putting on the books for years i think brian just sort of talked about it but ill say it again weve been very focused on prime and super prime customer borrowers for many years now so the impacts to us of all those inputs is going to be different and i guess thats what all the information i would want to give you about like one input or another hopefully that helps you in terms of how we think about it john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah and the reference point to ccar is helpful too it sounds like what you provided for built into the reserve is about of the cumulative losses from the feds adverse in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah again as brian said thats more of an output not an input right we are developing scenarios based upon the information we had at the end of the quarter but it is interesting and its maybe helpful for all of you in terms of comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix the quality of the portfolio and then of course what people assumed about the future but in terms of the loan mix and the quality of the portfolio there is an independent view out there theres an independent view every year and so if you look at our losses in the severely adverse the feds stress test our losses under the severely adverse or our losses under the adverse and then you look at our reserve and you divide by those losses youre going to get percentages that are in the range or better than what youre seeing across the industry john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and remember those tests basically are an independent way to evaluate the quality of somebodys portfolio and the mix of somebodys portfolio so we think again we didnt size it that way but we think thats an interesting way for you to kind of get some sort of independent perspective on allowances john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah i think its helpful for us to compare across banks that way thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp you still have the issue though by the way that every bank is going to have a you know this is the first quarter were all doing cecl and everybody is going to have to develop their own view of the future and theres no evidence right now that you can point to of asset degradation theres a little bit of npls theres a little bit of reserved criticized so were all doing this based upon just our view of the future based upon all those inputs that we use in our models john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it operator well go now to mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey paul same question maybe more specifically how much more could paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 same answer mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc same answer well just how much i mean how much more could the reserves get built in the second quarter and when you defined a significant drop in gdp how do you define significant i mean look i mean the stock premarket looks like its going to open down or if my numbers are right and you just guided for better nii and you earned your dividend at least two times up to four times depending on how you compute it your book value grew you have good capital ratios you have the balance sheet strength to take the additional charges so why not just take it for like the worst case that youre allowed to do so and communicate that and say all right your capital is still fine so you had one of your peers kind of telegraph that you seem to be hesitant to do so given all of the different variables i understand but can you give us any a little bit more guidance for reserve builds say in the second quarter or the third quarter paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure and again like you said we have the liquidity we have the capital our reserve build if you look at independent perspectives from the fed or other sources our reserve build as a percentage of future losses under multiple scenarios that they publish is higher or in the range of our competitors so thats a lot of information for you right there in terms of your question about hey whats the likely reserve build in the future if we thought we were going to have to add more reserve build in the future we would have put it into this quarter thats how the rules work you reserve for your expected lifetime losses so our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of the quarter were going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books now when we get to the end of the second quarter we may have a different view of the future and so we may release reserves or we may increase reserves the quality of our loan book wont change that much because that doesnt change that much in the quarter the mix doesnt change that much because that doesnt change in the quarter weve built this loan book based upon years years of underwriting standards and so itll go down the reserve will go down in the second quarter or go up in the second quarter but itll be based upon a change in our outlook on the future mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it if i can follow with brian then i mean clearly the biggest input is when does the economy come back online and brian you and your firm have as many touchpoints nationally as anybody there must be some underlying thought process that goes into the reserve build and the losses about when the economy comes back online kind of whats your base case best case bad scenario what are you seeing what are your thoughts brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well one thing that is different mike and you well know is the plenary authority embedded in governors the mayors and the president to tell us what to do is overriding here so we could have a view of what can happen but given the health care crisis as is as opposed to demand changes and things that would be out of the general economic flow or credit risk because commercial real estate got overvalued the things that weve dealt with in our bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 lifetimes as youve dealt with this is just different so we have to remind ourselves always this is going to come down to solving this health care crisis and is number one just to give you some facts of where we stand and well see this play out as i said earlier if you look at sort of the weekly flow of payments across all of means meaning cash taken out of the atms and spent through checks written through ach wires and credit and debit card that was around billion odd a week in januaryfebruary and now its running like billion billion average for the last couple of weeks but youre seeing that rate of decline flatten at this point and if you go and look at geographies based on the data we see weve seen it sort of flatten so youre seeing what might be a relatively and thats after the unemployment claims have been filed and were seeing the unemployment come into the accounts youre seeing a rate of the rate of decline sort of flatten and as you look at it sort of compared to the rate of decline yearoveryear by week and things like that and different types of industries theyve got into the bottom in some travel or entertainment youve gotten to a more sustainable maybe in drug stores and grocery stores and you sort of see the economy running at that level and so that would imply whatever the over decline that will hold on well watch but right now that seems to be holding on the places have been shut down longer and well see that play out as it goes forward to see if that starts to grow from there remember gas prices are down a lot and gas usage is down a lot that impacts those numbers also so were looking for those signs im not saying we have anything yet were looking for those signs were also looking for how the unemployment affects our customer base and so weve seen as households that we have as unemployment one of the participants in the household we have a lot of dualearning households of the households that we have whove received unemployment also have someone receiving a regular paycheck still and so those types of things will be interesting to see it play out is that a change in behavior in terms of what people spend on versus a real crisis in the household because of one wage earner well figure that out so were seeing balances in households especially among the moderately affluent not grow in terms of checking account balances because people are spending less and storing cash weve seen it in the wealth management side people can delay paying their taxes so all these factors will play in its just a little premature to call anything mike and so thats the factors were looking at as we look at not only to your point about how you said potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what happens to them but also based on our view of the economy opening up and frankly our advice to people who want as to what parts of the economy could have a faster impact with less they are the health care experts with less risk of people congregating versus others that might help support a reopening or get activity go back to the dentist or something like that you could put dentists back to work that will open up part of the economy that is usually not closed down for these things and its a relatively few number of people in a given space or given time so ill leave it to health care experts to make those judgments but all thats going to come together as we move through the quarter well try to give you better insight but right now thats what were seeing mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right so thats why you say reserves could go up or they could be released you just dont know yet brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 i mean its just people are we all want to see where the end is you included mike we do too but the question is weve got to wait for some time to pass to have a feel for that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much maybe one more quickie on allowance and reserves when i look at the healthy reserve on card it makes sense given the macro backdrop were looking at and unemployment and kind of the linear relationship with unemployment and card if you look at say us commercial and nonus commercial in and around thats obviously a lot more than weve had lately but not necessarily the worst thing you could predict given the world were looking at so i guess my question is when you talk about the quality and the mix of business and all the things that you gave us is the what i consider the not as severe reserve on the commercial side a function of not knowing the timing the mix of business or is it where you sit in the capital stack meaning even if some of those companies run into issues your historical experience in the last bunch of years has been actually really really good so i know its probably all of those but im just trying to see if you could talk towards that on the commercial side paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp look weve got billion on commercial real estate given how we have run our commercial real estate business over the last years especially relative to others we feel thats up from billion at january weve got billion on us commercial those commercial losses they just dont run as high because of collateral and other protections we have in the structure so we feel pretty good if you look at total commercial were at billion so we feel good about where we are and again its when you sort of add all that up and you just look at it relative to the losses that people are projecting including the fed whether its an adverse scenario or its an adverse scenario youre going to come out with percentages that are pretty healthy on an absolute basis and relative to our peers brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and glenn id add one thing lets go back to the beginning on the pretax ppnr which we all learned after the last crisis that earnings power to absorb payasyougo losses on the consumer side in terms of card chargeoffs and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side which is what happens typically that earnings power is i think what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability to absorb whatever circumstances play out here and with more liquidity than the start of the year more capital than we need basis points more capital and the ppnr volume that lets us drive through it and if you think about that ppnr when you look at the stress test and stuff we are running a lot higher than the stress test assume because they assume theres market losses and things like that which we didnt experience even in the most volatile periods of time in the markets history bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 and so i think as you play this out whether we can all talk about the reserve of x or y or z per thing which is what you all are focused on and should be focused on the reality is how much earnings capacity you have to keep generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you and thats what we feel good about glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you both paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp if you study that portfolio remember its mostly investmentgrade and if you look at it the other way around if you looked at the amount of loans or revolvers that we have in leveraged finance private equity sponsored leveraged loans for example thats less than of total exposures we dont have any clo exposures because we dont put any of that in our ph all portfolio weve got a fraction a tiny bit in global markets for trading purposes so that commercial portfolio is relatively highgrade glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi great detail i appreciate it thank you operator well go now to vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc just brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hello paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp you still there vivek ph is it us operator vivek we are not able to hear you at this time please check the mute function on your phone brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp operator lets move on to the next one well pick him up later operator well go now to matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 good morning the net nii guidance obviously helpful and coming off a much better than expected i just wonder if you can give a little more detail in terms of i assume some of the sharp drop is higher bond premium amortization lower trading and then obviously kind of core nim pressures is how i think about the three buckets i dont know if thats right or you want to parse it differently but any additional color would be helpful thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean we did see bond premium amortization in q1 is always sort of seasonally low or lower we do expect an increase in q2 given the decline in rates in q1 youve got to remember that prepayment generally lag moves in nii well they precede moves in nii the rate move precede the nii impact by six to eight weeks what else did you ask about matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i assume trading benefit and is being factored in and then just kind of call it core nim pressure from the rate environment is the third bucket paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah yeah trading definitely we are liabilitysensitive in global markets but its not a huge impact and it can bounce around quartertoquarter depending upon the type of assets that theyre booking and whether they bought them at par or above or below par that influences whether profits show up or revenue shows up in nii or shows up in market making or similar activities so thats why we dont give guidance on it because it can change pretty rapidly depending on what theyre buying and selling for clients in global markets but right now it was a little bit liabilitysensitive and did help a little bit in q1 and itll probably help a little bit in q2 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then as we think about the balance sheet growth component obviously average balances will benefit from the runup on a period end in but i would think as you kind of look to the backhalf this year and beyond some of those line drawdowns in commercial start to get paid off so that maybe its tougher to grow the balance sheet or at least tougher to grow loans i dont know if thats the right way to think about it paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean theres no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in march will start to pay down once economic conditions start to improve but obviously the timing of that is very uncertain so i think were just going to have to wait and see clearly were going to see some carry over from these draws in q2 and we may see a very significant amount stay with us for some time well just have to waitandsee obviously deposit balances also benefit nii because you dont necessarily have to make a loan you can earn on those deposit balances and theyre way up as well and they may be with us for a little while well just have to wait and see matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 okay and then just last quickie paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp just so you know our nii guidance im not going to get into the details but our nii guidance of course assumes some sort of runoff were making some sort of guesses at this point about what the runoff would be in both loan and deposits matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah understood and then just lastly a quick one on the spread of the commercial lines drawdowns any rough numbers on that im often asked that question paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure the spread on the drawdowns were no different than what they were precrisis because theyre just drawdowns they are existing arrangements we worked with some clients to adjust the liquidity we were giving them there were a few new loans in there that were at higher spreads but most of the spreads were the same as were spreads precrisis so youre not going to get a spread benefit on those draws matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc maybe like a libor plus or paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp well given the quality of our loan book i wouldnt go as high as libor plus matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thats helpful thanks so much brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp in terms of who drew paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah in terms of who drew yeah brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp but one thing just to back up there will be a transitory impact we should all hope of these draws and stuff and that means more stability in the market more reopening of the economy so but what isnt transitory is the good core work that went on in our consumer business our wealth management businesses and the treasury services the core growth levels that will continue through even if the deposits that people have built in part go bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 back into other forms or get used up and so i think thats going to be the trick for a little while well all going to be preoccupied with the pace of those loans dropping off et cetera but the route is over the longterm were going to be based more on the way that underlying has performed going into this and frankly the amount of activity that can continue in the underlying business given this covid virus situation and our officers are making contact our wealth managers were continuing to add accounts in various businesses not at the rate that you would before but because just necessarily is not facetoface meetings taking place but youre seeing the wealth management contacts are up youre seeing even the referrals which means our lines of businesses continue its just at a lower rate because of the necessities of the facetoface meeting limitations but those will come back as soon as we can get back in action operator well go now to brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah good morning quick question i know you commented on the consumer deferrals that you were seeing but whats kind of been the trends on the corporate side as well and kind of whats been the inbound with regards to using some of these government programs from your clients out there brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp in terms of the government programs brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc correct brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah days ago we started taking applications in the ppp program weve had hundreds of thousand applications were processing them in accordance with the guidance that was given by treasury to get the work done and then submit them thousands have been through the sba ph and have a number and we have thousands many thousands ph in the hands of clients that are signing promissory notes and were funding them so that is still i think for the whole industry the real impact economic the money traveling out is coming will come over the next period of time here today we received the first major distribution of the direct payments in terms of the stimulus payment types were seeing now the unemployment benefits the extra 600type thing coming through and the benefit structures were seeing and the programs were seeing both as we service the state as a provider of prepaid card type card access to those programs and we see in our accounts so those programs are just barely hitting the general consumer general business et cetera for us and for the industry our industry peers are all in the same condition and so they will provide the stimulus they will provide is actually going to be from now on not from now backwards because this is a program that didnt exist literally three weeks ago only started days ago and several hundred thousand people have applied for it and were processing through it as fast as we can and its around on the more commercial banking side of the play bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and just a separate question i know youve built a big qualitative reserve now with cecl but kind of what are your expectations with regards to how the chargeoffs will roll through given all of the deferrals that are going on forbearance which could push potential chargeoffs out to a year or more are you really looking that you may not see much of an uptick this year and this really could be before you start to see meaningful degradation in the chargeoffs thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so the total amounts as you saw on page of the balance of deferrals so if you go to the inverse of that and we see of the cards are not deferred and they will pay us and stuff so i think the question is what really happens to your point so we deferred somebody who is a fico who temporarily lost their job or thought they are going to lose their job indiscernible and just wanted a month thatll come back and so i think the losses will shake out into the fall because just the methodology is you remember its to the days you have to roll through all the buckets and stuff so well see it play out but its going to be delayed but remember because the cecl youre providing for your expected outcome under that delay and paul gave you the parameters of what we talked about already so the question is thats what were putting up at the end of the first quarter when we get to second quarter well put it up and then third quarter all based on what we think the credit costs will be of that portfolio over the cycle ahead of us down into the trough and then back out the other side in a very slow matter as paul described and then the real question will be sort of peoples behavior given these government programs and the amount of extra cash going in and then on the employment the ppp program is employ people and pay people you get eight weeks of pay to pay them out and so well see how that all metes out to the underlying people but so i think its premature but i think it will delay chargeoffs but our reserve at any given moment reflect what we think will ultimately happen to those customers not when itll happen brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator and well go now to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks a lot hey paul just a couple of followups on the nii front for you with libor expanding versus fed funds and the ted spread still wide which typically happens obviously in times of stress how are you expecting that to traject as you talk about your billion number and just your expectation for rates in the long end of the curve paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so were basically factoring in a timing between libor and fed funds over the year but were also factoring in some loan and deposit growth offsetting that and then of course weve got securities and other bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 assets maturing that were going to replace at a lower yield and all thats factored into our perspective that we think with loan and deposit growth we can youll see nii kind of at that billion level give or take roughly through the end of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc so with all the cash thats sitting on the balance sheet and like you said earlier youre expecting some tapering of that what is the asset liability decision about what to invest and what youre putting it in and so like whats the kind of goto investment rate versus whats coming off paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp well right now that excess liquidity that all came flooding in is in cash and well have to think about what we want to do with that excess liquidity as it becomes clearer kind of how long its going to stick around right now if you just look at whats in our securities portfolio and compare to the yields available to reinvest they would be basis points lower but all thats kind of factored into our guidance ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right and one more question on the deposit side can you just talk about across the businesses what youre seeing from customers in terms of money coming out of the markets and whether its sitting in money market mutual funds in wealth management or whether its moved on to the balance sheet and just kind of how that ties into your ability to reprice deposits thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp just to start on that just generally customers put more cash and you saw that in the wealth management deposits being up billion so that reflects not only them moving money but also the reallocation in our models and things like that so youve seen that wed seen them stabilize my guess is twothirds of that was more what youre speaking about a third or so was sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter maybe a little less than that but a lot of it was moving itll move back in the markets based on the allocations and methods in terms of deposit forms of the markets and then on the money funds the allocations reflected there because of the prime money funds versus the government money funds theres a lot of instability around that towards the quarter so i think this will all settle out and youll see it return to more normal when people are thinking about that so youll see less volume growth in the balance sheet deposit ph driven than wealth management paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp im not sure what else i would add to that obviously we brought deposit pricing down in q1 you can see that in the average by product theyre going to come down further just based upon pricing actions that weve already taken that are just now going to start rolling into those average deposit pricing across the different types of products bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 in terms of growth we obviously saw very strong growth in q1 theres a lot of moving pieces there so its hard to give guidance on growth from here i just would emphasize what brian emphasized earlier that the underlying spike in deposits if you look beneath that underlying spike we still saw solid core organic growth across all our lobs in january and february in terms of the second quarter with respect to consumer youre going to have government stimulus and delayed tax payments thats going to be a tailwind gwim clients well just have to see they shifted out of investments into deposits were going to have to see how that plays out over time and then global banking we already discussed the large deposit inflows in march ending deposits grew billion quarteroverquarter as the markets stabilize and economic activity returns we do expect some component of those deposit balances to flow out over time as clients pay down their lines to pay other bills and redeploy liquidity so weve kind of factored all that in but at this point theres a lot of uncertainty ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood thanks a lot operator and well take our final question today from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry about that earlier but let me just jump in and not hold everybody up that much in your loan drawdowns you said investmentgrade what percentage of those were bbb minus and what are you thinking as you reserve how many of those are more vulnerable or more at risk of downgrades paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp well over were investmentgrade or secured i dont have how many were bbb minus in front of me vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and going back to i know just looking at the reserve build sorry to go back to that but it is the question of the day youve talked about gdp staying negative well into can you give some color on what youre thinking in terms of unemployment how high do you see your weightedaverage in paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp as i said before were not really providing that level of detail because we think comparisons on this input versus that input when theres or inputs in the models is going to be misleading unless you have a full context of all factors vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right okay another one and small business the deferrals that youve seen so far probably going to rise what are you thinking in terms of as youve done your reserving what percentage of those ultimately may not make it at this point indiscernible bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp if you were listening earlier vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ive been trying brian too many calls this morning all at the same time brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thats all right a substantial part of those small business are in a thing called practice solutions which are doctors and dentists and things like that and you expect once they open their practice they will pay because they dont want to lose their equipment practice so its a little different than the general small business that have and thats why that number is elevated just because of who the dominance of that portfolio as a percentage of the total so we expect a lot of it will come back and will see that play out as parts of the economy reopen thank you vivek brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and were going to move to close here because weve got an endpoint at and so let me just close quickly thank you all of you for your time this morning number one please keep your families and yourselves safe as we go through the rest of this health crisis simply put we earned billion we added substantially to our reserves based on our view at the end of the quarter our capital ratio is basis points over our minimums the liquidity is increased during the quarter but importantly we drove responsible growth supported our teammates our clients and our communities and delivered i think for the shareholders too given the circumstances that were going on as we look forward well continue to keep you apprised of what were seeing on our client base due to our purview and as we see that well continue to try to keep people informed to
