management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases fourth quarter and fullyear earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time id like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back its slightly longer this quarter to cover both our fourth quarter and fullyear results as well as spend some time talking about the outlook for next year starting with the fourth quarter on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of these results included a billion net credit reserve release which ill cover in more detail shortly adjusting for this we delivered a rotce this quarter touching on a few highlights as we suggested last quarter we have started to see a pickup in loan growth yearonyear and quarteronquarter exppp with a significant portion of this growth coming from awm and markets but were also seeing positive indicators in card as well as increasing revolver utilization in ci and it was an exceptionally strong quarter for investment banking particularly ma as well as another good quarter in awm on page we have some more detail on the fourth quarter revenue of billion was up yearonyear net interest income was up primarily driven by balance sheet growth partially offset by lower cib markets nii and nir was down largely driven by normalization in cib markets and lower production revenue in home lending mostly offset by higher ib fees on strong advisory youll notice that weve added some memo lines to this page this quarter to show nii and nir excluding markets as well as a third line of standalone markets total revenue which as we said before is more consistent with the way we run the company well be keeping this format going forward and youll see later that this is how we will talk about the outlook if you look at things on this basis the drivers are the same but the numbers are a little different nii excluding markets is up nir excluding markets is up and markets is down on normalization expenses of billion were up billion or largely on higher compensation and credit costs were a net benefit of billion reflecting reserve releases looking at the full year results on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and record revenue of billion we delivered a return on tangible common equity of or excluding the reserve releases and then on to reserves on page we released billion this quarter reflecting a more balanced outlook due to the continued resilience in the macroeconomic environment our outlook remains constructive but our reserve balances still account for various sources of uncertainty and potential downside as a result of the remaining abnormal features of the economic environment jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up slightly and reflecting nearly billion of capital distributions to shareholders including billion of net repurchases with that lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of billion including reserve releases of billion revenue of billion was down yearon year and reflects lower production margins in home lending and higher acquisition costs in card partially offset by higher asset management fees in consumer business banking many of the key balance sheet drivers are in line with the prior quarter deposits were up yearonyear and sequentially and client investment assets were up yearonyear about evenly split between market performance and flows combined credit and debit spend was up versus the fourth quarter of with each quarter in showing sequential growth compared to within that travel and entertainment spend was up versus though we have seen some softening in recent weeks contemporaneously with the omicron wave card outstandings were up yearonyear but remained down versus however its promising to see that while revolving balances bottomed in may of since then they have kept pace with growth rates in home lending loans were down yearonyear but up quarteronquarter as prepayments have slowed and it was another strong quarter for originations totaling billion up yearonyear in fact it was the highest fourth quarter since driven by increase in both purchase and refi volumes in auto average loans were up yearonyear and up quarteronquarter after several strong quarters the lack of vehicle supply resulted in a decline in originations to billion down yearonyear so overall loans exppp were up yearonyear and sequentially driven by card auto and expenses of billion were up yearonyear on higher compensation as well as continued investments in technology and marketing next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion for the fourth quarter and for the full year net income was billion on record revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up versus the prior year and up sequentially ib fees were up yearonyear primarily driven by a strong performance in advisory and we maintained our number one rank with a full year wallet share of in advisory we were up and it was the third consecutive alltime record quarter benefiting from elevated ma volumes that continued throughout specifically from midsized deals debt underwriting fees were up driven by an active leverage loan market primarily linked to acquisition financing and in equity underwriting fees were up primarily driven by our strong performance in ipos moving to markets total revenue was billion down against a record fourth quarter last year compared to we were up driven by a strong performance in equities fixed income was down yearonyear reflecting a more difficult trading environment early in the quarter especially in rates as well as continued normalization from the favorable trading performance last year in currencies emerging markets credit and commodities equity markets were down on billion of revenue as continued strength in prime was more than offset by modest weakness in derivatives for the full year equitys revenue was billion up and an alltime record it was a particularly strong year for both investment banking and markets and looking ahead we do expect some modest normalization of the wallet in however for purposes of the first quarter in investment banking the overall pipeline remains quite robust jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 payments revenue was billion up yearonyear or up excluding net gains on equity investments and the yearonyear growth was from higher fees and deposits largely offset by deposit margin compression security services revenue of billion was flat yearonyear expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly due to higher compensation as well as volume related and legal expenses and credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by the reserve release i mentioned upfront moving to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was up yearonyear on record investment banking revenue driven by continued strength in ma and acquisitionrelated financing expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely due to investments and higher volume and revenue related expenses deposits were up sequentially on seasonality loans were down yearonyear and up sequentially excluding ppp ci loans were up exppp primarily driven by higher revolver utilization and originations in middle markets and increased shortterm financing in corporate client banking cre loans were up with higher new loan originations offset by net payoff activity and credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by reserve releases with net chargeoffs of basis points and then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with a pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear as higher management fees and growth in deposits and loans were partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher performancerelated compensation and distribution fees for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion and for the full year were positive across all channels asset classes and regions totaling a record billion aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by strong net inflows and higher market levels and finally loans were up quarteronquarter with continued strength in custom lending mortgages and securitiesbased lending while deposits were up sequentially turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of billion revenue was a loss of million down million yearonyear nii was up million primarily on higher rates mostly offset by continued deposit growth and nir was down million primarily due to lower net gains on legacy equity investments expenses of million were down million yearonyear so with that as we close the books on we think its important to take a step back and look at the performance over the last few years through the volatility of the covid period and then pivot to discussing the and mediumterm outlook so turning to page what stands out is the stability of both revenues and returns through a very volatile period especially when you strip out the reserve build and subsequent releases in and if you look at the revenue drivers on the bottom lefthand side of the page you see overall revenue growth with some significant diversification benefits nii exmarkets was down nearly on the headwinds of lower rates jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 and card revolve that weve discussed throughout the year this was partially offset by significant nir growth ex markets largely from higher ib fees and awm management and performance fees and we also saw strength across products and regions and cib markets as the extraordinary market environment in did not normalize as much as we expected in so when you look across the company we saw consistent modest revenue growth as well as good performance in the areas that we control notably staying in front of our clients to serve them well and managing our risks effectively resulting in quite stable returns once again proving the power of the jpmorgan chase platform so turning to the next page the strong revenue performance and consistent returns have further bolstered our confidence in forging ahead with an investment strategy designed to ensure that were prepared for the long term on the lefthand side of the page you can see the expense drivers from to the first part is structural and while the growth of is modest over the twoyear period that includes some covidrelated effects that we would see as temporary including for example lower te spend and elevated employee attrition and we do expect some catchup in those effects as we look forward then the middle bar is billion of growth in volume and revenuerelated expenses some significant portion of that is driven by increases in incentive compensation primarily from investment banking markets and asset wealth management the major areas where we have seen exceptionally strong results and where changes in compensation are more closely linked to changes in performance and remember weve seen a lot of market appreciation and strong flows in awm and ccb so dont assume all of this is cib as you look forward because there are some versions of the world where the markets and fee wallet goes one way and awm goes the opposite way and then this bar also includes volumerelated noncomp expenses such as brokerage and distribution fees some of which are true expenses and some of which are bottom line neutral because theyre offset with revenue grossups then the last bar of billion as previewed with you this time last year is a result of our investment agenda which weve been executing largely according to our plans and consistent with our longstanding priorities you can see the breakdown of the total investment spend on the righthand side of the page billion growing to billion across the categories that weve often discussed were continuing to broaden our footprint and expand our distribution network then marketing where the significant increase in spend as part of the reopening in the second half of last year resulted in a fullyear spend comparable to and tech which weve broadened to include tech adjacent spend reflecting our recognition that tech means more than just software development and encompasses data and analytics ai as well as the physical aspects of modernization such as data centers and whats really powerful to note here is our ability to make these investments which are quite significant in dollar terms and are designed to secure our future while still delivering excellent current returns so over the next few pages lets double click into some of these investment areas to see what were doing starting with examples of marketing and distribution on page weve expanded our reach across the us and are thrilled to be the first bank in all contiguous states an important milestone in our branch market expansion plans we also continue to expand internationally including international markets as part of our commercial bank expansion china and both our cib and awm jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 businesses and in the uk with chase uk where weve seen exciting progress since we launched in september although we expect this to be a multiyear journey before having a measurable impact on the firm overall we continue to hire bankers and advisors in investment banking private banking and wealth management really across all of the wholesale and consumer footprint where we believe we have opportunities to better penetrate geographies and sectors to continue to grow share and as i just said the point of our investment strategy is to secure the future of the company so were not making shortterm claims about share outcome causality but as you can see at the bottom of the page our market shares are robust and growing broadly across the company turning to page in addition to all of our distributionrelated investments a critical foundational component of our strategy is technology where we spend over billion annually with about half of that being investments or as we sometimes call it change the bank spend its important to understand whats in the investment category about half of that is foundational and mandatory which includes regulatoryrelated investments modernization and the retirement of technical debt in addition to other key strategic initiatives to help us face the future on the lefthand side you can see some more detail around this modernization which includes migration to the cloud as well as upgrading legacy infrastructure and architecture data strategy that enables us to extract the value that exists in our proprietary dataset by cleaning it and staging it in the right ways and then deploying modern techniques against it attracting and acquiring top talent with modern skills and a product operating model which is obviously a popular buzzword these days but if you look through all that it reflects the simple reality that the best products get delivered when developers and business owners are working together iteratively with endtoend ownership underpinning all of this is our continued emphasis on cybersecurity to protect the firm and our clients and customers as well as maintaining a sound control environment moving to the righthand side the other half of the investment spend is to drive innovation across our businesses and with our clientfacing products we believe its critical to identify and resolve customer pain points and improve the user experience and were attacking the problem with a combination of building partnering and buying and so a few examples of that on the retail side weve been able to digitalize existing product offerings with applications like chase myhome and launched our cloudnative digital bank with our recent chase uk launch on the wholesale side weve continued to innovate on our execute trading platform commercialized blockchain through onyx and are building out realtime payments capabilities in addition our modernization allows us to more efficiently partner with or acquire more digitally centered companies and you can see several examples of this on the page so taken together our strategy and investments are critical to ensuring that we can compete with the most innovative players out there whether were the ones pushing the envelope of innovation or responding quickly to the creativity of our competitors but doing so at scale with that lets talk about the outlook and the year ahead starting on page as youll remember from daniels comments in december the that we have talked about as a mediumterm rotce target is not realistic for we do expect to see some tailwinds to nii including the benefit of the latest implieds and the expectation that card revolve rates will increase but the headwinds likely exceed the tailwinds as capital markets normalize off an elevated wallet and we continue to make additional investments as well as the impact of inflationary jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 pressures however despite these potential challenges for the nearterm outlook we do continue to believe in rotce as our central case for the medium term as rates continue to move higher and we realize business growth driven by our investments so let us try to give you more detail around forwardlooking drivers that could be headwinds or tailwinds so first the rate curve our central case does not require a return to a fed funds target rate as the current forward curve only prices in six basis points hikes over the next three years assuming we realize the forward curve from there we see the outcomes as being relatively symmetric with plus or minus basis points of rotce impact as a reasonable range relative to our central case and of course there are obviously any number of rate paths to get there which could produce different outcomes over the near term in this illustration the downside assumes that rates stay relatively constant to current spot rates whereas upside would be driven by a combination of a steeper yield curve and more hikes together with a more favorable deposit reprice experience and of course what we are evaluating here is the impact of rates in isolation on nii but for the performance of the company as a whole credit matters a lot and the reason why rates are higher will have an impact on that in markets and banking we feel good about the share weve taken and there are reasons why the beginning of a ratehiking cycle could be quite healthy for fixed income revenues in particular at least in the sense that it might provide a partial offset to what we would otherwise expect in terms of postcovid revenue normalization in our central case markets and banking normalize somewhat in relative to their respective record years in and and resume modest growth thereafter the downside case assumes a return to trendline levels with subgdp growth rates whereas the upside case assumes continued growth from current elevated levels as weve been discussing in consumer the big surprise as we emerge from the worst moments of the pandemic was the lower level of card revolve even as spend has started to return in our central case we assume healthy sales growth on the back of continued economic recovery and strong account acquisitions and that combined with relatively constant revolve rates generates a strong recovery in revolving balances but there are those who worry about a permanent structural shift in consumer behavior which could be a source of downside and in that scenario revolving balances could stay depressed relative to the longterm prepandemic averages resulting in approximately basis points of downside relative to our central case of course there could be an upside case where revolving balances recover much faster but we believe the risks here are more likely to be skewed to the downside and then lets touch on inflation for a second which is obviously increasingly relevant on balance modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us but under some scenarios elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit which could represent around basis points of downside and while its not on the page another key driver is capital where even though we remain hopeful our central case assumes no recalibration of the rules and that we will operate at a higher cet1 reflecting that we finish the year in the gsib bucket which equates to a increase from gsib in the central case although as a reminder that does not become binding until this is a good opportunity to point out that qe deposit growth and growth of the overall financial system proxied by gdp growth of the factors in the original rule release combined represent two full gsib buckets so in the absence of those we would still be in the bucket with that in mind any recalibration could be a tailwind and each change in the cet1 level is worth about basis points of rotce and to be clear for simplicity we have assumed a normal credit environment in the analysis on the page so when we take a step back jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 remains our central case in the medium term but over the next to years we expect to earn modestly below that target in light of all that lets talk about nearterm guidance on page we expect nii excluding markets to be roughly billion in up approximately billion from as i mentioned upfront this is a change relative to how weve previously guided as we feel that the ups and downs of markets nii can be a distraction when the vast majority of that variation is likely to be bottomline neutral looking at the key drivers of that for there are a few major factors rates with the market implieds suggesting approximately three hikes later this year and the recent steepening of the yield curve we would expect to see about billion more nii from that effect you can see at the bottom right weve shown you the third quarter earnings at risk and an estimate of what we would expect to disclose in the 10k reflecting the yearend rate curve and changes in the portfolio composition and as we note in our quarterly filings there are lots of reasons to be careful when trying to use ear to predict nii changes under real world conditions but at a high level if you look at the numbers on the bottom right and whats happening to the yield curve recently you should find the billion increase relatively intuitive then balance sheet growth and mix where we are expecting higher spend and new originations to drive revolving balances back to levels and also benefiting from securities deployment towards the end of and into and partially offsetting both of those factors is the rolloff of ppp so while we do expect nii to increase yearonyear depending on the path of rates it may take a couple of years to return to the full nii generating capacity of the company turning to page as we said at the outset of this section we are in for a couple of years of subtarget returns despite this we are going to continue to invest and were not going to let temporary headwinds distract us from critical strategic ambitions and so looking at adjusted expenses we expect roughly billion in an increase of about billion yearonyear or and before we go into the breakdown its worth noting while the yearonyear increase is eye catching a meaningful portion of it is actually the annualization of post reopening trends from the second half of across various categories so starting with the first bucket on the page which is the structural expense increase as i alluded to earlier we are seeing some catchup this year both from the impact of inflation in our compensation expenses as well as higher noncomp expense with the resumption of te then volume and revenuerelated expenses remember that this is both comp and noncomp from a comp perspective to the extent we are assuming some normalization of capital markets revenues there should be a tailwind here but keep in mind a couple of points the normalization assumption for markets and ib fees at this point is pretty modest and our assumption for aum is for modest increases at the same time we have the impact of volume growth on noncomp both in wholesale and in consumer which is offset by lower auto lease depreciation and most importantly we are adding another billion of investments which i would note includes the run rate impact of our acquisitions as well as some of the run rate effects that i just mentioned and reflects similar themes to the ones i discussed earlier as i wrap up its another good moment to stop and note how privileged we are to have the financial strength and the earningsgenerating capacity to absorb these inflationary pressures while also making critical investments to secure the future of the company so in closing on page were happy with what weve been able to achieve over the last two years not only the business results some of which are highlighted here on the page but also continuing to serve our customers clients and communities and importantly executing on our strategic priorities jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 as we look ahead we will continue to invest and innovate to build and strengthen this franchise for the longterm and while there may be headwinds in the near term as we continue to work through the consequences of the pandemic weve never felt better about the company and our position in this very competitive dynamic landscape so with that operator please open the line for qa question and answer section operator thank you everyone please stand by and our first question is coming from the line of erika najarian from ubs please proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs hi good morning jeremy my first question is for you and its on page and its a twopart question on this guidance the first is could you help us size the timing and magnitude of deposit data that you presume in the billion number as well as the size of securities deployment and the second part to that question is clearly were missing that white box right in terms of cib markets contribution and if you could give us sort of rails to think about cib markets in light of your comments about more modest normalization versus the idea that this business is naturally liability sensitive jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right okay so three questions in there let me take them one at a time so beta at the end of the day the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment but for the purposes of working through the guidance i can tell you that were assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle all else equal the environment is a little bit different in some important respects so i think the system this time around is flushed with deposits is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasnt before so that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower on the other hand the competitive environment is different especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction so it will be what it will be but for the purposes of the guidance were assuming a reprice experience thats similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle in terms of deployment obviously deployment is going to be a situational decision but if youre looking at the billion bar on page securities deployment is a modest contributor to that billion number the bulk of it is the loan growth narrative particularly in card and then in terms of markets nii the whole point of not guiding explicitly to markets nii is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there which can come from a lot of really kind of irrelevant places like interest rate hikes in brazil and cash versus futures positions which is the example i like to give but big picture if you need something for your model or whatever theres a couple things we could suggest so if you look at the supplement weve actually been disclosing the markets nii number for some time in the supplement so you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time if you regress that thing against the fed funds rate youll actually see that there is a pretty clear negative correlation there and so you can draw some conclusions from that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 but i just will point out that like in any given moment relatively small changes to the mix of the markets balance sheet can really change the nii quite significantly even in an environment of no policy rate changes so its sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection erika najarian q analyst ubs very clear thank you my second compound question is on capital if you could give us an update i know that january is the adoption date for saccr if you could give us an estimate on the impact to cet1 and just to clarify that mediumterm rotce does take into account that your gsib surcharge is jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so let me do the second one first so in short yes so as i said in the script we are not assuming any recalibration in that target so that does mean gsib in the equity component of that number in terms of saccr the impact of saccr adoption was about billion of standardized rwa so i think if you do the math thats like sic basis points of cet1 erika najarian q analyst ubs thank you operator our next question is coming from john mcdonald from autonomous research please proceed john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey jeremy want to follow up on that maybe a broader discussion of how youre managing the capital constraint with slr and the rising gsib and what does it mean for balancing share buybacks which obviously reduced this quarter preferred issuance and other levers that you have jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so as you know john in terms of share buybacks thats at the bottom of our capital stack so to the extent that were seeing robust loan growth other opportunities to invest in the business as well as potential ma opportunities those are all going to come ahead of buybacks and so i dont want to sort of guide on our buyback plans for next year which under scb as you know are really quite flexible as a function of the earnings generation outcomes the capital build but you can kind of draw your own conclusions in terms of the growth in the minimums that we see in the future as well as the loan growth as well as some of the investments that were making and frankly were kind of happy about that we want the capital to be used that way rather than being used for buybacks john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then as the followup maybe compound followup the new cet1 target or way you expect to kind of run this year if you could clarify that and also any color on the modest normalization of the ficc and equities wallet that you could flesh out jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so in terms of the target i said previously that was not off the table and that remains true depending on the outcome of the rule set depending on the basel iii end game depending on all the various components you can see a world where remains the minimum but as you can see as i said in the response to erika a second ago the target assumes something closer to as a function of the expected increases in gsib and some other factors so were kind of going to operate in that type of the range throughout the year with obviously the flexibility that we have oh and then sorry you also asked about normalization of markets and ib fees i mean i would say if youd asked me in the middle of the year we were talking a little bit about thinking that a reversion to run rates was a thing that like could happen in theory the way we feel right now our central case is obviously that we will see some normalization from exceptionally strong performance both in ib fees and in markets but i think were expecting that normalization to be a little bit less like nowhere near all the way down to the levels partially because the banking pipeline is really very robust we feel good about the kind of organic growth in equities and some of the share gains there and then in fixed income weve already seen a decent amount of normalization there actually and as the monetary policy environment evolves next year that could actually create some tailwinds for that business john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you operator next up we have glenn schorr from evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you very much i wonder if i could ask a little followup on the expense side slide is great tells a lot out first im curious on if i overgeneralize and say youve called structural comp normalization of te investment and thank you i just saw the further breakout in the bottom of the slide but the question i have is how much of that the card volume the investments has investments made in other words you made either ma deals or investments over the last like months how much of that is related to that coming through the pl or straight up brandnew investments for entering for all those items that youve listed below jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right okay i think i get your question glenn so number one to the extent that weve done some ma over the last months as you allude to and that that has introduced some expenses into the run rate the run rate impact of that is in the billion indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 its a relatively modest contribution off the top of my head i want to say its probably like million or something like that so could be a little bit more depending on some factors so thats one point the other point is that there are different types of investments here so if you look at for example the change in the marketing expense and the marketing investments that come through marketing expense in card a lot of the decisioning of that actually happened as part of the reopening in the middle of the year so thats actually already in the run rate whereas other aspects of the investment agenda are obviously things that were executing now expanding in places hiring people hiring technologists to do things that we need to do so hopefully that answers your question glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi think so and maybe if i can just ask a very general question i think people get normalizing capital market and a higher investment spend and that has got you falling short of the over time target the question the simple question i have is is the fact that you mentioned multiyear shortfall is that a function of timing of nii going full run rate with the timing of capital markets fall off and the higher denominator as you just mentioned with johns question indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so glenn your line is breaking up a tiny bit but i think i basically hear your question and i think the simple answer is yes so in other words were sort of saying that as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways so that includes policy rate normalization rate curve normalization as well as run rate normalization in markets revenues with the sort of some background expectation of growth there markets and investment banking revenues with a background expectation of growth and when all of that plays out and is finished playing out we believe we should be back to all else equal so you can kind of see its not that long if you know what i mean in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and glenn id just like to add we dont really know about and id be very cautious in that plus i expect more interest rates increases in the implied curve and obviously the worlds very competitive i also want to point out that a return on tangible equity if we can get that for the rest of our lives would be exceptional reconfirming that thats kind of what we think we can do is pretty good glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you for all that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co by the way i would take on tangible equity for the rest of my life if i can guarantee that operator next up we have a question from ken usdin from jefferies jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey good morning i wanted to ask you just a couple more questions on loans you mentioned that youre starting to see some better activity i wanted to just ask if you can kind of just flesh out what youre seeing across corporate lending commercial lending noticing that the wholesalerelated commitments were actually down sequentially so can you kind of just talk us through what clients are saying and doing and just how strong can that rebound on the corporate and commercial side could we see as we go forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure yeah so in terms of ci loan growth as i said in the script we are seeing an uptick in revolver utilization rates especially in the commercial bank and it remains sort of skewed to the smaller clients but we are starting to see an uptick in that actually even in the bigger clients so thats i guess an encouraging sign one of the things ive heard from the folks who run those businesses is that one driver of that is ceos and management teams who have been burned by low inventory levels as a result of the supply chain problems wanting to run higher inventories and that is maybe driving higher utilization there which as a result while it would i guess theoretically be a relatively permanent increase in utilization is not a thing that you can sort of project forward in terms of compounding the growth but at the same time were also hearing really quite a bit of confidence in the csuites and all else equal that should be positive for ci loan growth but clearly the levels there are modest still in a world where capital markets have been exceptionally receptive to investment grade issuance in particular and more recently to high yield issuance throughout the sort of pandemic period and so people are well funded from capital markets issuance ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay second question is just on fees there are couple of zigs and zags in mortgage banking security servicing which were both down a little bit more than expected and card did get a little bit better can you just kind of give us a little bit of color on the drivers of each of those please thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so theres a lot of stuff in there so let me do mortgage and card so in mortgage youll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there so theres a few drivers of that one is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flowthrough of the loanspecific pricing adjustments so thats one factor in addition you actually we did despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter for originations and for funded loans as we started to see higher rates towards the end of the quarter we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume and so on so thats little bit of a factor and then theres this sort of the normal organic dynamics where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage with rates selling off a little bit jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 so you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy and obviously with higher rates we expect things to be weaker next year were still predicting a trillion mortgage market next year which by historical standards is very robust so thats that part and then in card i imagine that youre looking at the card income line where we had a significant drop last quarter and this quarter the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high so youll remember that for card income we had a sort of oneoff item last quarter depressing the number this quarter we have another sort of oneoffish type item which is the impact of the southwest cobrand renegotiation which is public so thats contributing to the card income line and to the revenue rate a little bit but its important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization contra revenue expense which as you know amortizes over months and so as i mentioned earlier as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement as part of the reopening in the middle of the year we ramped that up quite significantly point offers in the market and stuff like that and so thats coming through the number so as a result when you look at the sort of fullyear revenue rate for card of around we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset obviously by expected growth in nii with the revolve narrative that weve laid out while we wait for the next question yeah sorry no go ahead go ahead operator so that question is from jim mitchell coming from seaport research jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning just you guys are doubling the investment spend so clearly seeing success in the prior efforts so can you just give us a little bit big picture discussion on what youre seeing from a return on investment standpoint and what timeframe because i think you kind of alluded to still being a little bit subpar on return so does that mean the payback is a little longer and you still expect significant growth in investment spend in jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so i mean at some level the question that youre asking is this perennial question of how can we be sure that the investments that were making are paying back and on what timeline and how do we measure that and its interesting we were just talking about card marketing i think of that as a continuum you have a continuum of investments that start with card marketing where every dollar that we put into card marketing investment is part of a very sophisticated extremely datadriven highly measurable set of decisioning to ensure that all of those are accretive and when we have sort of measurable outcomes in the short term so theres a lot of signs there and its pretty precise and you get feedback pretty quickly at the other end of the continuum is tech modernizationtype stuff which is a big part of the theme right now and those things are things that are just we obviously need to do them if we dont do them well be clunky and inefficient and hamstrung in the future when were trying to compete and its impossible to prove in some narrow financial sense that theres a tangible return payback from that but we know that theyre absolutely mandatory jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 so when we think a little bit about the revenue outlook in our kind of normalized run rate we are certainly assuming that many of the investments that were making now and that weve made over the last couple years will produce the revenues that we expect in that time horizon but a lot of what were doing is not of that nature and in some sense those are actually the most important investments because theyre the hardest decisions to make jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and some are very basic opening branches is million a year obviously the payback comes over time adding thousands of salespeople kind of know pretty much what the payback is but obviously it comes over time and so its a whole mix and just think about it as expenses you should expect will go up a little bit in jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners right thats the top one then just a followup on just on the nii i think futures markets are now pricing in four hikes i think you have three in your assumptions if we do get four hikes starting in march is that a material change to the nii outlook for this year in your models jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so if you look at the bottom lefthand side of page footnote in extremely small print you will notice that the implied curve that we use is from january so you can take that curve and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveats that i wont give you and draw your own conclusions but i mean it should be a modest increase modest additional tailwind very modest jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co while we wait for the next question i said something inaccurate before i realize i wasnt that confident when i said it the billion standardized rwa increase in saccr if you do the math is obviously not basis points of cet1 its basis points of cet1 so correction coming through there operator next we have a question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so a couple of questions first on the nii outlook could you give us a sense as to whats embedded in that with regard to your thoughts on how balance sheet shrinkage at the fed right the qt is going to impact the liquidity pool and then how much of that liquidity pool you currently are assuming is going to get redeployed into the more duration in your forward look jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so i mean i forgot exactly what the markets assuming about the start of qt at this point qt2 as theyre now calling it but from last time i looked closely there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of qt2 maybe people are now starting to accelerate that but in any case the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly and therefore the impact on systemwide deposit growth should be quite modest this year and our assumptions are consistent with that in other words were not assuming lots of deposit growth next year because ultimately thats going to be primarily as a function of the fed balance sheet size but obviously we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of qt if you know what im saying and so then in terms of deployment you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter it was primarily in the front of the curve so were still being quite cautious about really buying duration but and if you look at again page you notice that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that billion increase thats tagged as balance sheet growth and mix so its reasonable to assume that we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict but it shouldnt be too dramatic betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then my second question is just on the investments the billion that youve got incremental here and i assume that this is built up bottoms up from business unit leaders requests to do everything that you mentioned in the call and my question here is what percentage roughly like just gut numbers but what percentage are you giving them this year in other words did they ask for youre giving them and we should expect another uptick materially in i know jamie you mentioned billion is the run rate that we should grow from next year but im kind of asking a slightly different question which is how much of what they need are you giving them this year and a subset question is at what point does this fully fund your ability to get into the cloud for us consumer jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay can i answer that question we do not sit at a table and tell people you can only do x we sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do so think of it as its within our capability because some things we just simply cant do you cant attack funds at the same time or something like that thats number one so we want to make those kinds of investments each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary some of them are table stakes jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 i do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and doing npv i was like just dont do an npv just get it done its like thats just serving your client properly and stuff like that and like i said a lot i mean jeremy mentioned its branches in the united states its sites overseas its more countries its more products its all the things we should be doing that youd want to do if you owned of the company so it may not be what you would do if you have to meet nii next quarter of x y or z or something like that so and the second part of your question wasnt that it was oh the consumer digital and stuff like that were not going to start giving you real numbers and all that but that is a march thats a journey and its hard and we want to get there as soon as possible pieces and pockets have already gotten there so theres certain applications and certain datasets already running on the private cloud some are in the public cloud some parts of the company ahead of other parts of the company thats a lot of work and there is you guys have pointed out a little bit of what i call bubble expense in there were not going to disclose that either because then we just got to start disclosing other bubble expenses those are our responsibility and to the extent we have opportunities to do more we will do more because we have extraordinary capability and i think i just also want to point out jeremy mentioned the assumptions around capital i mean slr gsifi and multiple of the other calcs should be recalibrated okay even the regulators say these things should be recalibrated for the global size the global economy would you put capital against treasuries and capital against fed deposits and lets see what happens so on that were kind of conservative were not really expecting a lot of relief but even some of the folks yesterday that were being questioned fed prospects were being questioned about slr and acknowledged that there are issues around slr that are not good for the markets jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and betsy the only thing i want to add to that which i was going to basically say the same thing this whole like ask for and hope to get i mean we would we aim to manage the company much better than that so i certainly dont have that type of authority thats not the way it works and i think the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there so thats where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to do now whether its the right priority now whether we have the capacity to do it whether in the cases where the returns are measurable whether its producing the right returns and thats really part of how we operate the company and part of the discipline of the daytoday jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co if i can give you another example if we can spend billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow i would do that in a second betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but the step function that we see this year i mean given the pace of competition and the impact of everything thats going on its possible we could see this type of step function again jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its possible but if it happens it will be for a good reason jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co ive written about the competition theres global competition theres nonbank competition theres direct private lending competition theres jane street competition theres citadel competition theres fintech competition theres paypal competition theres stripe competition its a lot of competition and we intend to win and sometimes that means you got to spend a few bucks betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah all right i got it thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and i want to emphasize too embedded upon that as weve always said we want to be very very competitive in pay theres billion in merit increase theres a lot more compensation for our top bankers and traders and managers who i should say by the way did an extraordinary job in the last couple years delivering this stuff we will be competitive in pay if that squeezes margins a little bit for shareholders so be it operator next up we have steve chubak from wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so want to start off with a question on capital quarles highlighted in his swan song speech the potential for basel iv implementation increasing capital requirements as much as for select banks while we havent seen a formal proposal from the fed i was just hoping you could provide just some preliminary thoughts how youre handicapping the risk of higher rwa inflation ahead of basel iv adoption and to what extent is that contemplated in the updated rote guidance jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so steve jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co dont give too much theres like different things jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co this is fine its a perfectly reasonable question so okay so here we go so when you look at the current state of the socalled basel iii end game or basel iv proposals and you look at the rwa components of them in isolation youve got the change in the credit conversion factors which always equals a tailwind youve got the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 fundamental review of the trading book which is quite complicated and is going to depend institution by institution but is potentially for some folks a headwind and then youve got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized rwa and if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way you will conclude that theres a bunch of rwa inflation but couple things first this all takes place in the context of the global regulatory community or at least in the us saying that the system has enough capital it doesnt actually need more capital and its important to realize jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co which by the way anyone who does any real analysis at all would come to that conclusion jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and so its just important to realize steve that as you know obviously there are additional tools so the most important one of which is how the standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital and to standardize rwa and then in turn how that interacts potentially with the collins floor as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak potential double counting and the stress capital buffer against frtb and so on and so forth so the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall rwa inflation and the way we see the world we dont expect the basel iii end game in and of itself to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and you were conservative in saying its the gsib jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co exactly and we are allowing the gsifi increases to flow through to the medium term rotce assumptions steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for clarifying that and for not punting on the topic of basel iv just for my followup here jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just point out we will very very aggressively manage those things when we know the actual numbers like very aggressively manage them steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough jamie you certainly have the track record that supports that just for my followup on card payment normalization how are you thinking about the trajectory for card payment rates and just maybe to speak to your jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 confidence level that we see card payment rates return to prepandemic levels just given the emerging threats from bnpl that you cited and still elevated personal savings rates jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so i still to be honest get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios but i think its a little bit simpler if you just take a step back you look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that so theres a few things to note so the revolve rate having dropped quite a bit has more or less stabilized theres a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some omicron stuff but broadly its stabilized in the meantime the growth in overall card loans has now for several quarters in a row produced modest growth in revolving card balances and our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place so whats important about that is that were not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the prepandemic levels were simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth therefore contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth and so the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to nii growth in has very roughly speaking revolving balances getting back to the prepandemic levels by the end of roughly steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my question jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and sorry steve i think you had another was there another part of that question that i forgot steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no no thats sufficient thats perfect jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay great steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks so much jeremy operator next we have matt oconnor from deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 good morning as we think about the mediumterm target can you help frame what you think or whats being assumed on the efficiency ratio and then maybe on credit cost as well please jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so in terms of credit cost as i said were assuming a roughly normal credit environment at that point so that would mean card chargeoff rates back into the sort of low to mid type of thing as we said pre pandemic we were assuming we would get to especially as we underwrite some slightly higher loss vintages over time jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and building reserves as the loan books grow jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co importantly yeah exactly so i mean i would just broadly describe and consistently with the way were describing it which is kind of mediumterm guidance in a normalized environment that the chargeoff environment should in turn be normal so thats that and then youre kind of asking me i guess about the overhead ratio a little bit so personally i kind of dont love that measure i think its more of an output than an input and more often than not its driven by revenues not expenses and more often than not in the shortterm the revenue number thats swinging is a function of the rate curve so essentially the overhead ratio just becomes a proxy for the fed funds rate which makes it not a great management tool for the company but having said that in the assumptions that were using to build up that rate we do get back to something like a overhead ratio but as jamie said before if that number has to go up to deliver the right returns in the long term it will like we dont consider it to be a constraint matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay then obviously the math implies to get back to you have kind of outsized operating levers for a few years right i mean because i think the efficiency ratio goes the wrong way again in so a couple years of pretty big operating leverage right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co youve got to do your own models okay indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think for me in a world where there are inflationary pressures theres a lot of postpandemic effects in the numbers and we have some critical investments to make the notion of operating leverage at the level of the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 companys overall numbers for me becomes just not terribly meaningful im not sort of criticizing your question i understand why youre asking but its just kind of not the way we think about it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and i was just curious about jamie youre mentioning you still think rates will go up more than expected obviously expectations have moved up quite a bit and im just wondering kind of whats basing that opinion and on a side bar do you think the long end will go up more or if it hasnt gone up yet why will it from here thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah well firstly we prepare for all eventualities here were not kind of guessing at one but the consumer is very strong and with all respect to the fact there are people suffering still and covid and all that the fact is in spite of omicron in spite of supply chains was one of the best growth years ever and looks like it could easily be or which is actually pretty good the consumer has trillion more in their balance sheet their home prices are up asset prices are up jobs are plentiful wages are going up which is good for them were not against that and sharing the wealth a little bit of americas recovery with everybody so the consumer is in really good shape theyre spending i mean jeremy took you through the numbers more than spending precovid more and that number drives all the order books for everybody else whether its goods and services and obviously theres bouncing around between goods and services and all that kind of stuff like that businesses equally are in very good shape with cash and capability and confidence levels high what are they seeing theyre seeing their order books go up more cars more motors more patios more home improvements more homes more demand we have a shortage of homes in america so you see the table is set pretty well for the growth with obviously the negative being inflation and how that gets navigated and stuff like that so my view is theres pretty good chance there will be more than okay it could be or i mean i grew up in a world where you pole vault the rates up and just raise interest rates basis points on a saturday night and this whole notion that somehow its going to be sweet and gentle and no ones ever going to be surprised i think is a mistake that does not mean we wont have growth it does not mean unemployment wont stay in a good position and stuff like that so and the other fact is it may very well be possible that theyre long rates and im a little surprised how low theyve stayed but that the long rates may react more to the actual qe and then qt and so at one point the feds going to be letting run off billion or whatever number a month theyre going to come up with and there you may see loan rates react a little bit to that particularly what i just said about growth and demand for capital and stuff like that that also tends to drive 10year bond rates and all that so all things being equal if you look at the company and its a very important we have huge firepower to grow to expand to make loans to extend duration and you look at capital and liquidity i just want to point out trillion these numbers ive never seen a bank with them so and you look at percentages not just gross amounts trillion of cash and marketable securities trillion of loans okay theres billion or billion of those cash or marketable securities that could be deployed in higheryielding assets or loans when and if the time comes depending on all these capital constraints and stuff like that we have to deal with and those are extraordinary numbers theres trillion of deposits and we dont like taking risky deposits so those are they may go down a little bit in qt and all that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 but look at how this balance sheets funded ive never seen a bank balance sheet like that and think of that as kind of firepower over time as you navigate through the world and so were in pretty good shape and if i could own of the company itd be private matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc can i just sneak in based on all that i was thinking like the expense pressure or increase that were seeing at jpmorgan or expect to see in do you think this is indicative of the broader market as you talk to leaders outside of banks and they see the pipeline of volumes do you think theres going to be material surprises on expenses for the broader market thank you and then ill stop here jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i would expect that because almost every ceo is talking about wages and certain inflation and stuff like that but i just i dont want to be a ceo please dont say im complaining about wages i think wages going up is a good thing for the people who have their wages going up and businesses simply have to deal with changes in prices so if commodity prices go up and down mozzarella goes up and down wages go up and down ceos shouldnt be crybabies about it they should just deal with it the job is to serve your client as best you can with all the other factors out there and so im not opposed to it but i do think youll see more people seeing wage pressure et cetera and some have more ability to offset than others it hasnt stopped us from doing anything zero none nada were not cutting back on growth plans or bankers or markets or countries because theres some wage inflation operator next we have a question from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning just two very quick followups one jeremy in terms of capital deployment just talk to us about inorganic growth is there any likelihood that you look at any larger ma transactions use your currency at any point this year and should we see a slowdown or a letup in the pace of inorganic fintech investments that youve been on over the last year if you could address those two jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so the large transactions like over billions unlikely but well always look were always openminded were looking all over the place for things that fit in and stuff like that and then the pace of fintech investment and stuff like that that wont change at all jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats good can you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co my version of that which is consistent with jamies is that we continue to be interested in looking at ma and were doing that obviously yeah very large deals arent realistic and the fintech investment part is definitely part of the stuff that were looking at when we look at deals ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just doubleclicking on something jamie that you mentioned youve talked about venmo square banks leaving the ground open for fintechs over the last few years just talk to us to the extent you can how these investments clearly the market is focused on nearterm expenses rotce pressures but talk to us two years or three years fastforward how do you feel about jpm as a franchise competing with big tech fintech headtohead jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co great but its battle engaged i mean some of these people do a very good job i think theres certain things we or banks should have done so we should be a little selfcritical but we have the capability the economies of scale and all these things what were not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target thats just not even on the cards so and we have assets and strength look competition is very bright i mean theyre bobbing and weaving theyre not changing and theyre not static and i think sometimes people act like theyre static but theyre not static so but if we do a good job like today on consumer im sure thats all you chase customers free trading lot of atms youve got better and better service and more navigation bars more offers more travel more rewards more and youve got more of that coming and weve gotten friendlier in overdraft weve gotten and thats just one business thats true for every single business so i can look at it the other way around too if youre competing with jpmorgan that could be pretty tough competition like take chase uk weve been very very clear and that costs us money and a lot of you want payback tomorrow and stuff like that were not to disclose those numbers but we are there for the long run were going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives okay so i doubt over the long run well fail we may not become the best digital bank in the uk or somewhere in the short run ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you operator next we have mike mayo from wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jamie i hear youre ready to do an lbo on jpmorgan that youre so confident jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think youd help me raise the equity capital mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well thats what im trying to figure out here its a little frustrating this call because the guidance youve given has given all the bad news without any targets i mean youre saying we have to wait two years for the rotce despite the booming economy youre guiding for the second year in a row of negative operating leverage i get it thats not how you run the company but billion of investments thats up onehalf over the last three years and that billion is enough to capitalize the 11th largest us bank so i mean you gave us that but you didnt tell us what to expect from all this investment in terms of what specific market share gains are you targeting what specific revenues do you expect when do you expect that can you put some more meat on the bones here because just at billion of investment spend look it worked you gained share at billion of investment spend it worked you gained share but now youre going to billion and it might not always work so well so can you again put more meat on the bones the stocks down the feedback so far is like youre spending the rate hikes for investments over the next years thats great youre in there for the longterm but a lot of the investors arent planning to invest in a 10year horizon jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co michael i feel your pain and your frustration it is very possible in well have a rotce it depends on how we deploy our capital it depends on fixed income markets it depends on a bunch of stuff like that so with the branches that were building those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect the thousands of bankers were adding in private banking and chase wealth management were pretty sure well get to breakeven just as we expect but that takes a couple of years and so yeah were not going to tell you all of those things and we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just kind of we have to do it and theres a little bit of bubble expense in that theres even a little bit of bubble expense in the new headquarters and so were pretty comfortable were doing the right things and were being a little conservative like jeremy was talking about the card stuff the return i told our folks that were going to have card growth this year but they were skeptical the american consumer is very strong our products and services are very good chase we call it now self directed investing has billion i think robin hood has billion the last time i saw it or something like that were not sitting here bragging about our product because i would tell its not good enough yet but weve got billion without us doing virtually anything or no marketing and no real stuff like that so theres a lot of stuff coming you know the competition we have to face some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit maybe not exactly in but and i mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet were pretty conservative with the deployment of the balance sheet that may not always be true mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc ill followup and then ill requeue after my followup but as it relates to technology specifically jeremy you talked about retiring technical debt and so thats kind of playing defense but also on the offensive side where jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 are you investing for tech where you would expect some more revenues you talked about digital banking in the uk are you also going to brazil what other countries are you targeting for that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean its funny i wouldnt actually describe retiring technical debt as playing defense i mean i think thats actually a great example of the whole point of this conversation which is that retiring technical debt is an easy thing to not do if youre playing defense focused on shortterm targets but if youre playing offense for the long term its exactly this type of decision that creates some of the frustration that you are articulating thats critical for the longterm success of the company so thats i mean jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so we spent billion on brand new data centers okay which have all the cloud capability you can have in private data centers and stuff like that were still running the old data centers now were not going to get involved and every time we talk to you all explain every part of the pancake buildup of expenses going in and expenses going out but all this stuff going into these new data centers which are now completely up and running well some are but most of the applications that go in have to be cloudeligible most of the data that goes in has to be cloud eligible were running a whole bunch of major programs which i dont think we disclosed on aws and were working with google and microsoft to run some of the stuff in the cloud because we want to have multiple cloud capabilities and this year roughly of all our apps and all our data will be moving to cloudrelated type of stuff this stuff is absolutely totally valuable i mean i cant if you sat in this room and looked at the power of the cloud and big data on risk fraud marketing capabilities offers customer satisfaction dealing with errors and complaints prospecting its extraordinary you actually see some of that already in how we manage stuff like for example with all the fraud and all the cyber and all the ransomware our fraud costs were down this year theres a reason for that its because weve deployed huge capabilities in those things so we have to do those things and thats a march and it will be hugely valuable for us and youll see some of that benefit which is why were comfortable that well continue to grow and expand and earn like i said return on tangible capital i would take that if i could push a button and give you that for the next years i would take it and also if i did it for the next years that number would probably be like a big part of the gdp of the united states of america mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay ill requeue for my followup jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay operator we have one last question jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible michael asked another very good question about market shares we expect to go up in retail deposit market share investment market share private banking market share fixed income market share equity market share investment banking market share global market share payments market share and securities services market share commercial banking market share and what did i miss id be surprised if any of them go down and were not going to give you the number operator as per now we have one last question from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jeremy and jamie jeremy im trying to figure out what the discussion topics going to be first quarter of when we talk about fourth quarter numbers and i think it might have more to do with credit than were hearing about on the call today can you share with us the underwriting standards that you guys are using compared to what they were at the height of the crisis back in im assuming theyre easier today because the economy is stronger but also can you compare them to how does it look today versus what you guys were doing in jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so i think broadly for the company theres no really large change in our credit risk appetite and therefore in our underwriting standards i think i alluded a little bit to this earlier which is theres a subtlety in the card business where if you remember prepandemic we had talked about card chargeoff rates being at and maybe trending a little bit higher over time as a function of some underwriting of some slightly higher risk vintages still well within our credit box still within our overall credit risk appetite but just a slight shift in the composition of the portfolio there so that happened back then and we just didnt see it flow through because of obviously the extraordinary dynamics that we experienced with the pandemic and now were exiting the fourth quarter this year with a card net chargeoff rate and i forgot the exact number but something like or something so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co which youll never see again jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co obviously exceptionally low so the question then becomes like and then i think somewhere in your question there was also about like when we sort of leaned into the reopening how did we modify the credit box and the standards and the answer to that is that we returned it essentially to the prepandemic level so we were obviously very confident in light of what we were seeing about what consumer credit conditions were jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co it got tight a little bit and now its back to where it was in jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co exactly exactly jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co none of that was completely material to results but one of the things in jeremys slide we should point out weve been overearning on credit for years and we expect that eventually to normalize you could argue how fast and what time but credit card has been numbers weve never seen in our lives middle markets been lower than ever wholesales been lower than ever mortgages have been lower than ever cards theyre all low eventually theyre going to normalize and then we kind of build that into our models and the other thing is with loan book and this is very important for your own modeling just assume as the loan book grows we will add reserves pretty much proportionate to the growth of the loan book all things being equal now we got cecl and all this stuff like that but so thats a flip to the negative obviously for next year that one item jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and so gerard to your point about the fourth quarter next year right i mean one lens to look at that through is what do we think the trajectory of normalization of card net chargeoffs is through the course of and i dont want to get into too much specific guidance there but the numbers that were putting on the page roughly assume that we get back to that kind of like low around the end of or early in terms of card net chargeoffs so yes on the one hand maybe well be talking a lot about the fact that those numbers are going up but they will have actually gone up exactly in line with our expectations gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and just as a quick followup jamie and jeremy you talked about the balance sheet the way it is today and all that liquidity and i think jamie you said billion could be put to use how long will you guys will it take you to get to a balance sheet and a mix of business that looks like you would have thought back in before this whole pandemic started and the balance sheet did what it did jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think were going to wait i mean again some of those things are outcomes of decisions you make based on client stuff but the real fact is we got basel iv a lot of changes and when all that happens well give you a little bit better update how were going to deploy capital and invest the balance sheet and stuff like that but were in no rush to reinvest part of that balance sheet well be very patient operator mike mayo would have another question mike your line is open please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thank you just more detail on the tech spend and what i asked before was on digital banking youre going to the uk what other countries are you going to again just looking for some more specifics at least on jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 digital banking and other tech areas where you expect a revenue pickup not just i mean you mentioned fraud and aml and ransomware and cyber and thats table stakes as you would say but as far as actually getting revenue growth from your tech investments and starting off with digital banking which new markets are you entering jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so on digital banking were not going to disclose specific countries that were going into when jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co theres one we are talking about for next year i think just one jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think just to validate mikes question as you know we have made this investment in c6 in brazil jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co right jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so brazil its not exactly the same its not a de novo build by us but were there were engaged its a significant investment and brazils like a very interesting country from a consumer banking perspective the digital play there is quite interesting so thats one example and obviously were thinking about additional places to go and well let you know when we do it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and the other tech investments where you could expect additional revenues what would that include i mean for example with your marketing and the degree youre using ai and big data for what kind of improved take rates do you have or just again looking for more specifics where you can provide it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i dont know im personally not a big fan of these types of like anecdotal individual like tech stories i mean theres cool stuff like were doing some aienabled lead optimization stuff in awm for example so i could come up with a list of like things like that but in reality its really much more about the embedding of the modernization and the digitization of the whole ecosystem as part of customer engagement and competition and making the company more efficient and all that type of stuff examples were like i spend million on x thats technology as opposed to like branch build or banker hiring as jamie says and you can then attach a tangible revenue outcome to that im sure we have some of those examples somewhere i dont have them with me maybe we can talk about them next quarter but i generally think that thats sort of gets into a lot of anecdotal stuff that distracts from the big picture jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay last one what is your total tech spend again i thought its on the deck how much of that is to run the bank versus change the bank and then as it relates to the cloud specifically what do you expect that was a bold move to move chase the core bank to the cloud what do you expect that to save once that gets done thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so couple things if you go back to my prepared remarks so its like 12ish billion a bit more run the bank change the bank and within the change agenda half again is kind of modernizationtype stuff as opposed to features and products so it gives you a little bit of a guide jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey mike im going to give you one example which may be a little helpful on this tech platform thing i think these numbers are accurate we did this a while ago card runs on mainframe which is quite good we have one of the most efficient most economic million accounts et cetera its been updated for years but its a mainframe system in the old data center when it gets modernized to the cloud the cost savings by running that and marginalizing it will be million or million a year that isnt the reason were doing it the reason were doing it is once you get that to the cloud that the databases that it uses to feed its risk marketing fraud realtime offers and stuff like that become accessible to an enormous amount of machine learning so that you can when mike mayo is going home on a friday night we can offer you we know what you like to eat eat at a steak house you eat here immediately offers and for stuff that is times what it is today and so thats the real value the value isnt the immediate cost save that youve gone from youre saving million running this application here i want the million and the other thing it allows you to do is to augment that mainframe system when you touch a mainframe system youve got to be a little careful when you go into it and make some modifications so like in the old days you used to modify that mainframe system four times a year big releases and stuff like that of course for multiple reasons now you can go in and modernize a little piece of it every week every day and so thats why its so important to do this and its also makes it why its hard to quantify the benefits and the costs jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co but mike just to pick one example i guess from a business that i know you know well if you look at teresas securities services business its an interesting example of the way the investment relates to the strategy so in that business as you know historically winning new mandates especially in fund services administration tended to involve significant correlated large increases in expense as you had to onboard a lot of fund accountants and so that was typically the dynamic there and i think a lot of the investment that were making there is to make that business a little bit more scalable in that respect so that when we win new business its a little bit more accretive so thats kind of an interesting example of is that tech investment that produces more jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 revenue i mean i guess i would describe it as investment that means that when we win the revenue its more profitable for example at the same time were also building out some really great capabilities in there in terms of data and stuff like that which maybe will help us win more mandates jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and then we got to end this call because weve got some other stuff that weve got to do just for example this is an important one and teresa deserves all the credit for this we are now using jpmorgans investment banking derivative capability to help clients who use derivatives for custody to value them and stuff like that a lot of people simply cant do that and of course believe it or not a lot of portfolios now theyre using more and more what you and i would call derivatives as part of the portfolio management that costs time it costs money its on the cloud its hugely valuable to teresa having a competitive advantage mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you
