financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks don and good morning everyone as we noted in this mornings press release mts results continue to be impacted by the economic slowdown brought on by the covid19 epidemic and the return to a zero interest rate policy by the federal reserve our clients both consumer and commercial have adjusted to the new economic reality which is reflected on our balance sheet by a slowdown in some loan categories and notably higher levels of deposits in light of the challenging economic environment our focus has shifted somewhat from capital distribution to capital strength as far as the impact on mt goes the low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in our net interest income payment related fees suffered from the reduced level of economic activity due to the pandemic related lockdowns however lower rates also led to a improvement in mortgage banking revenue compared to the first quarter trust income remained solid and operating expenses were well controlled the net result provided a solid foundation to support expected credit costs while also improving our capital ratios in connection with the cecl loan loss accounting standard which reflects our assessment of the future economic conditions as of the end of the quarter we added million to our allowance for credit losses the common equity tier ratio improved by basis points to indicating that mt is well positioned to meet the needs of our customers and our communities now lets review the results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the second quarter of compared with in the first quarter of and in the second quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis mts second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur mts net operating income for the second quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in last years second quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2020s first quarter and in the second quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the first quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 turning to the balance sheet and the income statement taxable equivalent net interest income was million in the second quarter of down by million from the linked quarter this primarily reflects the lower interest rate environment following the federal reserves emergency reduction to its fed funds target late in march these cuts led in turn to a basis point decline in average onemonth libor compared to the first quarter overall average interestearning assets increased by billion to billion while the net interest margin declined by basis points to compared with in the linked quarter the governments fiscal and monetary policy actions were the primary drivers of our significant balance sheet growth in the quarter first loans made through the paycheck protection program or ppp added billion to average loans for the quarter a significant portion of ppp funds currently sit in customer deposit accounts waiting to be deployed those ppp derived deposits in combination with other stimulus programs led in turn to a billion or increase in our placement of cash at the federal reserve bank of new york those large balance sheet movements had a similarly large impact on the net interest margin cash held at the federal reserve reduced margin by an estimated basis points while having little effect on net interest income the ppp loan portfolio was additive to net interest income during the quarter but the combined impact of income and balances diluted the margin by about basis points the lower interest rate environment caused an estimated basis points of pressure to the margin the net impact of lower rates was somewhat mitigated by a basis point decrease in the cost of interestbearing deposits all other factors amounted to another basis points of margin pressure average total loans increased by billion or compared with the previous quarter looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans increased by billion or including the billion of average ppp loans ci loans grew by nearly million excluding the ppp activity largely the result of having line draws on the balance sheet for a full quarter net of repayments we saw a somewhat unusual decline in dealer floor plan balances as customers return to showrooms faster than manufacturer inventory could be shipped commercial real estate loans grew by compared to the first quarter residential real estate loans declined by just over or million which primarily reflects the continuing measured rate of paydowns on acquired mortgages loans purchased from servicing pools pending resolution partially offset those paydowns consumer loans were up less than reflecting higher indirect recreation finance loans partially offset by lower auto loans and home equity lines of credit on an endofperiod basis the ppp portfolio more than offset a net contraction of other commercial and industrial loans reflecting paydowns of about half of the line draws that occurred late in the first quarter and a billion decline in floor plan loans cre and consumer loans each grew a little over while consumer real estate loans declined slightly average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman islands office and cds over grew or over billion compared with the first quarter that figure includes billion of non interestbearing deposits the factors driving the change included cash from the government stimulus programs held in both commercial and consumer accounts and higher levels of mortgage servicing escrow deposits these in turn led to the higher placement of cash at the fed mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 on an endofperiod basis core deposits were up billion or reflecting those same factors foreign office deposits decreased on an average basis and on an endofperiod basis as on balance sheet sweep rates returned to historic lows turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the recent quarter included million of valuation gains on equity securities largely on our remaining holdings of gse preferred stock while the first quarter included million of losses also recall that during the first quarter of mt received cash distribution of million from bayview lending group there was no such distribution in the second quarter mortgage banking revenues were sic million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were billion in the quarter up from million in the first quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were million in the second quarter improved from million in the prior quarter the increase reflects the higher volume of loans originated for sale combined with stronger gain on sale margin partially offset by lower servicing income commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the second quarter compared with million in the linked quarter the comparable figure in the second quarter of was million trust income was million in the recent quarter up slightly from million in the previous quarter the rebound in equity markets from first quarter lows good capital markets activity and million of seasonal tax preparation fees were all factors during the quarter more than offsetting the emerging impact of money market fund fee waivers in the zero interest rate environment service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the first quarter covid19 related waivers of many of the consumer service charge categories and a slowdown in overall payments activity were the primary factors contributing to the decline the million linked quarter decline in other revenues from operations reflects the bayview lending group distribution i mentioned earlier as well as lower payments revenues that are not included in service charges such as credit card interchange and merchant discount loanrelated fees including syndication fees also declined given the reduced pace of nonppp commercial loan origination activity operating expenses for the second quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were million down some million from million in the first quarter recall that operating expenses for the first quarter included approximately million of seasonally higher compensation and benefits costs the largest of which related to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirementeligible employees as usual those seasonal factors declined during the second quarter in addition we reduced our level of incentive accruals to reflect lower levels of new business activity following the pandemicrelated lockdowns the impact of the pandemic also led to a noticeable decline in certain other expense categories advertising and marketing costs declined by million compared with the prior quarter to under million other costs of operations for the second quarter included a million addition to the valuation allowance on our capitalized mortgage servicing rights a similarsized addition was made during the first quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 in addition travel and entertainment expense and professional services declined by an aggregate million the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2020s first quarter and in the second quarter of next lets turn to credit net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net charge offs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the second quarter compared to basis points in the first quarter the increased chargeoff activity largely relates to problem loans identified at the end of but whose deterioration was likely accelerated by the pandemicinduced economic slowdown the provision for credit losses in the second quarter amounted to million exceeding net chargeoffs by million and increasing the allowance for credit losses to billion or of loans the allowance currently reflects an updated series of assumptions reflecting a somewhat more adverse economic scenario than either of the scenarios used at january or march as well as the impact of proactive risk rating changes within our portfolio to reflect the current economic environment our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and gdp our forecast assumes the quarterly unemployment rate falls to in the third quarter of this year from a peak at in the second quarter followed by a sustained high singledigit unemployment rate through the forecast assumes gdp contracts during and recovers to prerecession levels by the second quarter of nonaccrual loans as of june amounted to billion an increase of million from the end of march at the end of the quarter nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans was its important to keep in mind that some of the usual credit metrics have been affected by the ppp loans on the balance sheet which are zero risk weighted and carry little or no credit risk excluding the impact of ppp loans the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans would be similarly the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans would be annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans would be basis points loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter and of those loans million or were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities consistent with agency guidance loans that have received some sort of relief whether payment deferrals covenant modifications or other form of relief as a result of covid19 related stress are not reflected in our non accrual or delinquency numbers as the virus spread in midmarch to early april our customers reached out for relief actions and support from the bank from that peak period request for relief from both commercial and consumer customers are down by about mts booked relief actions in the commercial portfolios have been heavily influenced by auto and recreation finance dealers those dealer relationships the vast majority of which are floor plan inventory account for billion of relief requests amounting to nearly of total dealer balances high levels of forbearance for dealers has been seen industrywide and given the strength in sales activity towards the end of the quarter we expect further extensions of relief to be limited excluding dealer relationships relief provided to commercial customers totaled billion comprising some of balances for the consumer portfolios we provided assistance to approximately accounts representing mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 billion in balances of our combined mortgage home equity line of credit and indirect recreation finance or auto portfolios amounting to about of total balances of interest approximately of that population made a payment in the month of june for mortgage loans that we dont own and that we service for others relief was provided to approximately accounts totaling billion turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated as of june compared with at the end of the first quarter this reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividend paid and lower risk weighted assets mt did not repurchase shares during the second quarter and will not be doing so in the third quarter turning to the outlook as we sit here today our outlook is somewhat clearer than it was days ago however there is still a fair amount of uncertainty as far as the balance sheet goes our liquidity assets shortterm investments and deposits at the fed rose somewhat beyond our expectations with both a rate and volumedriven impact on the net interest margin this was driven by inflows of deposits from the ppp loans and other government stimulus programs while the pace is uncertain we believe that recipients will use these funds and excess reserves will trend downward somewhat as we go forward any additional government stimulus programs would of course have an impact on those assumptions excluding the impact from cash and ppp loans the net interest margin experienced a basis point rate driven decline following a basis point decline in libor we expect average libor in the third quarter to fall a little further as well deposit rates given all factors we expect the printed margin will improve somewhat in the coming quarter we expect average ppp loans will increase from the billion average in the quarter toward the billion outstanding at june beyond that the rate of prepayment and forgiveness will significantly impact the balance retained as you know forgiveness under the program is not currently automatic and is subject to review by the sba while we expect significant numbers of forgiveness request before the end of the year its difficult to handicap how much will occur in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter commercial loan growth which is to say excluding ppp loans has slowed and we expect those balances to remain flat to slightly down over the remainder of compared to where we ended the quarter in a normal environment wed expect to see a seasonal slowdown in inventories and a corresponding decline in our floor plan loan balances during the third quarter recent vehicle sales volumes might necessitate dealers adding inventory against a backdrop of constrained production at the manufacturers and the upcoming model year changes residential real estate loans should continue to experience a measured pace of runoff as the vast majority of our loans are originated for sale however as i touched on earlier there are circumstances under which we can pursue buying delinquent loans or loans under forbearance out of the mbs pools we service as a result we have stepped up buyout from the ginnie mae pools which will lead to temporary growth in our residential mortgage loan portfolio these are government guaranteed loans so our credit risk is extremely limited wed expect to see some improvement in the growth of consumer loans compared with the recent quarter as recent indirect originations are on the balance sheet for a full quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 our outlook for net interest income is also somewhat dependent on the eventual resolution of the ppp loans while we expect net interest income to improve in the third quarter from the second the rate of improvement is also heavily dependent on the pace of forgiveness or prepayments on the ppp loans turning to fees residential mortgage applications continue to be very strong with rates as low as they are and purchase activity has held up well waivers of money market mutual fund management fees will continue to impact trust income while the zero interest rate environment persists well see a larger impact in the coming quarter than we did in the second quarter service charge income was impacted by lower levels of customer activity higher balances and statemandated waivers of certain consumer fees payments activity recovered by the end of the quarter however certain categories of retail fees continue to be waived in addition higher commercial deposit balances have enabled those customers to offset the hard dollar fees arising from their treasury management obligations through the use of earnings credit as we noted the seasonal increase in salaries and benefits we experienced in the first quarter largely normalized during the second quarter we have curtailed hiring and have been redeploying team members around the bank to address shifting business needs were in a similar situation to last year where we expect expenses in the second half of the year to be roughly the same as the first half excluding the first quarter seasonal salaries and benefits figure the third quarter is often higher than the fourth quarter from an expense perspective in the cecl loan loss accounting environment our allowance for credit losses at the end of the quarter reflects the macroeconomic variables i referenced earlier the impact of the government stimulus and the characteristics specific to our portfolio as gaap requires we will reassess the allowance at the end of the third quarter based upon updated macroeconomic scenarios and mts specific credit data finally regarding capital as noted at the beginning of the call were focused on capital strength consistent with the ccar results we dont expect to repurchase any shares during the third quarter and we continue to meet the federal reserve earnings threshold for dividend distributions of course as youre aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now lets open up the call to questions before which laurie will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc question for you on the net interest margin obviously youve cited the reasons why the margin came down so much this quarter and the ppp loans and the excess deposits certainly are contributing factors as you pointed out when you look at your asset yields the loan yields in particular they came down quite steeply your cost of funding not as much as we go forward do you sense that the asset yields in the loan portfolio the decline will start to diminish but youll still see continued reductions in the cost of funding darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah gerard when we look through the composition of the balance sheet i think you saw that the yield on the ci loans in particular came down with the cre loans that tends to be where the hedging impact those and well see those come down through time we also did see a nice decrease in the deposit cost a significant portion of our deposit costs now are linked to the index and so they came down proportionately and so when we look forward if you hold the cash and the ppp aside and look at what we would consider to be the core margin we think we wouldnt expect to see a drop like the basis points that we saw this past quarter that it would be more tied to movements in libor which given how close we are to zero we would expect to be pretty minimal and so we would see relatively small movements in the yield on loans and similarly small yield in the deposit costs with probably the minimal exception of some of the managed costs where time deposits are still repricing and there will be some of that go on through the second half of the year as well as some of the other managed deposit costs like some of the money markets and the like so probably all else equal we follow libor and maybe trickle down a couple of basis points in the core margin but as we kind of pointed out the printed margin will bounce around depending on how the cash balances move in the quarter as well as the ppp funding gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as the followup question you obviously built up your reserves this quarter mt has distinguished itself as one of the best banks through a full cycle on credit if the economic outlook does not deteriorate from the period that you just came through in which you made your assumptions for the reserve buildup and granted youll have some reserves for any loan growth should we anticipate provisions for loan mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 losses coming down in third or fourth quarters assuming this economic outlook doesnt deteriorate from this quarter under cecl accounting darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well i guess the math would say if the economic assumptions are identical then the provision wouldnt really change with the exception of reflecting loan growth net loan growth and perhaps by category so if you had a mix a meaningful mix change you would see an increase but all else equal as you point out you probably see the provision not moving much and the action would be predominantly actual chargeoffs gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc but would the provisions still be at this level though i mean because you built up reserves so much assuming life of loan losses darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp the provision would only be impacted by net loan growth if the assumptions macroeconomic assumptions were unchanged gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester of compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i appreciated the detail on the deferrals in some of those loan buckets i was just wondering what the total amount was at the end of the quarter if you happen to have that or the current total in terms of the total amount of loans in deferral and then if you happen to have the criticized or classified asset trends for the quarter that would be good to hear as well darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so well get you the sum of the loans in forbearance or with some kind of payment relief when you look at the nonaccrual loans the nonaccrual loans bumped up by million for the quarter more action was in the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 criticized space and a lot of that was related to some of the forbearance activity and so as we went through the portfolios and we looked at loans that were in forbearance we took them down a grade or two depending on where they started and that was really the primary driver of an increase in criticized but most of them are just past just over the threshold that we would start to consider criticized back to the balance figure of whats in forbearance in aggregate for loans that we own its about billion about billion commercial and about billion for consumer which would include the mortgage portfolio that we own and then if you add in what we service for others theres another 13odd billion but thats not our credit risk and i guess its important to point out that as we come to the end of the quarter were getting close to the end of some of the 90day forbearance period and within that commercial portfolio theres a large amount billion or around there of commercial or dealer floor plan balances and we are not seeing a lot of activity in extension requests and so we would expect that number to start to come down as we go into the third quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then for the total amount of criticized loans you have at the end of the quarter what were those darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp we typically dont disclose that until the 10q comes out david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay got you but it sounds like those were up i guess commensurate with some of the other deterioration that you guys would see darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes its primarily because of the downgrades that we talked about david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yes got it and then just switching to the nim quickly just so i understand youre saying that the core nim moves a little bit lower but the reported nim with all the impacts on cash and whatnot could actually be higher if cash does actually decline in the next quarter or two is that what youre saying darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thats right yes david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and i was just curious just looking at the balance sheet you have decent amount of borrowings there your cash grew more than your entire borrowing balance this quarter are there any opportunities where you can mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 whittle away at that balance over time i realize you may have some builtin prepayment penalties that you have to run into but any opportunities on that side darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes i guess if you look around we probably given where rates are wouldnt be taking on any duration risk at this point with converting it into mortgagebacked securities but would prefer to stay short well have some long term debt that will mature and roll over we wont replace that in the short term we can take advantage of those balances for funding and then well probably use some of it as we mentioned in balances in the mortgage servicing business where we would buy out some of the loans that are being modified and take them out of the pools and well use some of the excess cash to fund those in the short term david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and going back to the rolloff of the borrowings whats the schedule for that look like over the next year do you have any lumpy rolloffs that could really help the nim in any of these quarters darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp theres everything is swapped so the savings is not materially large david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay got it great thanks guys appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the reserve have you actually on your loss expectation have you run your internal company run stress test yet for dfast or have you disclosed it darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp we dont run company stress anymore as part of the being a category four bank mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right so the so i guess i just want to see if you could help think about the reserve level now at the thats about half of the last time you did run the publicly disclosed company run stress tests in and so how should we could you help us kind of triangulate that reserve coverage where it stands now versus the stress loss estimate is it really the macro assumptions behind it and dialing in of stimulus that you can attribute to that difference darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well i guess theres a number of factors john to think about when looking at that level of allowance i guess the first place that i start is we think about it more as as opposed to which is i know splitting hairs but just because of the ppp loans and the fact that theres no credit risk there or very little and then when you compare the ccar process to the cecl process there are a couple of key differences one is the assumptions that you mentioned there are the stress test is specifically designed to really put the bank under stress and so when you look at some of the assumptions the depth of the decline in gdp and the length of time it stays at those depths the drop in unemployment while we saw a bigger drop in unemployment in the short term when you look at where that trends out over the last four to six quarters of the projection its actually not as bad as what ccar would have and so there are some parts of the macroeconomic assumptions that are different a key difference would be hpi and that weve seen hpi hold up really strong right now and the decrease in hpi is a lot different in our economic assessment today than what it would be under stress another really key difference is within ccar you assume that all or we assume that all nonaccrual loans chargeoff and we know thats not our experience in the cecl allowance our cecl process would reflect our experience at recovering or curing those customers that are in nonaccrual and so those are some of the differences between the two i guess the thing that we look back to two is how the portfolio and the underwriting performed under the great financial crisis and what the actual losses were during that and what the peak losses were and when we compare the portfolio to what we saw in that crisis which was more financial driven crisis obviously than as widespread as the pandemic we look at where our reserving ratios are relative to what happened then and so cecl more so reflects our underwriting experience than ccar might where you use a little bit more of industry information and industry level losses and so those are a bunch of the things that go on underneath and were doing work i think we talked about it during the quarter rené talked about it of the portfolios where we see the forbearance the highest really literally going bottomsup and credit by credit to understand what we think their cash flow is and their ability to sustain revenue shortfalls for periods of time and looking at the values of the collateral and how they might hold up under stress and all of those different things are factors in our thought process when we set the allowance and so its thorough but it reflects both the economic environment and the view we have of our portfolio john pancari q analyst evercore isi mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 thats very helpful thanks for all that color and then separately just wanted to see if i can get a little bit more granularity around the underlying commercial demand that youre seeing on the loan book it sounds like understandably given that you expect commercial balances to remain flat to slightly down sounds like not a lot of underlying commercial demand but just wanted to get your updated view on what youre seeing live in terms of borrower demand given where we stand right now in the pandemic darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes weve definitely seen a slowdown in demand i think ppp helps create some of that slowdown because the customers were able to take advantage of those programs but really whats encouraging to us that weve seen is a really rapid reaction by the customers to the new operating environment and weve seen them make changes to their business to manage the burn rate of expenses and so when you look at how theyre running their business part of this you will see reflected in the deposit balances the pace of turnover in their operating accounts isnt what it was prepandemic and so when you factor that in along with some of the ppp funds and their ability to manage theyre very liquid and thats a great thing from a credit perspective because they can withstand a longer slowdown in economic activity but it doesnt necessarily lead to a lot of loan demand in the shortterm and so thats really whats going on there but from our perspective when we look at how the customer base has actually responded were quite pleased with what we see and the customers i would say are quite sanguine about whats going on i think were in that period right now where for our part of the country we got through the hard hit that happened in april and may were starting to see a rebound and our customers are guardedly optimistic about how things are how they will unfold but cautious and all of that is whats leading to that forecast john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to start just to followup on the reserve how much of the reserve build this quarter was tied to the change in economic forecast as opposed to portfolio specific changes and were qualitative overlay is a material factor this quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so if you look at the allowance the biggest driver of the increase in or the provision was the economic forecast when you look at the moves in the grades in some cases the grades moved by one or two and those arent generally the pd the loss assumptions under those changes arent big enough swings to cause a meaningful move in what you think your loss rates would be its really as you get up into the criticized and even beyond the criticized into nonaccrual where you really start to see an uptick in those rates i would describe it as the grading that happened this quarter kind of caught up a little bit to the macroeconomic assumptions that were in the model at the end of the first quarter and so those are the drivers there and when you look at the qualitative overlays we really didnt change the overlays from an economic perspective in terms of the impact of the stimulus that was pretty consistent from quarteroverquarter i would say the place where there was a qualitative overlay was looking at some of the instances in the models where they havent seen these types of inputs in terms of gdp changes and unemployment and in worse economic conditions tend to overpredict losses and so for certain portfolios where we went through bottomsup and looked at what we thought our loss was we kind of took that into account and made an overlay but really not much change quarteroverquarter and not tremendously significant steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then one of the areas that is a focal point for you guys is new york city commercial real estate exposure as you know darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc could you give us whats the balance today what are you seeing there what are deferral requests in that bucket any color would be helpful thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so within new york city i think when you look in the 10k including construction the balances are right around billion actually sorry a little bit high billion and when we look at the requests for forbearance they havent increased since what we saw in the first quarter and when you walk down the portfolio by category if we look at the industrial type of space its really quite small and thats the least impacted segment were still seeing rents collection rates of plus there and low levels of forbearance with the multi family portfolio which in total exposure including construction is about million were still seeing rent receipts above in fact they went up slightly in july compared to what they were in april and we havent seen any increases in requests for forbearance there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 the office space continues to also see some slight upticks in rent being collected slightly over which is up from what it was in april although not totally meaningfully hotel is probably one of the little more challenged portfolios in aggregate at least in terms of the economic impact although the ability of the clients to handle things has been quite strong and so the forbearance rates there are the highest upwards of plus but whats interesting is when we look at the forbearance rates across the whole hotel portfolio they arent materially higher in new york city than they are across all other geographies and we have seen through our card activity that hotels are people are going back to hotels the in the retail world which is another relatively large portfolio and where theres probably the next highest level of forbearance activity after the hotel portfolio is about billion and interesting thats probably where weve seen the biggest increase in rents being paid since april and now is up over from being slightly above before and so the new york city portfolio is so far holding up well were seeing some trends that are positive in terms of payments ultimately to the landlords and then i guess the other thing that we just we keep an eye on is what the loantovalues are in that portfolio versus any other and the loantovalues across all those categories in new york city tend to be to percentage points lower than what the ltvs might look like in a similar asset class in the rest of the footprint and so its still early days and so far too early to declare victory but the trends and the change in the trends from early in the quarter to the end of the quarter havent deteriorated and arguably are slightly more positive steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thats more color than i was hoping for thanks for taking my questions darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure thing operator your next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning matt donald j macleod a administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp hey mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the ppp loans are a pretty big part of your loan portfolio bigger than i think a lot of your peers and if we just think about the origination fee that youll get on that it seems like a pretty decent chunk relative to earnings capital reserves can you just give us an estimate on what you think the blended origination fee is on the billion and how much you think will be forgiven or repaid the next few quarters in aggregate darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes so the blended fee on the loans is probably somewhere between and and the pace of forgiveness is as we said a little bit tough to handicap although as we think about it matt theres a couple of things there the change to the program rules extended the time that the customers had to actually use the money and so that pushes out the time period for the forgiveness we thought a bunch of it originally and we and the industry that it would be starting even as early as late in the second quarter now that could push all the way into the fourth quarter and so we expect forgiveness in the second half of the year probably in the range of to but how much is in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter i guess conservatism would lead us to say we think its a little bit more backend loaded in the fourth quarter than the third but it remains to be seen and the other thing thats still just kind of hanging out there is the rules for forgiveness are still in consideration and will there be any automatic forgiveness or not for the small loans i think those things will impact the timing that the longer it takes for the rules to be clear on forgiveness i think thats that will have two impacts it will slow down when that actually happens and when those fees get accelerated and then the second thing that will happen is i think customers are being cautious about when they use the money and so that sits on the balance sheet while they want to make sure that they spend it appropriately so that they have a better chance of having their loans forgiven and so its a little bit fluid in there but whats relatively certain is that that amount of origination fee or processing fee will come in over the next couple of years the timing of when that shows up is a little bit uncertain matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got you and then just separately the expenses were very wellmanaged this quarter the guidance for second half to be similar to first half kind of implies expenses might have been bloated expenses might have been unusually low is that a reasonable way to frame it because the cost came in a lot lower i think than anyone would have expected in and it doesnt seem like thats sustainable so i just want to make sure youre framing that right darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes i think youre in the right ballpark there we think that its closer to q2 obviously than it was to q1 but this is mt and when we see movements in revenue and headwinds then we take action on the expense side and thats kind of what happened in the second quarter and many of the things that we impacted in the second quarter should continue in the back half of the year mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 as we mentioned there might be a little bit of lumpiness just because of some seasonal things that happen third quarter versus fourth but if you average them out youre in the ballpark maybe slightly higher than q2 on average for each of those last two quarters with a bit of a mix difference between third and fourth matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got you okay thats helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning a question on the fee side of things darren just wondering if you can help us understand some of the lines are better some of the lines were worse and as you look out can you just talk about can those service charges rebound what do you see for mortgage and just what were the fee waivers this quarter and then what do they turn into thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so just kind of going category by category if you look at the mortgage business second quarter was a bangup quarter for us and for most of the industry whether we continue at that pace in the consumer space its difficult to say but seems unlikely but i dont think we go all the way down to where we were in the first quarter i would expect were somewhere in between we should continue to see some gainonsale just from where rates are and from some of the portfolios that were servicing where people will refi which will be offset a little bit by slightly lower servicing fees but netnet i would expect us to be in the range between where we were in the first and the second trust income you start to see a little bit of pressure on that line item just because of the fees that are associated with the money market mutual fund and the management fees and so well we might see a little bit of pressure there and then the service charge line is really the one that was impacted this quarter and its interesting when you look at it that the payment related fees so interchange have come back to where they were and up yearover year the biggest impacts are on some of the other line items some of the atm related fees where from some of the government programs staterelated programs were not allowed to charge for those and so those will be off the table until that changes and then one of the other big categories is nsf and nsf is lower mainly for two reasons theres less transaction activity and also higher average balances in customer accounts and then commercial account balances so i think longwinded way of saying i think we start to see service charges come back up through time but probably takes a couple of quarters to get back to the run rate we were at in the first quarter and then in some of the other income again youve got payment fees thats where the credit cardrelated fees are just because theyre not associated with deposit accounts and so interchange and merchant should come back with business activity mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 and then thats where some of the loan origination fees are like syndications and again as the as those markets pick up we will see those fees come back ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then just a followup on the fee waivers i think you talked last time that they could get to around million do you have any different view there and what were they this quarter thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp they were well they were slightly higher than that this quarter and i would expect them to be in that range in the third quarter and then well see how the how things unfold through the fourth just because they are more policy related im hesitant to comment on what they might go beyond the third quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc oh wait im sorry darren i meant the trust the trust the waivers with the money market fee waiver side darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp oh okay they were small in the second quarter i mean really not that significant and well start to see them go up as we go forward maybe in the neighborhood of million a quarter something like million ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks very much darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah operator the next question comes from the line of saul martinez of ubs sir your line is open please state your question if your phone is on mute please unmute it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hello hi can you hear me sorry about that darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp we got you now saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 i had myself on mute yeah sorry about that so just wanted to make sure i understood the guidance on expenses and have my numbers straight so i think i mean you mentioned that it would be similar to second half versus the first half and stripping out some i guess some small amount of noncore items in the first quarter by my calculation that gets you a little under billion or lets just call it million to million a quarter which seems a little bit high versus what you kind of implied in your answer to matt so i just want to sharpen the pencil a little bit to make sure i kind of have the a little bit tighter range in terms of the outlook going in the second half of the year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure i think the difference might be the comment about first and second is its the same excluding the seasonal salary impact or similar excluding the seasonal salary impact and that by itself will be about million that youd exclude and if you were including that in the first equal second then youd get that higher run rate i think if you take the run rate that we saw in the second quarter and bump it up by million or million and think about that on average for the second half of the year youre probably in a better run rate saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it so basically second half normalizing to the seasonality basically darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thats right what youre saying saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it i must have misunderstood that okay and i guess on the nii another more of a clarification question as well i mean you gave a ton of color on the moving parts around net interest margin i probably got lost in all of it but i think the punch line was you do expect some uptick in net interest income in the third quarter versus the second and first i think just wanted to make sure that was right and are you is that outlook incorporating any of the ppp deferral gains that you talked about to in the second half fully realizing its completely uncertain and more fourth quarter tilted but is that view that you will have some nii growth dependent on some realization of ppp forgiveness gains darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes and then if you go in the third quarter we expect a slight uptick in nii and thats because some small amount of forgiveness starts to come in and then youll have a full quarter of the ppp loans outstanding and the amortization of the fee and then really youll start to see more of that weighted to the fourth quarter saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay but there is some that view that there is some uptick is incorporating some forgiveness and i guess the to is that i mean what if you could just clarify on that do you have a view of what percentage of the loans will be forgiven and is the to based on the percentage of forgiveness in other words of those mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 loans that are forgiven do you think to will be in the second half is that the right interpretation of what you said darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess so at the highest level when you look at the ppp loans youre probably up to over time like i said im kind of hedging my bets a little bit and thinking that maybe its more like or but we know is just again because of the rules about when the funds are supposed to be dispersed that it needs to happen by and large by the end of the year and then the question on timing is when the customers go and seek forgiveness and then how quickly the sba processes it its likely to be concentrated in the next three quarters and then there will be some the rest of it will hang on and show up kind of over the normal course of those two year loans and normal amortization but thats kind of how were thinking about it and as i said a little bit of that is in the third quarter which helps and then obviously whatever doesnt show up in the third quarter starts to show up in the fourth and the first of saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i fully realize its a very imprecise science but appreciate that thats helpful operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi i just had one quick followup question on the nim darren you said earlier that the net interest margin was impacted basis points by excess cash and basis points by ppp i think investors thought it was helpful and one of your peers said this morning what normalized nim could be could stabilize at as we look at your earnings power post all the ppp noise so if i exclude that i would get to net interest margin in the range and as i think about your outlook for libor decreasing but potentially offset by deposit costs as you think about second quarter third quarter of is low or high a good starting point for the margin darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes i think thats a good way to think about it that we talked about that if we look at the core earnings power of the bank and that basis points gets you down to where we would be absent those large increases in cash balances at the fed as well as ppp and you probably see that move down small amounts per quarter just as the different hedge activity rolls on and rolls off that the way the hedges were constructed through time that the received fixed rate on the hedges will slowly come down and that will create some headwinds the flipside is this the loan activity that is happening weve seen some increases in the margin on that and so that will help offset so i think youre thinking about it right youre in the ballpark of how we would see it without those factors really the one of the big questions in the printed margin and i would just kind of hold this to the side just where the cash settles out mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator thank you i will now turn the call to don macleod for any additional or closing comments donald j macleod administrative vice president
