tremendous disruption in their personal and professional lives continue to come together as a team to support each other our customers and communities through the covid19 pandemic the last few weeks have certainly been challenging however our top priority is the health and wellbeing of our associates and customers in order to do our part to reduce the spread of covid19 we were one of the first banks to limit inperson branch activity through our drivethroughs and converted our office services to appointment only we also reopened previously closed locations to better serve our customers fortunately due to our footprint the majority of our branches have drivethrough capabilities and im proud that weve been able to keep of our branches open during this time additionally almost half of our associates are now working remotely our teams remain committed to delivering the financial advice and guidance our customers have come to expect from the regions bankers these changes will help us do so in a way that minimizes the associated health risks we are offering special financial assistance to support our customers who are experiencing financial hardships related to the pandemic through tuesday we have processed approximately consumer payment deferral request including approximately related to residential mortgages in addition weve processed requests for approximately mortgage loans serviced for others from a business customer perspective we processed approximately more also as the certified sba lender weve been working very hard to help customers through the new paycheck protection program and im proud to say that through yesterday we have facilitated assistance to our business customers totaling billion weve recognized the importance to our customers and their employees of access to fund through this program in the span of eight days we established a cross functional team to create an endtoend digital application built automation around every feasible point in the process reassigned several hundred staff from other departments regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 and train them to accept and process loan applications for small business owners were hopeful congress will appropriate additional funds as significant need remains importantly the bank also contained to lend the customers outside of the stimulus programs during the quarter new and renewed loan originations to business customers totaled just over billion further through the bank and our foundation weve committed approximately million toward consumer and small business recovery efforts we are also donating advertising time originally purchased for promoting bank products and services to food banks across our footprints these advertisements encourage viewers to finance and support food banks as they strive to help those in need as we navigate through this crisis our teams will continue to come together to identify innovative and meaningful ways to better connect with and serve our customers for some time now we have communicated our goal of generating consistent sustainable longterm performance through every economic cycle all of our plans are built around this concept because of our focus and the deliberate steps we have taken we entered these challenging times from a position of strength underpinned by robust capital and liquidity this will allow us to better support our customers as we work together to get through this unprecedented time in our history we will incur some stress thats just a result of the economy were in as we combat this public health crisis but unlike the crisis the financial services industry experienced a decade ago we are providing solutions to meet the needs of our customers during this extraordinary time weve spent decades strengthening our capital position and risk management framework through an intense focus on risk adjusted returns client selectivity and robust concentration risk management we have built a more balanced and diverse portfolio our strong capital and liquidity positions combined with extensive derisking efforts give us confidence that we can weather the pressure from the abrupt economic slowdown in addition two years ago we initiated a significant hedging strategy to reduce net interest income variability and protect us from the impacts of a lower interest rate environment the benefit from our hedging strategy provides us with a substantial competitive advantage in the current low rate environment all of this allows us to move forward confidently and remain focused on the things we can control providing support to our associates and communities and offering firstclass advice guidance and education to our customers although were in a time of significant economic stress its too soon to estimate its duration or severity we are encouraged by the actions taken by government and bank regulators to provide relief to individuals and small businesses while also supporting the smooth functioning of the financial markets in light of this uncertainty we are resending our financial targets for this year along with our three year targets previously announced in we remain committed to our strategic plan but acknowledge the need to remain flexible during this time of unprecedented and historic uncertainty we will provide updates with respect to our financial targets once conditions stabilize and we have better visibility we adopted the concept of shared values several years ago whereby what we do as a business must create longterm value for customers communities associates and shareholders frankly im convinced that it has never been more important as we work through the current health crisis together with our customers and communities thank you for your time and attention this morning with that i will now turn it over to david david j turner jr chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with our quarterly highlights regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 first quarter net income totaled million resulting in diluted earnings per share of items impacting our results this quarter includes a significant cecl provision in excess of net chargeoffs and a large increase to our cva associated with customer derivatives as interest rates moved down substantially during the quarter and credit spreads widened partially offsetting the negative adjustments our msr net of hedges performed favorably during the quarter in total the adjustment and additional selected items highlighted on the slide reduced our pre tax results by approximately million lets take a look at our results starting with the balance sheet adjusted average loans increased while adjusted ending loans increased loan growth was driven primarily by elevated commercial draws activity late in the quarter utilization rates increased from at the end of the year to at the end of march as a point of reference our utilization rate is typically around and during the global financial crisis peaked around in the last week of the quarter the pace of increase slowed and we expect utilization rates will remain relatively stable for the time being the draws we experienced have been primarily defensive or cautionary in nature and are broadbased geographically and across all industries approximately have come from investment grade companies so we anticipate a portion of these customers will eventually seek permanent financing through the capital markets however it is too early to try and predict timing of any refinancing as a result predicting loan growth is challenging however i do want to remind you that on april we closed our purchase of ascentium capital which included approximately billion in loans to small businesses we look forward to leveraging the technology speed and convenience that ascentium is known for in combination with our broad spectrum of banking solutions to meet the needs of small businesses during this difficult time lets turn to deposits average deposits increased while ending deposits increased as many of our corporate customers drawing on their lines are keeping that excess cash in their deposit accounts we expect these balances will come down over time as customers secure financing in the capital markets or customers get more clarity regarding the economic impact of the health crisis as we have experienced in previous periods of stress consumer deposits increased as customers seek the safety and soundness of a regulated and insured financial institution we expect total deposits will continue to increase both at regions and across the industry on an ending basis corporate segment deposits increased while wealth and consumer segment deposits each increased these increases were partially offset by decrease in the wholesale broker deposits within the other segment shifting to net interest income and margin which is a strong story for regions net interest income increased linked quarter and net interest margin increased basis points to as expected net interest income and net interest margin have been a source of stability under an extremely volatile market interest rate backdrop specifically lower loan yields were offset by lower funding cost and the benefit of forward starting hedges becoming active in the quarter now that most of our forward starting hedges have begun and given our ability to move deposit costs lower our balance sheet is largely insulated from movement in shortterm rates low hedges added million to net interest income and basis points to the margin in the quarter this will increase going forward as the benefits are realized for the entirety of future quarters further all of our hedges have five year tenures and a quarter end market valuation of billion another relative differentiator regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 of note net interest income was supported in march as libor rates remained elevated at a time when other shortterm rate indices which are a large driver of deposit cost moved close to zero the benefit of elevated libor is projected to normalize by midyear additionally higher average loan balances increased net interest income but reduced net interest margin while one fewer day in the quarter reduced net interest income but increased net interest margin total deposit cost declined basis points compared to the prior quarter to basis points and interest bearing deposit cost declined basis points to basis points regions continues to deliver industry leading performance in the space exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise over the coming quarters we expect deposit cost to migrate back down into the basis point to basis point range looking ahead to the second quarter let me start by saying these expectations exclude the potential impact from the feds paycheck protection program but are too uncertain to include in the forecast at this time we expect second quarter net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from the ascentium capital acquisition net interest margin is anticipated at roughly excluding ascentium a larger average balance sheet in the near term is anticipated given increased loan and liquidity needs from our customers while this will benefit net interest income it will slightly reduce net interest margin lets take a look at fee revenue and expenses almost all noninterest revenue categories were impacted by market volatility and economic uncertainty resulting in a decrease compared to the prior quarter after experiencing a record quarter in the fourth quarter capital markets revenue decreased to million excluding unfavorable cva capital markets income totaled million we generated record customer derivatives income in connection with lower interest rates but experienced decreases across all other categories looking forward ma transactions in particular are likely to remain on hold until markets stabilize and the economic outlook becomes more certain mortgage income increased over the fourth quarter driven primarily by elevated sales and record application volumes associated with the favorable rate environment as well as positive net hedge performance on mortgage servicing rights lower interest rates sparked a significant increase in yearoveryear production in fact our first quarter total application volume was more than double our historical first quarter average wealth management revenue remained stable despite market volatility if market conditions persist however we could experience a decline next quarter in line with lower asset values service charge revenue and card and atm fees decreased and respectively during the last two weeks of the quarter we observed a reduction of approximately in consumer spending activity looking forward if current spend levels persist we estimate total consumer noninterest income will be negatively impacted by approximately million to million per month from premarch levels partially offsetting these headwinds however are positive revisions to anticipated mortgage income resulting from lower interest rates mortgage production increased compared to the first quarter of the prior year and pipelines are strong fullyear production is expected to increase by approximately versus the prior year lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses remained well controlled decreasing compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by lower salaries and benefits professional fees and marketing expenses salaries and benefits decreased driven by lower production based incentives and negative market value adjustments on employee benefit assets which are offset by lower noninterest income regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 professional fees decreased driven primarily by elevated legal consulting and professional fees in the fourth quarter the companys first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was and the effective tax rate was we continue to benefit from continuous improvement processes as we have completed only of our current list of identified initiatives for example since the first quarter of last year we have reduced total corporate space by almost square feet or while still early the pandemic is already having an impact on how we interact and communicate with customers and each other weve already initiated changes and in many instances are discovering that not all change is bad for example we have wealth teams calling on and winning business using webex and videoconferencing in effective and dynamic ways whether its through new ways to interact with customers for increased use of hoteling we believe there are additional opportunities where corporate space is concerned so were going to keep our minds open as we navigate through this disruption so lets shift to asset quality we adopted the seasonal accounting standard as of january as permitted by the federal reserve we will defer the impact from the seasonal accounting standard on common equity tier capital each quarter until the end of after which you will be phased in at per year as of march this amount is approximately million and represents all of our dayone after tax adjustment recorded directly as a reduction of shareholders equity on january the as well as of our first quarter provision in excess of net chargeoffs the related impact to our first quarter common equity tier ratio is approximately basis points under cecl credit loss provision expense for the quarter totaled million this amount includes providing for million in net chargeoffs as well as million of additional provision reflecting adverse economic conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic forecast including uncertainty surrounding the benefits of government stimulus already enacted and potential additional stimulus all occurring since the initial assessment and adoption on january the additional provision was further impacted by higher specific reserves associated with downgrades primarily in the energy and restaurant portfolios the resulting allowance for credit losses is of total loans and of total nonaccrual loans chargeoffs were basis points this quarter and included the impact from our most recent shared national shared national credit exam nonperforming loans increased to million primarily driven by energy credits total delinquencies and troubled debt restructured loans decreased and respectively while business services criticized loans increased recently regulatory agencies issued guidance stating shortterm modifications to borrowers experiencing financial distress as a result of economic impacts created by covid19 will not be classified as a troubled debt restructured loan as long as their payments were current as of december we do not expect a material increase in tdrs in this environment we are monitoring all of our portfolios closely however i want to take a couple of minutes to highlight a few portfolios currently experiencing stress in most instances these are the same portfolios we have been discussing for some time now energy is a portfolio we continue to monitor direct energy balances totaled billion or of loans outstanding at quarter end since we have worked diligently to remix the portfolio and reduce our exposure to the oilfield services sector which is where most of our losses have occurred during the quarter we conducted an intensive review of all of our energy clients including eps midstream and oilfield services which resulted in a handful of downgrades in both the ep and midstream space we have been in the energy business for over years and have always maintained a heavy focus on client selectivity our spring borrowing base redeterminations are in process and we are continually reassessing our price deck regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 at current oil price levels we do expect additional stress but overall believe the portfolio will perform at least as well as it did in the crisis perhaps even better given the significant remixing in the portfolio within the hospitality portfolio which includes restaurant and hotels we are closely monitoring casual dining and quick serve total restaurant balances were billion at quarter end casual dining restaurants with balances of approximately million are continuing to experience stress due to higher labor costs oversupply digital transformation challenges and general pressure on margins we expect additional pressure in this space as shelterinplace orders continue in fact were already receiving requests for mitigation and payment deferrals quick serve which represents of our restaurant portfolio seems to be holding up well our exposure to hotels is primarily limited to a handful of large wellstructured reach which typically have lower leverage and strong cash positions depending on the ultimate duration of the pandemic we expect most will weather the downturn however we have already experienced several requests for relief were also closely watching the transportation retail and agriculture portfolios as they also have the potential to be adversely impacted by the current business environment i previously mentioned the approximately billion of small business loans we acquired as part of the ascentium capital acquisition on april 1st these balances will be reported with our second quarter results but let me briefly remind everyone that under cecl you will see a sizable adjustment currently estimated to be between million and million establishing our initial allowance for these loans which will run through provision expense this expense will be offset by accretion of the credit discount through interest income over the life of the purchase loan portfolio recent annual loss rates on this book of business have been approximately because they focus on business essential equipment and high fico guarantors we believe the business will be resilient through periods of stress recall the average yield on these loans are approximately and they do include certain prepayment protections so while losses will increase in the near term due to the economic environment we continue to feel very good about the acquisition and are looking forward to working together to better support our small business customers the extent to which all of our customers are ultimately impacted will be a factor of the duration and severity of the economic impact as well as the effectiveness of the various government programs in place to support individuals and businesses there is a lot that is still unknown however what we do know is that we enter this environment from a position of strength and are committed to assisting our customers and communities as john mentioned we know we will experience some stress however our strong capital and liquidity positions accompanied by a decade long journey to enhance our credit risk management framework and our disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk have made us better managers of risk and have positioned us well to weather an economic downturn so lets take a look at capital and liquidity during periods of stress liquidity management is critical like the rest of the industry we experienced a spike in credit line draws late in the quarter these were primarily from companies being prudent and wanting to ensure they had adequate cash on hand we did the same thing through additional advances at the federal home loan bank which we used to increase our cash at the federal reserve liquidity at regions really starts with our granular and stable deposit base which provides superior liquidity value regions has traditionally maintained one of the lowest loantodeposit ratios in our peer group at the quarter end regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 this ratio stood at and includes the impact of increased line of credit draws observed by customers late in the quarter further our risk management and stress testing framework ensure our liquidity positions are prepared to meet customer needs in turbulent times such as these beyond deposits regions also has ample sources of additional liquidity which can be readily used to meet customer needs our primary liquidity sources include cash balances held at the federal reserve borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank and unencumbered highly liquid securities these readily available sources totaled approximately billion at quarter end and when combined with another billion of availability at the federal reserves discount window total available liquidity stands at billion fhlb advances remain the primary tool we use to fulfill shortterm funding needs we have seen great interest in the sba paycheck protection program loans and we are endeavoring to meet the needs of customers while we will use liquidity resources on hand to meet those nearterm needs were also looking at the federal reserves new paycheck protection program ph lending facility as an alternative funding source with respect to parent company cash we also maintain a conservative position by policy parent company cash must always exceed months worth of debt service and dividend payments and current cash forecast remain above our management target of months lets turn to capital regions continues to maintain strong capital levels our common equity tier ratio is estimated at our quantitative target for this ratio is derived mathematically and as we have previously discussed is we believe this is the appropriate level of capital to withstand a severely adverse scenario and still remain above post stress limits weve also maintained approximately basis points as a strategic management buffer which could be deployed opportunistically we used a portion of the management buffer on the ascentium transaction which closed april as we go forward future economic performance and its impact on earnings will be the primary driver of nearterm capital levels in addition to the negative implications due to covid19 it is also important to keep in mind that we have never seen the volume at which fiscal stimulus and government lending programs have been implemented the ability of these programs to effectively work to help support the businesses and consumers within the economy will dramatically impact credit performance for us and the industry during this period of uncertainty we will continue to work with our customers to help them navigate these uncertain times additionally we will lean into our early warning and key performance indicators that we have built over the years which give us a granular view into the performance of our portfolios where we see indications that a customer will continue to face stress once the shortterm relief is over we will move those credits into more adversely rated categories and well continue to review their performance as you know we have a robust capital planning infrastructure and perform a range of stresses on credit performance within our portfolio whereas this environment is unlike anything we have ever seen our stress testing gives us confidence that we have the capital to withstand the stress during the quarter the company declared million in common dividends we had no share repurchases during the quarter and have announced plans to suspend share repurchases through the second quarter because we established our dividend to withstand adverse conditions we currently have no plans to reduce or eliminate our dividend however we will continue to exercise prudent capital management and monitor the business environment so in summary our robust capital and liquidity planning processes which are stressed internally as well as externally by our regulators are designed to ensure resilience and sustainability this gives us confidence that we regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 can continue to meet the needs of our customers and communities during this exceptional period of economic uncertainty as john mentioned considering the unprecedented environment we are facing we are rescinding our financial targets for this year as well as our threeyear targets previously announced in we have a good strategic plan and are committed to its continued execution when the economic outlook becomes more certain we will provide you with updated targets in the meantime we are focusing our attention on helping our associates customers and communities navigate through this difficult landscape which in turn benefits you our shareholders we believe strongly in the concept of shared value in order for us to thrive the communities we serve also need to thrive rest assured during this extraordinary time regions stands ready to help and support all of our stakeholders with that were happy to take your questions in light of the current environment we do ask that each of you ask only one question to allow for more participants we will now open the line for your questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions well pause for just a moment to compile the qa roster your first question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning hey good morning a couple so my one question is just regarding the decision to pull the mediumterm guidance i totally understand the but when i see that youre pulling the mediumterm guidance im wondering is that because of the concern you have around the depth of how tough could end up being or is there some other rationale for that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah betsy this is david i just think given the uncertainty thats in the environment right now which is prudent for us to just remove it all therell be an appropriate time for us to put back and give you our target longterm targets i mean youve known after a couple of ph investor days where we strive to get but it just didnt seem appropriate for us to have those at this time operator your next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning guys so i just a question on just all the moving parts around your nii forecast i understanding that theres the lower ppp theres the ascentium i guess with the persistence of your hedges do you still believe youve got that general sustainability past in terms of the ability to support dollars of nii as you look past these the adds as you get in from first or second how would you help us understand that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so going into the second quarter we said we pick up nii resulting from our ascentium acquisition ph i believe the hedge as you could see our we have chart in there as to when our hedges continue to more of them kick in latter part of this quarter and into the second quarter we only had million of benefit in the first quarter from our hedges you can see we also have billion of fair value which comes in over approximately five years so if we just did some straight lining you would see an approximate million benefit in each of the quarters and its not straight line but that just gives you a ballpark so with that we strongly believe in the support were going to get from our hedges we think thats a big differentiator for us clearly the margin will shift down a bit and then kind of stabilize there for the remainder of the year after the ascentium impact and you get the hedges rolling in the growth in nii really will be driven by the balance sheet and what happens from that standpoint ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks a lot david ill leave it up there given your one question request david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from brian foran of autonomous research brian foran q analyst autonomous research oh hi maybe a followup on the hedges you know its interesting ph i mean all the regional banks generally opted out including ph aoci in capital as to be seen as a form of regulatory release but now especially for a bank like you where youve got the ph outside team that you kind of understates your capital ratios in a way so i wonder can you just remind us what ph would the capital ratios look like if the unrealized gains were included and is there any scenario where the hedges are so valuable you would actually monetize that invest them some way in an acquisition or a buyback or is that just too far out there david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well so we made our decision to exclude oci it was a choice we had had we not made that choice we would have had just with the hedges that we have another billion thats pretax and capital but once you make the decision you have to live by it and thats okay so to the extent that we see opportunities to terminate those regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 swaps we would take that gain it would be deferred and amortized in the income therefore capital over the remaining life of the swaps which as i mentioned earlier are fiveyear tenors so that would only be in a case where you solve the probability of rates increasing and then wed get ahead of that that does not seem to be the case at this point in time but youre asking the right question there will come a point in time where we do that remember that the hedges are to protect net income from being degraded as a result of lowinterest rate environment its not an incremental its trying to protect what we do have and so while were enjoying that protection theres no need for us to try in frontend gains and use that for capital actions its to sustain our profile and our consistency of generating ppnr brian foran q analyst autonomous research thank you operator your next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you just talk about some of your expense levers that you can pull while a lot of things are shut down and theres obviously a lot of emphasis on employees but youve had kind of continuous improvement on expenses for several years and just talk about some of the things that you can look at in the environment here thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah matt so weve continued to be focused on expense management i think weve done a really good job there if you look at our top categories salaries and benefits occupancy and furniture fixtures and equipment the places weve been able to reduce expenses have been attached to our branches weve consolidated a whole lot more branches than weve opened up we continue to look at that and continue to have we have a whole group of people focused on our retail network strategy to make sure that were optimizing that network from a revenue and growth generation as well as cost optimization so you should expect us to continue there we have continued to reduce square footage were down some square feet in the quarter well be down another ph to square feet for the full year and were learning some things working from home and we really had missed a beat in terms of efficiency and effectiveness so i had mentioned in the prepared comments kind of hoteling and maybe theres an opportunity for us to continue to ramp that up even more so our vendors spend we continue to have programs in place to control and reduce vendor cost in particular on the demand management side of things so i think we have initiatives that weve identified in continuous improvement id mentioned we were through of those actually were through about of them well complete another this year so john has asked us to figure out how we get better at whatever we do wherever you are at the bank how do you do it better tomorrow than you did today and so i think you should regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 continue to see us look for ways to become more efficient and effective over time so we have some ways to continue to work on the expense side john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and i would just add matt weve seen a lot of change and improvement over the last four five weeks as weve accelerated the need to react the way we serve our customers and so i think it bodes well for continued process improvement with process improvement ph we can gain greater efficiency were absolutely committed to in fact were managing expenses all the time but particularly during this period of some great uncertainty matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question is from jennifer demba of suntrust john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning you mentioned energy and restaurant lending being particularly stressed what kind of loss content do you think you could see in these two buckets considering a range of possibilities of economic recovery john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp barb do you want to take that question barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp sure good morning jennifer you know as we look at the energy bucket as an example we know that right now that there is acute demand dislocation however on the other hand you also have opec which came out and reduced the supply by million barrels and then we combine that with the opening of the economy which were ph hoping will help should happen soon and thats going to help with demand and with some stabilization in prices id also point to this the book that we now have the fact that majority of it is now midstream and primary ep in the senior secured position no second lien positions et cetera that youre feeling pretty good about that book we actually stressed that jennifer down to a barrel we also know were in a contango market so we do anticipate higher future prices as well so we also know that crude storage is an issue so weve got our eyes on energy were managing again on a daytoday basis are we going to see some more energy losses probably but indiscernible our ep book weve only taken million of losses since for ep the one that we have this quarter we saw the loss numbers it was roughly million loss to an ep customer regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 indiscernible grouping but it was a master limited partnership so not truly ep per se and ph it was a shared national credit as well so we do see some of our nonperforming loans goal are going to increase and criticized and classified theyre going to increase but in terms of ph surgeoffs while we know indiscernible we think theyll be well under control let me talk to you a second on restaurant restaurant its often said that primarily for restaurants its going to be indiscernible quick serve and fast casual et cetera what we know is our quick serve is down to fast casual is down to right now ph of our restaurant outstandings are well secured and we know that the fullservice restaurants right now are experiencing the greatest impact so again saying that we know theres going to be indiscernible theyre going to be pretty well controlled indiscernible john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you barb indiscernible operator your next question comes from peter winter of wedbush john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning good morning can you just talk about some of your economic assumptions what youre assuming and im just curious if you cut it off on march because weve just seen the recent economic forecasts have gone a little bit worse david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so peter given the significant economic volatility associated with covid19 we ran several economic scenarios to determine our allowance for credit losses we also used thirdparty comparisons in particular moodys march comparison our models really werent built for this type of change so we knew we are going to have to have some overlays on top of that to get to what we thought was an appropriate allowance for credit losses there has been a lot of discussion in terms of what we think about the recovery and what shape it is and really we think a better question would be not the shape of the curve but at what pace does it actually recover to prerecession levels and well call prerecession being the fourth quarter of so we have pretty severe numbers of gdp approaching that in the second quarter unemployment approaching the and while it does we do expect it to recover we expect that its going to be very slow if you go back to the financial crisis it took about quarters before we got back to prerecession gdp our expectation is its going to be somewhere between and quarters before we get back there so call it the latter part of so we do not think this snaps back we think its prolonged we get better from the second quarter right so you start to come up but youre just not going to come up at the pace that you just went down regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 therefore it cant be a v its going to be i dont know what the symbol is but to call the check mark more so and the slope of that will be the recovery again getting back to gdp in the fourth quarter at peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thank you operator your next question is from erika najarian of bank of america john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning my question is for barb if i could so the last time regions went through dfast the nine quarter loss rate was under severely adverse versus the fed runs has at and i can see the historical bias in the cre bucket but im wondering barb if you could give us a sense of what the difference is particularly in where they think your ci loss rate would be in such a scenario versus yours its a pretty wide gap there and in the most impacted industries that you outlined for us is a cumulative loss rate over two years of around to like we saw in the gfc fair or do you think theres just strong enough underwriting that would preclude that scenario from unfolding barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp well we always know firstly jennifer sic erika that were always going to have increased losses during these times of stress so ill start with that and we also know and i feel really comfortable on this thing that is the fact that our underwriting has changed our risk management is really strong the entire company is focused on overall risk management so we are going to perform better than in entire period if we look at what our dfast losses were ill just use maybe as a bellwether and somebody had used that in one of their analysis and at the time they said the that or turning off im sorry my allowance is billion and the dfast losses at the time were billion so thats roughly in a severe adverse environment of that and i think thats pretty good i think its going to range somewhere between the high and somewhere into the so again generally feeling comfortable with those numbers did i answer your question erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yeah i guess just wanted to clarify what you think the primary differences are in terms of what the fed sees in your portfolio in terms of the worse loss experience and also trying to figure out the upper bound of cumulative losses in those most impacted sectors that you outlined in your presentation barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah i think the biggest difference between what we look at and what the fed looks at so even though we take history into account the fed models are much more heavily biased towards history which is the reason i started regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 with we are a change company were not going back to outlook areas those periods but those were our highest loss histories which are currently filling the models in the fed model as you know they dont disclose how they arrive at their models so we have to make some assumptions and we know that theres still a fairly heavy weighting on that whereas we have probably less of a weighting on that especially given all of our performance since then has been much better john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp erica id just add this is john weve spent a lot of time i think as you know focused on client selectivity on risk adjusted returns on balance and diversity on derisking if you look across our portfolios we dont have any meaningful concentrations in my view anyway in any particular asset classes we have a rigorous capital planning and stress testing process we are applying stresses against our portfolio and making observations about it based upon what we know today the provision and the reserves that were currently provision we experienced the reserves were currently holding reflect our expectation of losses given what we know if the economic environment that exists currently persists then it is very possible that we could see some additional provisioning but we do believe our loss experience will be much better as to why our own projections are different from the fed were always trying to figure that out and we still have i think work to do to better understand weve been advocating and the fed is responding to giving us more transparency into their assumptions and their work because we think thatll be helpful if theres a real difference between what they believe and what we believe we need to understand what that is so that we can react to it and so just purely from a standpoint of regulatory relationships it is something that we continue to advocate for erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator your next question is from saul martinez of ubs john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys hey good morning i just have a very specific question on ascentium so youre taking your cecl through a bond on that loan or im sorry on the loan book what was the credit mark on that and by extension how much of an incremental purchase accounting accretion benefit are you going to get on that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so our day one we are still working through that weve given you a range of this adjustment in the million to million range that will be utilized or setup as to be amortized to margin over the life of the loan and well thats our best estimate for that adjustment at this time regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp just to kind of frame it up as to where that number comes from so the losses in that portfolio have been about and the duration of saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp that book is under call it years and so we will have something in the times to times at number that will be recorded in the allowance for the offset and then becoming part of the purchase accounting accretion over time saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay sorry just getting in the beliefs in the accounting but my understanding is theres essentially a double hit david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thats right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc definitely with this and you got the so youll have a similar sized credit mark and then over the and years you would amortize youd have that come back to is purchase accounting accretion and theoretically that should all flow to the bottom line given indiscernible forward david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thats correct saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 operator your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning question on the credit side based upon that we got new moodys data that come out after the quarter close does that point to a likelihood of an additional reserve build in the second quarter and then separately could you give us a little bit of detail what type of loan loss reserve you have against some of those higher risk portfolios that you mentioned on those slides in the back of the deck thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yes so from a second quarter standpoint we did the best we could coming up with what we believe to be an appropriate cecl provision for the life of the loan at march 31st taking in all available evidence clearly as john just mentioned if things persist at this level and the stimulus doesnt work or didnt work to the degree were saying there is a risk that we provide over chargeoffs in subsequent quarters the question is we just need to wait and see what it looks like at the end of june we cant every day is a new day this is a very volatile environment so things continue to trend worse at this point in time but we also have trillion of stimulus going into the system which compares to about trillion in the last crisis and that would remind everybody that trillion came overtime this trillion has come pretty quickly and now the government is continuing to look at additional ways to provide stimulus so what does it all mean its just hard to estimate so we cant conclude right now that we would have an adjustment over chargeoffs but thats reasonably possible given if things trend like this thats a likely event what was the second part of your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp the question was john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah just the size of the reserve that you have against some of the higher risk portfolios that youve flagged including leverage lending david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i dont have that granularity in front of me on those particular portfolios yet we are going to have some incremental disclosure in our 10q of the major components so business services consumer then within that the breakout for mortgage credit card indirect auto and so forth but i dont have that john at that we can get that to you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 yeah we are just indiscernible business versus consumer were holding basis points reserves against the business portfolio basis points against consumer to gets you back to the basis points john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you operator your next question is from dave rochester of compass point john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david rochester q managing director assistant director of research compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys appreciate all the color on the energy in the restaurant books just maybe digging a little bit deeper i was just wondering how far along you are in that borrowing base redetermination process at this point if you have a sense for where the new deck is how much lines have contracted for those customers and then just on the restaurant book if youve been able to do a full review of that book as well and if you have a sense for how many customers may no longer be operating at this point and just how you project indiscernible should be for that if you assume some of those guys come back into business thanks john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah barb you want to respond to that question barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah for the energy book we are roughly a quarter of the way through the borrowing base redetermination for the season so far weve seen that for borrowing bases the indiscernible down about so we know that theres clearly some impact there we should be through the rest of our books in the course of the next month monthandahalf so we can always give more color at that point in time on the restaurant book weve also looked at each client individually because there arent that many clients and so we are talking to them on a regular basis daily weekly monthly right now make sure we have our handle on that we do see some continued pressure on full service in particular as i said quick service is a lot better but the full service portfolio which has got as i said the most impact is really because the restaurants are closed so until the economy opens up were going to continue to see some pressure there and were going to continue to see some losses there albeit we believe theyre very manageable and containable david rochester q managing director assistant director of research compass point research trading llc so what portion of that book would be closed right now and then do you just assume they come back later on in your reserving process regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah i dont have the exact number that are closed at this minute but in the restaurant book we have customers in total and of that it would be somewhere a portion of that obviously and in terms of close its hard to count do i count each individual shop in terms of someone whos got multiple units and theyve only closed one or two et cetera so that becomes a little bit of a tricky answer to that question but yes there are a handful probably in the nature of to right now john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah the only thing i would add just sort of points you to our slide number on page i think as barb says the bulk of the casual dining portfolio represented by about customers is just over billion in exposure of that portfolio is currently criticized and that reflects our view of the risk in that portfolio today based upon what we know david rochester q managing director assistant director of research compass point research trading llc yeah all right great thanks guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator your next question is from stephen scouten of piper sandler john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey wanted to dig down a little deeper maybe into some of the impacts from some of the government programs and i know its kind of hard to say but in regulatory release and maybe specifically on the payment deferrals if you have a percentage amount of your loans that are in deferral currently and how you think those pan out maybe days down the line if those do become tdrs down the line and then with the main street lending program in particular how might that impact your syndicated loan book and those peoples ability to kind of borrow additional fund if they dont refinance yet regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp so maybe ill work backwards i think theres a lot of interest in the main street lending program we have a team working on better understanding the guidelines and how it will apply i dont know that we have a real good feel yet for how many customers will awfully be interested and how that might affect our customer base but clearly one of a number of programs that the government andor congress have made available to customers that will be helpful over time i cant remember the first part of your question now david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp payment deferrals john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp oh payment deferrals so with our business customers and weve now granted about deferrals to small businesses about to middle market customers so our approach there is to treat those customers on a casebycase basis to evaluate the ongoing indiscernible of their business and if prior to the pandemic starting they had a viable business and were doing well were a good customer then well typically grant them a deferral and in some instances that might be for up to six months generally theyre day deferrals interest only typically and then we revisit those at the end of that period but that is specific to customers who were in good standing prior to the pandemic beginning and they clearly appear to have what we believe to be a viable business after the pandemic whenever that is on the consumer side were generally offering deferrals for days to customers at the end of that day period well think as i mentioned weve granted deferrals in our own balance sheet mortgage book another deferrals for the mortgage portfolio that we service for others and about deferrals of other consumer credit whether it be credit cards installment loans home equity lines et cetera which is roughly a little less on the mortgage portfolio a little less than million and thats a billion portfolio i think i got the number right so that gives you some perspective barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah and this is barb just to give you some percentages based on what john said on the mortgage portfolio for our own book its about of our accounts have been deferred on the commercial corporate book at and the consumer book is just given the large number of consumers john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and i think on our mortgage book barb half of the loans that have been deferred the loan to value is less than barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp that is correct regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for the color guys appreciate it john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hope thats helpful operator your next question is from bill carcache of nomura john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning bill carcache q analyst nomura securities hi good morning my main question is on how much you think the payment protection program will really benefit credit performance on the consumer side of your business im curious because employees who are participating in ppp are getting those benefits in lieu of what would otherwise be unemployment insurance which suggests i think that ppp may be understating the level of initial claims i was curious to hear your thoughts on that and since we know historically high level of initial claims are associated with elevated consumer credit losses i just wondered whether you had any perspective on whether the payment behavior of employees participating in ppp help you guys minimize credit losses on the consumer side of your business john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah its completely anecdotal as i talked to customers some have furloughed employees that they intend to bring back if they get funding out of the ppp program and so those employees likely went and applied for unemployment but may get an opportunity to come back at some point and so you have that subset versus the group that have been maintaining their workforce on an ongoing basis and are hopeful to get ppp funding in order to continue to employ those teams as you know the funding is typically for about an eightweek period and so i think as we look at the program we think it is very helpful in the short run theres a tremendous amount of interest in the program way more interest in need for funding that has been appropriated todate were very hopeful that congress will appropriate some more money to help small business i would say that in the short run i do think that it will have a positive impact both on consumers small businesses and as a result the corresponding credit that we have but i dont think its a solution three or four months from now if theyre not indiscernible other funding that comes behind it in some way shape or form regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 bill carcache q analyst nomura securities thats super helpful thank you operator your final question comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning christopher marinac q director of research janney montgomery scott llc thanks hey just wanted to ask about the cecl forecast period if barb could walk us through that does that work against you with the new numbers on unemployment or was that already factored at the end of march barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah for cecl we did the nine quarter losses we have a two year reversing period so we looked at nine quarters as compared to ccar which was nine quarters so its not a lot of different and really what we did and i can quickly talk about that as we look at several different internally developed economic forecasts that we did as well as industry stress level analysis where ive included moodys critical pandemic that came out recently and then both of those looking at those gave us a range of potential losses due to whats going to happen in covid and then we took those outlook which included again both acute economic stress in the immediate term as well as in the general recession type outlook and our analysis reflected the key economic variables to our models for our base forecast as well as an abrupt recession and typical recession et cetera so again a lot of different inputs to help inform us for a potential range of future chargeoffs and then we performed specific stresses on sectors we believe would be most impacted so as an example when these are included but not limited to energy restaurants hotels manufacturing retail trade and again came up with what we felt was our best number this was the million over chargeoff by the way this is the process i just walked through that we rely on when were doing our ccar and doing our capital planning which is why we feel good about the process given weve been doing capital planning now for years and years and have a very strong very solid profit there and again it incorporates what were seeing here coming out of cecl coming out of whats happening with the covid environment christopher marinac q director of research janney montgomery scott llc great thank you barb and thank you john john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you okay thats the last question we have well thank you all for your
