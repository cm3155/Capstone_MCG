billion or to over billion putting aside ppp activities loans were up billion or our highest organic growth rate in well over a decade with contributions from most businesses following growth of almost billion in driven by government stimulus deposits decreased billion in as customers utilize excess cash and we executed strategic pricing actions revenue increased driven by higher interest rate and strong loan growth noninterest expenses reflected from strategic investments higher compensation in conjunction with favorable performance and modernization initiatives totaling million credit metrics were excellent as driven by net chargeoffs of only basis points and problem assets remain well below our historical norm in summary a strong performance with an roe of and an roa of in the fourth quarter we generated earnings of million or per share as outlined on slide our financial results were excellent with alltime high revenue of over billion up over the third quarter average loans grew almost billion which includes a million decrease in mortgage banker where volume had been impacted by higher rates comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 average deposits declined billion however balance has stabilized at quarter end and we began to see some positive trends credit quality was exceptional with net recoveries and our percentage of criticized loans remains well below our historical average we built reserves in conjunction with growth and a slightly more negative economic outlook expenses reflected investments in our business and support our revenuegenerating activities it was a record quarter and a record year we are excited about the investments we are making to not only support our colleagues and customers but also to sustain our strong performance as we move forward and ill now turn the call over to jim who will review the quarter in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide broadbased loan growth continued and exceeded expectations with the average balances increasing billion or commitments which can be a good indicator of future loan growth increased with contributions from most businesses utilization remained stable at and remained below historical averages as commitment growth outperformed the increase in borrowings loans in our commercial real estate business increased nearly million as the pace of payoffs slowed and we fund the construction projects already in the pipeline consistent with our selected strategy nearly all of the growth was in class a multifamily or industrial projects built by large developers that we know well providing significant equity contributions typically averaging between and of costs credit quality in this portfolio continues to be excellent criticized loans remain extremely low and we see no meaningful signs of negative migration with our bankers that average years of experience a proven operational process stringent underwriting and consistent credit monitoring we believe our approach results in a conservative portfolio appropriately positioned to navigate the current environment national dealer services loans grew over million as a result of new relationships and continued ma activity by our customers we continue to see a slow rebound in inventory levels and with consumer auto demand dampening and supply chain improving the industry anticipates inventory levels to continue increasing throughout corporate banking wealth management and entertainment also contributed significantly to our strong loan growth elevated interest rates lack of housing inventory and normal seasonality continue to pressure mortgage banker as average loans declined million for the quarter mba forecast showed volumes remaining at depressed levels through the first quarter before potentially increasing loan yields increased basis points to primarily reflecting the benefit from higher rates on slide average deposits declined as customers continued to utilize funds in their business and seek higher yield however balances ended the quarter better than we expected as we adjusted pricing in conjunction with aggressive fed rate hikes the strategy worked as periodend interestbearing deposits increased to billion while we did see a modest uptick in noninterestbearing deposits late in the year we attribute it largely to traditional seasonality with elevated business activities such as customers preparing to make tax payments and distributions in the first quarter we continue to believe future fomc monetary actions are key to the timing of deposit stabilization comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 our overall mix remained favorable with of average noninterestbearing deposits largely in operational accounts reflecting our commercial orientation our liquidity position was strong with the loantodeposit ratio of below our historical average beyond deposits we have significant capacity to support loan growth including repayments in our securities portfolio and efficient borrowing channels such as broker deposits and federal home loan bank lines interestbearing deposit costs averaged basis points and reflected the pricing actions taken in the fourth quarter our dynamic pricing strategy will continue to balance our funding needs with customers objectives and the rate environment average balances in our securities portfolio on slide declined billion primarily reflecting the fullquarter effect in the third quarters marktomarket adjustments in addition we are not reinvesting paydowns and are instead repurposing those funds for loan growth relatively stable longterm rates resulted in a positive markto market adjustment of million at periodend our total net unrealized pretax loss of billion affects our book value but not our regulatory capital ratios while we maintain the portfolio as available for sale mostly for liquidity purposes we typically hold these securities to maturity in which case the unrealized losses should not impact income despite a reduction in the overall portfolio size securities income remained relatively stable due to higheryielding mbs purchases in the third quarter replacing the paydown of lower yielding securities turn to slide net interest income increased million to a record million and the net interest margin increased basis points the benefit from higher rates lifted loan income million and added basis points to the margin loan growth added million and basis points other portfolio dynamics added million or basis point and while the market remains competitive we have successfully maintained our pricing discipline as i mentioned securities income was relatively stable as far as deposits at the fed higher rates partly offset by lower balances added million and basis points to the margin adjustments to deposit pricing reduced income by million while lower balances added basis point higher rates on our floating rate wholesale debt in addition to our august subordinated debt offering had a billion impact altogether the rise in rates provided a net benefit of million in net interest income credit quality remained excellent as outlined on slide with million in net recoveries along with a reduction in our already low criticized and nonaccrual loans in fact inflows to nonaccrual loans were only million one of the lowest levels in recent history loan growth and the weakening economic forecast drove the provision expense up to million and the allowance for credit losses increased modestly to with our consistent disciplined approach as well as our relationship model and diverse customer base we believe we were well positioned to manage through a recessionary environment noninterest income on slide was robust at million and was impacted by volatility in the rate environment and equity markets deferred comp which is offset in expenses increased million generating a million return for the quarter higher rates earned on funds associated with settling our internal derivative portfolio drove risk management income of million the quarterly variance in the visa class b total return swap along with the increase in card and brokerage all contributed positively to the quarter as expected customer derivative volumes slowed from recent strong activity and there was a million favorable cva adjustment which is a million reduction from the third quarter deposit service charges reflected positive momentum in treasury management but they were more than offset comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 by higher earnings credit and lower fees associated with deposit balances fiduciary income was negatively impacted by fees related to equity returns and boli had a seasonal decline of million despite this quarters fluctuations we have a solid core product set delivering a strong level of noncapitalconsuming fee income with promising growth potential turning to expenses on slide we made significant progress towards our modernization objectives consolidating banking centers enhancing corporate facilities and achieving an important milestone in migrating our technology in all we incurred million in expenses for the quarter which is below the estimate we previously provided due to betterthanexpected severance and asset writedowns excluding modernization and deferred compensation which is fully offset noninterest expenses increased million in support of our growth initiatives we successfully attracted talent and continue to invest in products further elevating our customer experience increases in te legal and marketing were correlated with the strong business activity in the fourth quarter and driving future revenue with initiatives such as retail reimagined foundational investments in our infrastructure enhance controls and compliance in this evolving landscape as well as making us more nimble with regards to technology development we have some inflationary pressures including salaries for new staff and recent merit increases and saw seasonal increases in occupancy marketing and other related expenses overall we successfully balanced investments and other pressures with accelerated revenue growth resulting in a solid efficiency ratio of slide provides details on capital management with record earnings our strong capital generation outpaced capital needed for loan growth increasing our cet1 ratio to an estimated as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders we closely monitor loan growth profitability and credit trends as we balance maintaining our cet1 target of approximately with our dividend and share repurchase strategy our common equity increased benefiting from strong profitability and the impact from oci losses was minor excluding the aoci losses our common equity per share increased over also note that our tangible common equity ratio was however excluding aoci it increased to our outlook for is on slide and assumes no significant change in economic environment we expect low momentum to continue and produce another year of strong growth across all of our business lines resulting in average loans increasing to the pace of growth should be relatively consistent at to each quarter we expect average deposits to decline to as customers continue deploying operational deposits or seek higher yielding options we anticipate a seasonal decline in the first quarter followed by a partial rebound and then stabilization as we move through the year comparing fourth quarter yearoveryear deposits are projected to be down only to as previously mentioned we continue to believe the timing and scale of deposit activity will be influenced by a fomc monetary policy and economic activity with this uncertainty forecasting deposit levels is very challenging as we look at mix we project interestbearing growth driven by strategic pricing actions by yearend we expect to be closer to our historical deposit mix still very favorable as far as pricing we expect the first quarter to reflect the full quarter impact from rate actions we took in the fourth quarter and after that rate adjustment should be more modest as we continue to focus on customer relationships competitive dynamics and our funding needs we project strong net interest income up to over our record level which reflects the fullyear benefit from higher rates and we are assuming rates follow the forward curve first quarter will be impacted by two fewer days seasonal deposit outflows and continued deposit pricing actions we expect net interest comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 income to increase through the year as we continue to benefit from rising rates and loan growth in conjunction with expanding relationships and acquiring new customers credit quality has been excellent and we expect it to remain strong therefore we forecast net chargeoffs at the lower end of our normal range of basis points to basis points assuming the economy performs in line with our expectations we expect a gradual normalization in credit metrics and our reserve level we expect non interest income to grow customerrelated income is projected to increase particularly in card due to our payment strategy and fiduciary income which benefits from investments on our wealth management platform also we forecast an increase in risk management income related to our internal hedging position note this income will vary over time as rates move deferred comp was an million ph upgrade in which we assume will not repeat on the other hand elevated volumes of customer derivatives that we saw in are not expected to continue however we believe they have stabilized at a strong level and are poised to grow over time a reduction in our deposit service charges is expected due to an increase in commercial account eca rates and adjustments to our retail nsf fees we also assume boli returns to a historical run rate of approximately million to million a quarter and the million cva benefit does not repeat first quarter is expected to be impacted by seasonality and syndication fees and we assume deferred comp of million in the fourth quarter will not repeat the second half of the year is expected to be stronger than the first as loan syndication activity card fees derivatives and other products trend up our expenses are expected to grow or on an adjusted basis excluding the million increase in pension a million reduction in modernization charges and assuming the million in deferred comp benefit does not repeat drivers of the include the annual merit increase and other inflationary pressures as well as additional growth in cost tied to revenuegenerating activity such as higher staff levels and outside processing related to card further we estimate a million increase in fdic expenses and higher software costs we expect these headwinds to be partly offset by resetting performance comps to normal levels first quarter expenses are expected to be lower with the decline in performance comp seasonal declines in advertising and staff insurance as well as other items that are expected to decline from an elevated fourth quarter level such as modernization expenses deferred comp and legal costs annual stock compensation is expected to partly offset these reductions remaining modernization expenses are expected to be weighted more towards the second half of we remain committed to prudent expense management including investments we are making to increase revenue and enhance efficiency evidenced by an efficiency ratio forecasted below for in summary we drove robust loan growth and fee generation in in addition we benefited from higher rates while executing our hedging strategy and manage deposits credit and expenses we generated record revenue and eps reduced our efficiency ratio and delivered strong returns our fourth quarter has positioned us well for a strong now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim while leveraging our more predictable earnings stream we are better able

operator instructions your first question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc manan good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i was just wondering for can you help us with how you expect your funding mix to evolve through the year and as you mentioned its difficult to forecast deposit growth given the fed actions and the overall environment so if you could help us with any updated thoughts where you might be okay with your loantodeposit ratio going and how much flexibility you have there thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc good morning manan its jim i will answer that question starting with the funding mix its really important to us to stay diversified so were using a variety of efficient funding mechanisms while keeping some dry powder for future loan growth and so when we look at what we plan to do in first and foremost we are funding much the loan growth and to the extent we have deposit runoff were funding that with securities that we are allowing comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 to mature that includes both mbs securities that matured in somewhat predictable rate as well as some lumpy treasury maturities that we have beyond that we are getting a little bit more competitive with our deposit pricing both in terms of retaining deposits and attracting deposits that might not be currently on our balance sheet and then beyond that we do have efficient lines to the fhlb which we plan on using to some extent we do plan on adding some broker deposits not a lot but we will add a modest amount likely at some point here in the year and so we will use a variety of sources we will keep a lot of dry powder on the sidelines to make sure that we can fund ourselves very efficiently going forward in terms of loan to deposit ratio it is currently well below historical levels at we expect it to continue to be below historical levels as we look out in the future certainly for so no concerns from that standpoint and we feel really solid in terms of our ability to fund this loan growth and fund any deposits that might run off manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats really helpful so for the securities paydowns i know you mentioned is about billion a little bit over billion for next quarter can you help us with how that evolves through the year are there any other indiscernible maturities coming through in the second half james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah we would expect the mbs securities to continue to mature at a rate of about million a quarter we do have a million of treasuries that mature in the first quarter and then we have another million in the second quarter of this year and then we have a very small tranche i believe in december that wont be a big factor for but we should get somewhat of a boost from those maturing securities as they occur through the year manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator operator instructions next well go to the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning i want to start so the guidance implies nim expansion ph on top again for the first quarter and we know its a very fluid situation but from a big picture view as we sit here today how do you guys see the nim trending beyond the first quarter james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc good morning steve its jim as you know we typically dont like to focus on nim just because of our business model and it does tend to be a little bit more lumpy than other banks we like to focus on net interest income but to answer your question we do expect nim to be relatively stable in the range that it was in the fourth quarter it may tick up by a few bps as we see securities run off with those loweryielding securities but i think where were at right now in the fourth quarter is kind of the area that we will likely hover in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and jim whats the deposit beta youre assuming in this guidance by yearend james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah deposit beta is moving as well as of course the overall rate environment we were about at beta in the fourth quarter rates did continue to move to the fourth quarter so i would say we were approaching beta by the time you got to the month of december we do think in the first quarter we will start moving and eventually reach about a beta and for the full quarter average in the first quarter i do think it will be in that low to mid pushing up to and then as we move through the second quarter i do have us moving into the upper that does include going after some higherpriced deposits to make sure that we can fund our loan growth in an efficient way and then once we get through the second quarter as we hover in that upper if we had some broker deposits it could push towards about i would then expect it to kind of hold there and thats about the time that rates peak also so thats kind of the trajectory were assuming and that i see for deposit betas steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats very helpful and then maybe for my final question just diving a bit deeper into the decline in non interest bearing you guys are citing customers investing in their business but im curious how much is your customers chasing higher rate alternatives and along those lines up until this quarter what we had heard from many of the regional banks was that treasuries were the key competitors but whats coming up this quarter is that the regional banks themselves are really stepping up competition for deposits so how much are your customers chasing and can you talk about the competitive environment right now particularly from peer regionals thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i mean if i understood the question you were dipping a little bit out in terms of volume there but our customers when they do look at the higher yielding options they are looking at offbalance sheet money market comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 funds and we are increasingly becoming competitive to make sure we can compete from that standpoint and we think thats an efficient way to go its certainly better than wholesale borrowings for us in terms of where the leakage is occurring we do some surge deposits still in the dda and as we talk to customers and look at whats happening in the flows it does seem like probably of them to the extent of the deposits that have gone off the balance sheet are due to rate and then the remainder is kind of due to funding capex operations and maybe a variety of other things so certainly a mixture we do think to the extent customers are using deposits to fund their operations we view that as a very positive sign it is consistent with the loan story when you look at the strong loan growth that weve seen and weve forecasted but we are increasingly becoming competitive with money market funds where we feel we need to steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for all the color curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steve james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning just kind of a followup there jim are you seeing any cresting in deposit pricing pressures is it decelerating at all james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc i wouldnt say its decelerating i wouldnt say its accelerating either it kind of feels like it hit a certain pace in november and december and the more price sensitive customers have already asked to be repriced so from that standpoint you could see the pressure start to step back a little bit and some of these things some of comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 these are discussions that go on for several weeks so its really hard to pinpoint exactly what its cresting but its certainly not accelerating but i do see that momentum continuing probably through the first quarter in terms of exception pricing in terms of what we need to do with standard pricing it does feel like that maybe is abating a little bit but there are always those exception customers that are out there and i dont expect those to take a big step back over the next quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc and well likely get more competitive intentionally in terms of just going after customers that perhaps have moved their balances off balance sheet over the course of the last nine months jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and i know you just said you dont like to talk about the nim but ill ask you about that anyway youre up basis points yearoveryear and youre talking about stability what kind of threats do you see to that nim level i know youve done a lot of hedging but do you feel like thats a sustainable nim level in kind of varying up and down rate environments james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc i think the key to that is going to be dda that is really the wildcard and it really has the ability to move net interest income a lot you think about just billion of dda movement could create a million drag in this forward curve environment so that is going to be the wildcard so we think we can hover kind of in the upper call it the low to upper or im sorry mid to upper but more weighted towards the upper but i do think that dda is going to be the key to that assumption and that outcome jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then just one quick one to melinda expected reserve build how would you like us to think about that it seems like credit is very clean and obviously youre talking about the lower end of chargeoffs so how do you want us to think about the reserve build melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah jon good morning i would say that consistent with what we said last time that if the economic forecast stays relatively stable youre going to see continued loan or reserve build thats really consistent with our loan growth so the reserve right now we feel is conservatively positioned we feel really good about it and assuming no material deterioration in the economic forecast i think that reserve build will approximate what we have going on from a balance sheet growth perspective and the current assumptions on the reserve build is for our comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 baseline is mild recession so i think weve adequately factored in what the current economic forecast is looks like jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thats helpful thank you very much operator and at this time there are no further questions i would now like to turn the conference back to curt farmer president chairman and chief executive officer curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc let me again say that im very very proud of our record quarter thank you to all my colleagues for all they do
