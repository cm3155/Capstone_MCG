management discussion section mark edward tucker nonexecutive group chairman hsbc holdings plc good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us this morning before we get into the details of the presentation that noel and ewen will make i wanted to just set aside a few minutes just to give you some context during the course of the last year the board determined that it had two major priorities one was to ensure that a new group chief executive was selected and the other was the need to enhance performance accelerate pace and improve our sustainable returns collectively we concluded that both were urgent challenges and that we needed to tackle them immediately and separately we have always seen that these have needed to be parallel processes with independent timescales and the board i can promise you have been fully engaged in both let me deal first with the group ceo selection process the board has embarked on a very thorough and rigorous process to search for and identify a new ceo that process is well underway and its the boards intention to announce the outcome within the to 12month timescale that we outlined in august turning now to the business update we saw a pressing need to reallocate capital away from underperforming businesses to support the growth of higher return businesses particularly where we have competitive advantage the board and executive are also acutely aware of the need to improve efficiency reduce costs and inject pace hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 and we have been working hard on this and it is to noels credit that he has graphed the issues and tackled the task with energy and resolve he and the rest of the executive team have worked very closely with the board to formulate and determine the plans that they have announced today and as youve seen they amount to a very significant shift in the allocation of the banks capital and resources they build on a natural and inherent strengths of the organization and are designed to significantly improve sustainable return for our shareholders and then finally and is i think just worth mentioning important to mention and to recognize the continuing exceptional work of our team of our staff across the world particularly those in mainland china and hong kong who are dealing with the impacts of covid19 on both our customers and the bank the board and i want to make it clear that we owe them enormous gratitude and thanks for their continuing dedication their care and their immense professionalism having said all of that let me now pass over to noel and ewen to take you through the details noel quinn chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you mark and good morning to everyone in london and good afternoon to everyone listening or watching in hong kong we have two objectives today the first is to take you through our q4 and full year results for and the second is to tell you how were going to address the underperforming parts of the business and simplify the group to increase returns reduce our cost base and create capacity to invest in growth and technology were going to do this in three parts first ewen will take you through the numbers for ill then talk about our plan and then back to ewen to cover the financial implications of that plan and then well take questions so ill now pass straight over ewen for him to talk about our results ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all on the fourth quarter it was a decent set of results adjusted revenues were up reflecting both a weaker quarter in but also the continuing strength of our stronger performing franchises while adjusted profits were up due to the goodwill impairment of billion we made a reported loss before tax of billion as i go on to shortly hong kong continues to produce very resilient results in the fourth quarter with adjusted profits up relative to a year before but given the continuing impact of coronavirus that were seeing this year we do expect a weaker first half a few particular points to call out the headline results for the fourth quarter were impacted at a headline basis because of the large goodwill impairment this reflected the weakened interest rate outlook and revenue outlook and a changed longterm growth rate assumptions as you know the goodwill impairment has no impact on core tier the uk ringfenced bank was audio gap redress costs million in the fourth quarter driven mainly by sharply higher expected litigation costs in relation to ppi were making progress on reducing our cost run rate down by half from to just under in and second half costs were lower than first half costs our core tier was up basis points to weve reduced net riskweighted assets in the quarter by billion including a 19billion reduction in global banking and markets hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 on slide group continues to be underpinned by a strong set of franchises all showing continued attractive growth rates in retail banking and wealth management full year adjusted revenues were up with good growth in deposits mortgage balances and customer numbers the turnaround of global private banking continues with net new money of billion in the year commercial banking revenues were up underpinned by strong growth in both lending and deposits and for our global transaction banking franchise revenues were up and thats despite the impact of a softer interest rate environment in asia revenues up overall with good growth across most of the region and the uk ringfenced bank had revenue growth of underpinned by deposit balance and mortgage growth turning to the next slide and to go into more detail on hong kong macro conditions progressively became more challenging in the second half and remain challenging given the sharp and unfolding impact of the coronavirus despite these macro conditions last year performance remained resilient adjusted revenue growth was credit quality remaining robust and profits before tax of billion on slide if we set over recent quarters weve also got businesses or parts of businesses that need to improve our nonringfenced bank is impacted by a combination of high costs and challenging conditions for the sector overall revenues were down in the full year and as part of those global banking and markets had a weak year in europe with sharply lower revenues driving an reduction in pretax profits our us turnaround has been impacted by the changed us outlook for interest rates full year revenues were down and profits before tax down our retail banking and wealth management and private banking businesses in the us were loss making in the year and profits in commercial banking and global banking and markets both fell by more than turning to the detail of the full year results on slide across most segments in our global businesses we saw a strong revenue growth in total adjusted revenues up in retail banking and wealth management revenues up including in retail banking due mainly to lending and deposit growth in hong kong latin america and in the uk and up in wealth management principally from higher life insurance revenue including positive market impacts in commercial banking revenues up with global liquidity and cash management up and credit and lending up trade finance had slower revenue growth in impacted by the ongoing uschina trade dispute within global banking and markets while revenues were down overall transaction banking showed good revenue growth up but global markets had a tougher year with revenues declining by and within global private banking revenues were up underpinned by our best net new money performance since on slide fourth quarter revenues were up overall or almost billion thats despite million of lower corporate centre revenues this quarter included a much stronger franchise by the wealth management franchise given the turnaround from weak markets in the fourth quarter of the previous year and our best fourth quarter revenue performance in global banking and markets for four years in commercial banking and retail banking we can begin to see the impact of lower policy rates with further headwinds expected in on the next slide adjusted net interesting income was broadly stable from the third quarter and the net interest margin was unchanged at basis points helped by lower provisions from uk redress programs and releases relating to argentinian hyperinflation hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 our asian franchise experienced some asset margin compression with the net interest margin down basis points and in the uk ringfenced bank while the headline net interest margin was up basis points excluding lower uk redress provisions the underlying net interest margin was broadly stable at around basis points turning to costs excluding the uk bank levy adjusted operating costs were up in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of our cost run rate this year was down by half and slightly better in the second half than the first and thats despite higher investment spend up from the previous year for your models in you should assume that our aim is to have adjusted operating costs broadly stable on and adjusted revenues down very modestly with rwa disposal costs taken to significant items turning to the next slide on credit credit costs were down basis points to basis points in the fourth quarter this reflected a number of items in the uk we reduced our allowances for economic uncertainty by million to million against this in hong kong we increased our overlay by million to million and we took incremental provisions in argentina of some million second half credit costs were basis points so were now at the low end of our expected to basis points of through the cycle range given the impact of the coronavirus we expect a continuing downturn in hong kong in the first half of this year and we anticipate that well need to take additional expected credit losses into our first quarter results i would caution however the impact of the virus could vary materially in part dependent on the time taken to contain the virus with additional expected credit losses only part of a broader potential set of financial impacts on the group including lower revenues and volumes and credit rating deterioration driving higher riskweighted assets on capital adequacy our core tier ratio improved basis points in the quarter to this reflected a material reduction in rwas in the fourth quarter that ill go into detail on the next slide we set out the detail of the riskweighted assets here of and return on tangible equity walks during for riskweighted assets weve reduced these by almost billion during the year with the bulk of this coming in the fourth quarter we took a very conscious decision to accelerate our riskweighted asset plans in global banking and markets resulting in a billion reduction in that business in the final quarter looking forward were sensitive to a number of potential headwinds and risks including a forecast first quarter rwa uplift of around billion due to modeling and regulatory changes and a similar amount from revenue growth for our return on tangible equity it declined by basis points during the year to this reflected a stable overall performance but was impacted by a 50basis point negative impact from intangible movements primarily due to present value inforce movements in our insurance business so to summarize on the financial performance before handing back to noel for the full year adjusted revenues up adjusted profits up in part reflecting much better cost discipline with positive jaws of over and a return on tangible equity of our core tier was up basis points in the year to in part due to a significant rwa reduction in global banking and markets however despite this continuing progress last year weve recognized the need to continue to drive up group returns to significantly improve areas of the group with low returns currently this requires a new cost and rwa reduction plan that noel will now step through hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 noel quinn chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks ewen ill talk about our plans to increase returns in a second but first i want to say a few words about the coronavirus outbreak this is clearly something were observing closely and id like to pay tribute to the resilience that our people have shown during this very difficult time and to thank them for their amazing commitment our first priority is obviously the wellbeing of our people and our customers and we will continue to do all that we can to provide support and ensure their safety there will inevitably be a shortterm economic impact that will doubtless affect our clients and we will do all that we can to support them however the longterm strategic importance and attractiveness of mainland china hong kong and the broader asian region remains unchanged and the region as a whole remains a key part of our strategy turning to our plan we intend to deliver on three action programs between now and we will implement an rwa upgrade program stripping out lowreturning rwas from the underperforming parts of our business and redeploying them into higherreturning areas we will execute a billion cost reduction program to reduce total costs even as we invest in the business and we will simplify hsbc to increase revenue synergies and accelerate the pace of execution we will target the following in a gross rwa reduction of more than billion a reduced cost base of billion or lower and a cet1 ratio in the range of to taken together these should help us achieve our main target of a return on tangible equity of to by with a fullyear benefit of cost reductions and redeployed rwas flowing into subsequent years to be clear i do not consider to be a ceiling for the group i think we can go higher and we will aspire to do so this is a deep and fundamental restructuring of the bank that will enable us to deliver on our strategy and our potential crucially its not dependent on market conditions its focused on things that we can control our first task is to upgrade the return profile of rwas we plan to remove more than billion of lowreturning rwas and reinvest them in high growth high returning activities in other parts of the business as you know we have a very strong heritage with a wholesale and personal client base centered around the faster growing higher returning markets of the world a differentiated proposition serving the banking needs of middle market entrepreneurial businesses globally a personal banking franchise grounded in three scale and attractive markets in hong kong the uk and mexico and a strong international wealth business with circa trillion of client assets that core franchise delivers strong inherent rote and sustainable growth potential these are the parts of the business that we want to continue to grow however as i mentioned at our q3 results we have parts of the organization our us business and the nonringfenced bank in the uk and continental europe that are not producing acceptable returns particularly in global banking and markets these are the businesses we intend to reshape lets start with europe we want to focus our footprint in europe on our international wholesale and transaction banking franchises and connect our clients better to our international network particularly asia and the middle east by we intend to reduce the net rwas in the nonringfenced bank by around and within that to reduce global banking and markets rwas by around hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 we also intend to reduce our nonringfenced bank costs by around we plan to do this by focusing our client coverage on clients that value our international network and presence particularly in asia and the middle east rather than serving pure domestic clients we will scale back the amount of capital we deploy to our rates business and exit capital and leverageintensive product lines such as g10 longterm derivative market making in the uk we will focus our european investment banking activities on supporting uk midmarket corporates and capital flows and transactions between europe and the fastergrowing markets of the world london will remain an investment banking hub to support our global clients we will reduce our equity sales and equity research activities in europe to match our client footprint and we will transition our structured product capabilities from the uk to asia where the opportunity for profitable growth is greater and well continue to reinvest in our transaction banking and financing capabilities weve recognized the need to take action to address our retail banking operations in france and a strategic review is ongoing we will provide an update on that review when it is appropriate to do so but we have not assumed any change to our current business model in the forecast shared with you today turning to the us we are one of the leading wholesale and transaction banking franchises and the leading trade bank in the world so we need a meaningful presence in the us but we need a new approach that generates acceptable returns as in europe were going to focus on our strengths well reposition hsbc usa as an international clientfocused corporate bank anchored in commercial banking and global banking with a focused retail offering for international and affluent clients this will be a fundamentally different business to todays we will consolidate select fixed income activity in london and reduce us global markets rwas by around we will reinvest the majority of the rwas saved into commercial banking and retail banking in commercial banking well expand our coverage of midmarket corporates who trade in the us and internationally and in retail banking we will expand our product offering and increase our investment in digital well refocus our retail banking presence to serve globally mobile clients reducing our branch network in the us by around we considered a number of options with respect to us retail banking including exiting it completely but our retail deposit base in the us provides an important source of stable liquidity for our wholesale banking and global transaction banking activities and we believe we can connect our personal banking operations in the us to our personal banking operations in the rest of the world just as we have in wholesale banking finally and partly as a consequence of these changes well embark upon a major cost and consolidation program in the us that should reduce our total costs by between and the big difference between this and previous us turnaround plans is that all of these changes are within our control we are not reliant on favorable market conditions and we have a new management team that is totally focused on delivering these plans the outcome should be a leaner more focused business delivering higher sustainable returns moving on to global banking and markets it is worth taking a step back and considering the type of business that we want global banking and markets to be we want to continue to serve large longterm capital providers public sector entities and global corporate and financial institutions who can use our international network particularly in the fastergrowing markets we want to do this as the top transaction bank and a leading global finance inhouse and to reinforce our position as the foremost international bank in asia and the middle east to deliver this we will invest in asia and the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 middle east to cement our position as a top three corporate and investment bank across both global banking and commercial banking clients we will continue to invest in our global transaction banking franchise to defend our market leadership and deliver sustainable growth we will strengthen our investment banking capabilities in asia and in the middle east while maintaining a global investment banking hub in london and we will build leading emerging markets and financing capabilities in global markets and enhance our institutional clients business we will also improve collaboration with other businesses currently global banking and markets and commercial banking both own their own products and operations capabilities they crosssell fairly successfully today but we want to offer our clients a much more integrated service to drive revenue synergies we will reorganize our product teams to serve both frontline businesses and to drive cost synergies well combine the operational support infrastructure for global banking and commercial banking we will also continue to invest in the digital systems and solutions that will improve the service we offer our clients so here is where we intend to reinvest the rwas that we save even in the current environment we see significant opportunities for growth our transaction banking businesses are a major revenue driver for the group and will continue to do so we have an excellent opportunity to build our international wealth franchise particularly in asia and among the international asian community asia as a whole is a core engine of growth for the business over the next few years we will continue to invest in the expansion of our business in china generally the greater bay area in particular and across southeast asia given our heritage in the middle east and the many market reforms that are taking place we are in a strong position to take advantage of the significant opportunities that will arise we also intend to continue capturing market share in the uk ringfenced bank as we have in recent quarters and we see strong growth momentum in our business in mexico we will also be investing more in technology improving our digital platforms to expand our reach and improve customer experience turning to cost reduction and simplification there are three paths to a reduced cost base and a simpler business first we will take out costs associated with the activities we choose to exit second well keep investing in technology to reengineer manual or legacy processes removing costs and improving the customer experience third we will organize ourselves in a less matrixed and fragmented fashion leading to lower cost increased accountability and greater agility the net effects of these changes will be a simpler more streamlined business we expect savings of billion from this cost program which will allow us to substantially reduce our cash run rate our intention is to target total adjusted costs of no more than billion in many of the changes were going to make will have a material impact on the cost and complexity involved in running the group first we will combine retail banking and wealth management and global private banking to create one new global business which we will call wealth and personal banking not only will this increase our ability to find revenue synergies within a much larger wealth business it means we can remove many layers and support structures associated with running two global businesses second and as i already mentioned we will merge the back and middle offices for our wholesale banking businesses this will help us sell more products to more clients but it will also reduce duplication and increase collaboration hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 third we are simplifying the way we manage our geographies where previously we had seven geographies we will now have four covering asia the uk the us and the rest of the world each of these will be represented on the group executive committee which will be smaller than before this will increase accountability reduce complexity and improve our ability to execute at pace fourth we will be able to reorganize our global functions to match the size and simplified structure of our frontline teams and finally we as an executive committee will be increasingly incentivized via our score cards to deliver the right outcome for the bank as a whole not just for our individual business units or functions this represents one of the deepest restructuring and simplification programs in our history it will help us not only to reduce our cost base but also to become a more collaborative empowered customercentric business while maintaining or enhancing our risk framework taken together these actions will significantly change the shape of the group the new wealth and personal banking business and commercial banking will occupy a greater share of rwas for the group while the share of global banking and markets will reduce from to less than on a geographical basis asia and the uk ringfenced bank will be the main beneficiaries from the reduction in rwas currently allocated to the nonringfenced bank and the us so in summary since q3 we have developed a detailed restructuring plan to address the lowreturn portfolios of europe and the us and to reshape global banking and markets we have plans to reallocate freedup capital into highergrowth higherreturn businesses and markets we have begun an ambitious simplification and cost reduction program while increasing it investment this is a robust plan built around things we can control predicated on reasonable revenue growth assumptions combined with significant cost reduction and capital efficiency programs we have reorganized our management structure to deliver a pace we have established a dedicated transformation team to focus on executing the restructuring with a separate team focused on building future growth strategies and since my appointment in august we have taken tough decisions to deliver quick results in the fourth quarter we reduced rwas by billion we reversed the direction of travel on both cost and head count and we refreshed the executive management team to position us for execution now we need to evidence continued delivery and i am totally committed to doing that back to you ewen ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel to take you through the broad financial implications of what noels just outlined we expect to have riskweighted assets in that are broadly in line with yearend with reductions in the nonringfenced bank the us and parts of global banking and markets increasing our capacity to invest in both planned growth and priority markets and to deal with the expected impact of regulatory changes over the same threeyear period were also planning a material reduction in the leverage exposure of global markets were targeting an annual cost base of billion or less in which translates into a return intangible equity in that year of to and we want to do those while maintaining our core tier ratio in the range of to for clarity these targets exclude the impact of any business disposals hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 on the next slide on riskweighted assets were planning to materially reduce rwas in the nonringfenced bank and to a lesser extent in the us and as a part of this and given that almost of the rwas across those two entities are global banking and markets related were specifically targeting a material reduction in capital allocation to that business largely offsetting this is planned growth in other franchises the core underlying rwa growth across the group is currently at around to per annum so over a threeyear period well largely offset the rwa reduction were planning on basel iii reform at this point weve become less concerned about the day one net impact we now see a relatively limited uplift post mitigating actions were planning to take on the next slide we set out where we expect the gross rwa reduction to be achieved the bulk of the reduction and revenue impact were targeting is expected to come from global banking and markets and to a lesser extent commercial banking the run down program is likely to take three years to execute with a dedicated team now set up to execute those the disposal losses of the rwa rundown program and global banking and markets is expected to cause in the order of billion and this will be taken into significant items spread mainly over and with the associated net revenue loss expected to be in the order of billion were also targeting a gross reduction and leverage exposure of billion in the nonringfenced bank in the us partially offset by around billion of anticipated growth in the global markets franchise in asia on the next slide we expect rwas at the end of to be broadly in line with where they were at the end of revenues will be impacted by the impact of lower interest rates and the assumed nonrepeat of certain positive revenue items in these items include positive market impacts in and disposal gains which in total totaled to around billion we intend to reduce rwas by over billion in areas generating low revenues to riskweighted assets with very high costincome ratios and we intend to redeploy these riskweighted assets in areas of higher revenue and lower costincome ratios particularly over the medium to longer term the reduction and redeployment of rwas and associated revenue impacts will be spread fairly evenly over the three years of our plan and we do expect further benefits from the redeployment of rwas to flow into and beyond on the next slide the targeted growth reduction in rwas help us fund the cost of the restructuring the underlying growth in rwas from our stronger performing franchises and the anticipated net impact of basel iii reform however our current group capital group returns are insufficient to fund both the natural growth in our business and to fully immunize this group dividend so in an order to bridge to when we expect to have higher returns were suspending the buyback for this year and next were also shifting our guidance on our core tier ratio were still targeting to be above but signaling today that over the next three years we expect to be at the higher end of a to range from onwards over the medium term as we target reducing gross peak to trough stress in the group and seek to further optimize todays capital inefficiency that comes from our subsidiary structure we plan to reduce our core tier ratio back to the lower end of the to range turning to costs we plan to substantially reduce our costs run rate to billion or better by given underlying inflation over this period and the expected reduction in the bank levy this reflects a real reduction in the order of with the shift to higher yielding rwas over the same period we expect a material operating profit improvement over the next three years the cost reductions broadly fall into three buckets direct cost savings relating to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 business reductions these amount to around of the total the organization simplification that noel has just outlined including a substantial restructuring of groups central costs this amounts to around of total savings and for the remainder technology investment that leads to increased levels of automation and productivity accounting to around of the total the cost program will require intense focus on delivery there are almost separate cost initiatives underpinning this progress will be monitored through a tight central oversight team with some of those cost initiatives starting today on slide we expect costs to achieve to have been substantially completed by with full run rate benefits achieved in subsequent years expected cost savings of billion from this new cost program are phased across the three years billion to be delivered in a further billion in and the remainder in we expect that additional restructuring costs in the order of billion will be required with more than of these costs incurred this year and next so to conclude from me before handing back to noel we believe were setting out an ambitious but realistic plan to achieve a number of objectives firstly to materially improve our overall group returns by that allows us both to grow how we want to grow and to fund our current distribution policy secondly to take capital and cost away from underperforming franchises so we can continue to invest where we have stronger returns and growth prospects and lastly to simplify our currently overly complex structure reducing the overall group and central costs and improving the capital efficiency of the group noel noel quinn chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks ewen so to quickly summarize strong revenue growth in our target areas and good cost discipline in a firm intention to grow returns create the capacity to invest and to build a platform for sustainable growth a robust plan to restructure our us and european businesses reposition global banking and markets and reallocate capital to higher growth businesses all while simplifying the group a path to a return on tangible equity of to in through a gross riskweighted asset reduction program of more than billion and a gross cost reduction of around billion by the end of we also have a strong ambition to seek additional strategic opportunities for growth and higher returns and a commitment to deliver with that were happy to take questions and i think richard will step up and richard oconnor headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks noel weve got some questions from the web but before we take some of those well take a few from the audience can i ask if you give your names that you should wait for the mic please and if we can at least to start with limiting to two per person and well try and go around a few times so well do a few from the floor to start and then go to the web from there raul hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 question and answer section raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc hi good morning its raul sinha from jpmorgan maybe two please one on the strategy i guess for the plan to work the capital redeployment will be the key element and i really appreciate the detail youve given us on where youre taking capital away but i was wondering if you could give us more detail about where youre going to put that capital into and apart from the areas internal geographies and businesses could you also talk about whether the plan is organic or whether also you might consider inorganic options noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc so ill deal with the second one first the plans that are before you and the forecast that are before you are all based on organic activity theres no inorganic assumed in those plans second on capital redeployment we still believe and have seen in strong growth in asia in the middle east in our uk business and we want to continue to fuel that growth and we see that growth continuing going forward weve also seen extremely strong growth in mexico let me just recall mexico today or in achieved a return on tangible equity of and that business has extremely strong growth momentum still in it so we want to provide that in terms of asia to be more specific we see still growth potential in our international commercial banking franchise that proposition is wellpositioned to continue to grow i think we have a unique and differentiated position in international midmarket audio gap ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc it goes both ways too equally theres no disposals built into these numbers so to the extent that theres disposals you should factor that on top of what were announcing today and in terms of organic growth id just point you to look some of the underlying growth rates that weve had in places like asia over the last decade and yes theres a near term impact from the coronavirus but we do think theres a secular growth opportunity in trade and wealth in asia over the next to years and that we are relatively uniquely placed currently to take advantage of that noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc just to give you one example of that in asia commercial banking i remember when i took over that business at the end of we had a balance sheet at that point of around about billion today that balance sheet is closer to i think billion and still has potential to grow so we want to continue to fuel that investment richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc martin hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international thank you yes good morning martin leitgeb from goldman sachs could i just followup on the capital comments earlier and i was just wondering under what timeframe should we consider hsbc to return to this kind of more normalized capital level of closer to the lower end of the to range rather than the range youre kind of signaling over the next three years for the restructuring period and the second question more strategically and i was just wondering hsbc uk sort of ringfenced bank how strategic do you consider it within the group context just bearing in mind obviously the limitation imposed by ring fencing on the utilization of retail deposits thank you noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc ill deal with the second one first we see it as a very strategically important part of the portfolio it generates inherently higher returns if you look at the underlying returns of the uk business and the uk market its an attractive market weve seen growth in market share and growth in our own business in both retail banking and commercial banking and we believe it will become increasingly connected to the rest of the world in a post brexit world so its strategically important ewen do you want to go to capital ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc indiscernible to go into a bit more detail on the comments and guidance around capital look in the very near term were obviously sensitive to the fact that were doing significant restructuring and the precise timing of restructuring charges and rwa rundown over that period can vary and hence why we want some capital flexibility secondly the final rules on basel reform havent been settled so what you see embedded in the numbers today is a net increase of less than so if we go back i think if i presenting views about a year ago and when i was reluctant to do so it was because we could see that there was a path to significant mitigation in the medium term weve got two big structural issues that were working through as a bank firstly we have enormous complexity in the group because of the subsidiary structure our largest single balance sheet has less than of the group assets if you compare us to us peers typically of one balance sheet is the dominant balance sheet in the group as a result we have an enormous amount of capital and efficiency across the group were also subject to markets where in some markets for example were held to standardized rules and not able to take advantage of advanced modeling so theres a progressive work plan on that over the next few years and the second issue that were dealing with is weve still got i think a significant level of peaktotrough stress across the group some of that is getting addressed as part of this restructuring for example were planning to substantially reduce the principal investment business that sits in the nonringfenced bank one of the core reasons for doing that is not the fact that it produces attractive returns under base but under stress it has enormous stress characteristics so i think if we can make progress and solve those and make progress on those two issues i think we can comfortably reduce down to the lower end of that range in terms of timing thats why i use language of medium term because its difficult to be precise hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc claire just behind martin claire kane q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning its claire kane from credit suisse a couple of followups firstly on the capital in the event that youre unable to redeploy all the rwas and i do know your plan to redeploy them in quite low riskweighted asset businesses in rbwm and transaction banking and the capital ratio was to go well north of your range over the next two years would you consider buying back shares or would you rather that was all built up to and what is the basis for your rote target so the tnav clearly if you built up a lot of surplus capital that would dilute returns so should we expect that you are in the mid area of your to range by and all surplus capital will be distributed at that point ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc well look on the latter point first i think weve said that we expect to be at the higher end of the range in so embedded in that to rote target is the higher end of the to core tier being held in that year the other thing i would say on returns is we dont think is a clean year either for revenues because weve reinvested revenues into new customer relationships where the revenue build up takes time and secondly we havent got full run rate costs in so we do think that there is further upside on the return as you go out on capital i mean firstly i mean we have a high degree of confidence i guess in our ability to redeploy billion of rwas over the next three years if we would have end up in a scenario where that wasnt the case were not going to just sit and allow our capital ratios to accrete well in excess of what we need them to do but its our current expectation that were not doing buybacks for two years if that was to change because the rwa profile and the capital position of the bank was very very different we would relook at it at that point noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc and just on the reasonableness of our growth assumptions even today with all of the challenges that exist around coronavirus were seeing a strong pipeline of activity in our business globally in so i think were very confident that we can deliver that growth plan weve had deliver that or more in the past so we believe we have made reasonable assumptions on the growth and that it can be delivered richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc before we go to the floor lets start a couple from the web on the coronavirus firstly do your your q4 ph acr assumptions do they take into account the coronavirus indiscernible 31st of december and secondly one from jason napier of ubs dbs made some revenue guidance recently on the impact of coronavirus can you talk a little bit more about the expected impacts from that please ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 yeah so for accounting purposes coronavirus is a post balance sheet event so its not in our for the economic guidance at that point it will be obviously reflected in forward economic guidance as a part of q1 reporting to give you some numbers embedded into our disclosures in the annual report and accounts today is various adverse scenarios for hong kong economic performance whats the downside the most extreme downsides scenario in there i would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year if you look at that and that was to become the central scenario there would be about million of additional loan losses provisions required we dont think were going to be in any way to like that in q1 but its not the only revenue and its not the only pl impact and capital impact as i said earlier there will be revenue impacts which will become progressively more acute if the coronavirus was to continue beyond the next month to six weeks there would also be the risk of credit rating migration amongst the wholesale book in hong kong which would lead to rwa inflation we think that the q1 impact as we sit here today is probably range bound in the order of about million to million relative to our previous planning assumptions i think if the virus is still prevailing beyond that it will come back as part of q1 reporting to give you a much ph fuller update on what we think the impact is at that point but it really is a yeah when we look at the modeling its really a call long predominantly a call at this point on how long does it take to contain the virus when you look across the various scenarios that were trying to model at the moment but underlying that i think when you look at the underlying credit performance of the book as noel said q1 was good q4 was good and january was certainly robust we are getting some positive offsets against this because hibor in particular continues to remain elevated relative to the previous planning assumptions as well richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc theres a few questions from the web from the likes of tom rayne jason napier and manus costello on can you talk a little bit more about the revenue loss from the rwa reductions and the time thereof the timing of reinvestment should you expect revenue losses earlier in the plan and a hockey stick towards the end can we just have a little bit more detail on the billion reductions and billion reinvestment please ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah so theres we thought we were providing a decent amount of guidance but it appears that theres still a few gaps yeah youll see in one of the charts that weve got in the presentation some sort of bar charts and please dont get your rulers out to try and measure across but for global banking and markets weve signaled about a billion reduction as a result of the rwa rundown that excludes the that excludes the costs associated with the rundown which we will treat as a significant item we do think offsetting that will be some degree of revenue improvement over the next three years therefore we think order of magnitude global banking and markets revenues will probably be down on the order of about billion relative to last years run rate by the time we get to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 and the material impact as you can see on the bar charts that are in the slides is in global banking and markets for overall weve talked about a very modest reduction in revenue impact weve got interest rate headwinds weve set that out about billion of lower interest income as a result of reduction in rates thats been going on in and some assumed reduction in the bulk of that will hit weve got about billion of oneoffs that were in that were not expecting a repeat off in terms of our forecasting offsetting that is a decent amount of growth that were continuing to see in our underlying business and i think the last part of that was the timing across the yeah broadly we think the revenue reduction from the rwa runoff and the revenue growth from the rwas were putting on is evenly sort of spread in terms of the buildup and rundown over the threeyear period noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc but id add one other point and that is one of the reasons we do in the organizational simplification and the cost reduction program is to make sure we have some mitigation so that we dont end up with stranded costs should the revenue go down on the reduction program for rwas but there will be a time lag for the revenue coming up elsewhere so i think youve got to take the two in the round its the revenue reduction build on the rwa redeployment program and the cost reduction program that gives us more assurance on managing the situation richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc more from the floor guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas morning its guy stebbings from exane bnp paribas can i come back firstly to capital being created from the plan if we think about the billion of gross takeout that youre guiding to but in the plan no buybacks before so youve only got the ordinary dividend which most people would have had in their numbers i mean should we be inferring that the plan itself doesnt release any capital if you do redeploy but incremental to that its really about any business proposals which creates that additional capacity is that the right way to be thinking about to ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc im just going to think about that for a second so the billion of rwa reduction would release billion to billion of capital for us offset by the after tax cost of the restructuring cost and the rwa rundown cost so that still creates capital in that program but its all embedded in the statements around the suspension of the buyback for two years the second yeah the second part of the question is guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas well its just if were looking a capital ratio in broadly aligned where we are today were saying no buybacks before implicitly that assumes that theres no net capital release versus our previous guidance but youre obviously not including within that any disposals which seems like it could be the big delta hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah if those disposals create value i mean obviously it depends on the realization process proceeds of those disposals so possibly but i dont i mean if you think about some of the stuff thats been ph speculated about in the press just remember that we have a lot of net worth markets that are relatively small if we were to dispose of any of them i dont think its going to have a material impact on our capital base overall so yeah the big drivers is things like interest rates the speed of the rwa rundown the speed of the redeployment yeah all of that is going to have a far greater impact on the capital position of the bank guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas can i just come back to the capital target quickly and the peaktotrough stresses that you referenced but if we look at the bank of england stress test and we look at the other component parts of the capital stack consider some trapped capital it still feels like quite a conservative target so is this very much an internal stress that youre applying which is ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc its certainly not driven by what the regulators think we will always drive our capital targets by the ph horror of regulatory constraints and what we think we have a more conservative view than the pra and where our capital position should be i think look an offset to that is we are the best rated of the uk banks as you know with our credit ratings we get wholesale funding cost therefore that are substantially cheaper than our competitors weve always wanted to position ourselves as a very strongly rated strong balance sheet bank we get the benefit of that through funding costs but its certainly not driven by any conversation weve been having with the pra guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas so we cant lean on new banking and disclosure on stress testing this year as a guide its more about ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc no no no the stress testing issue is our own internal issue its something that weve recently strengthened our stress testing team under new leadership and we do think that we can make material progress over the next few years on reducing the peaktotrough delta that were seeing in our stress test results richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc magdalena magdalena l stoklosa q analyst morgan stanley co international plc thanks very much could you give us a little bit more sense of your cost trajectory thats particularly slide that im referring to kind of what assumptions are embedded in your severance costs over the next over the time of hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 the restructuring but also if you could give us the direction of where the investments go and also the sense of a flex in that cost base so weve got the billion at the end of should the revenue surprise on the upside or the downside how will that number flex to noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc if you can tell me how the revenues will flex ill tell you how the costs flex i mean clearly weve positioned the cost base to be in the context of the revenue growth opportunity at the moment based on the current assumptions we believe billion or less is an appropriate position should the economy and the growth be better well invest in the business should it be different well take a different course of action ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc and you can see on slide there was a lightgray bar there that has a significant component of investment and growth but broadly we expect costs to be flat down down in the next three years and getting down to billion by the time you take the underlying inflation rate in the bank at the moment its about per annum we are expecting million that order of magnitude reduction in the bank levy from onwards if you back those two out i mean whats embedded in the plan is about a reduction in real terms but importantly theres a significant component in there for growth investment if we dont see the growth coming well just scale back that growth investment magdalena l stoklosa q analyst morgan stanley co international plc and the severance noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc pardon richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc severance ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc well the detailed assumption is based on where people are leaving and what the cost of them leaving which vary substantially across the world so severance costs in continental europe as you know are substantially higher than they are in other parts of the world but all of that is reflected into the numbers and weve provided breakdown on one of the slides of what breakdown of the cost to achieve that with about ph of that i think is severance related richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc and we gave you the timing of that cta as well so you have that timing in the slide hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc but i think the other important thing to remember on some of the job cut numbers that have been stated today we currently have attrition of people a year so in the context of the job number over three years we anticipate about people leaving the bank naturally over the next three years and if we can be smart on recruitment against that we can materially reduce head count over a threeyear period without having to pay any severance cost against that aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning guys its aman rakkar from barclays im just going to come back to capital and run the risk of asking too detailed question its just to interrogate the kind of cautiousness that the message thats coming across regarding capital i mean basically when i do some pretty crude backoftheenvelope math it does look like you are going to accrete pretty significant capital over the planned period even if you do redeploy the billion of rwas i mean basically if profits are broadly maintained to the current level youre going to pay away basically half of that in the dividend post the scrip and if i times that by obviously we got to take out the restructuring charge it does basically like youre going to build about basis points to basis points of capital from where you are now so well above i mean first of all is there anything there that you disagree with and secondly does that mean that theres some kind of intangible asset build or some cet1 deduction that we should be mindful of over the planned period ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah its hard to have the debate in the absence of numbers but it feels a little bit high i mean maybe if you can sort of step through your model with ph ir afterwards we can figure out why but lets sort of go back to claires question earlier if we see our capital ratio is accreting comfortably above were not going to allow that to happen and we will manage our capital base appropriately for how much capital we need and the same way in we undertook billion buyback as we felt we had the capacity to do that so we did it so if we are being cautious thats a good thing and if we do accrete more capital then we think because of our caution then well take against that richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc a couple on hong kong from the web one from ronit ghose the q4 asia nim down basis points is that the effective run rate for asia nim going forward can you talk a little about that and then from ph vincent gu asking about the stage growth in hong kong balances in second half and provide a bit more color on what drove that please ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah on asia nim we did see some asset margin compression the other thing is a significant portion of the hong kong deposit base is us dollar based so us dollar interest rates are down so you will see ongoing impact of that given since ive arrived at the bank trying to predict the trajectory of hibor but were obviously very sensitive to the trajectory of hibor and in some ways as i said earlier its sort of linked to the coronavirus hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 where its remaining high at the moment but we would expect hibor this year and weve got that in our economic forecast to decline at some point during the year in terms of the stage i mean look hong kong pre the coronavirus has been facing some difficult economic circumstances and all youre seeing is the natural migration i think of that credit book but richard will have the numbers but the underlying if you looked ph without the quality of hong kong credit book is yeah you have to imagine some extremely difficult scenarios as i said earlier its shifting to assuming coronavirus continues for most of this year only gets you to incremental provisioning of million in hong kong so we dont expect anything like that but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay ian over in your corner ian gordon q analyst investec bank plc hi ian gordon from investec can i just have one question on the us please correct me if im wrong but i dont think theres any suggestion that the us will ever be anything other than a drag to group returns so obviously i welcome what youve announced retaking capital out of gbm and slashing costs within the retail business but in terms of the reallocation within that geography is it based on genuine enthusiasm for the opportunities you see or is it based on some other structural restriction eg scale requirements time it takes to extract capital under ccar or something else noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc we do see the plan delivering acceptable returns in the us business over the mediumterm so we see a significant increase in returns thats a combination of the reduction in the balance sheet in the global markets business a refocusing at the retail business we do believe there is an opportunity to serve international clients in the us but we also believe its important to have a stable balance sheet in the us to support our global market leading capabilities in transaction banking and trade and that the package together is the right package we did look hard at what we do in the us and did we look to dispose of the retail business we looked hard at that we dont think thats the right answer to be honest if i wanted an easy headline and i wanted an easier day to day id have just made the decision to sell the us retail business but i genuinely dont believe thats the right answer for us as a bank i dont think its the right answer for our business in the us or for our business globally you got to remember we are the market leader in global transaction banking business and circa of that transaction banking business is denominated in us dollars we cannot put that business at risk by having a subscale inappropriate or highrisk business in the us that is not able to fund itself so that is an important part ph our buy in hsbc is that global transaction banking business now many people said we wouldnt be able to turn around the mexico retail business five six years ago and were advising us to sell that at that point in time well nunos here in the room today him and his management team in mexico have done an excellent job that business today is growing significantly doubledigit yearonyear and high doubledigit and is generating return on tangible equity today of with strong momentum for future growth we have to achieve that same outcome in the us not just because of the us business because of what it means to be in the us for our broader hsbc strategy hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 so the easier decision for me would have been to make the sale decision the harder decision gets me less headlines today and possibly less support is to do what we believe is right for the bank and thats the decision weve taken and well give our team the support to do it please remember as well weve chosen a strategy for retail banking now that is different to the past in the past on the east coast we were largely a mass market full service subregional bank in retail banking on the west coast we were more of an affluent internationallyorientated bank i dont think its appropriate to run both strategies together alongside each other its inconsistent if were to choose a strategy for retail banking in the us its to support the international and more affluent sector of the marketplace in the us and our belief is thats a big market segment its in excess of million people our brand plays into that market segment well its our job to make sure we can do it profitably and thats what well be focused on but its a big enough market segment to be meaningful in fact its bigger than most countries were in frankly and i know i dont believe you have to be a fullservice national bank in the us in order to make money but we have to prove that to you over time ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc theres also just a couple of other things that you wont to see on the capital side and the headline numbers that while i talked about a sort of less than uplift on day one because of basel reform in the us theres about a uplift in the numbers so while were showing you a sort of stable rwa picture actually that reflects a significant reduction in rwas offset by anticipated inflation so the basel reform across the globe is not uniform in how it impacts different legal entities the second thing is today if you look at the us filings you will see that us rwas are about higher than pra rwas so a significant part of this plan is optimizing that gap and there is significant equity release thats embedded in this plan out of the us business back to the group over the next three to four years part of that goes to some of the structural issues that i was talking about earlier in terms of the double leverage and subsidiary complexity that were dealing with richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc joe and then joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi its joe dickerson from jefferies i guess this is the first restructuring plan post crisis that really seeks to address the middle and back office can you give us a sense of how much head count is going to actually come out of what we used to call the corporate centre or corporate hq secondly i see that you made a small release of the uk uncertainty overlay and theres i think million left in that provision which is a little bit higher than the low end of what youre calling out for coronavirus what do you need to see to release the remainder of that is it certainty of a trade bill what are the things we need to look for because theres pretty much an offset there hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc ill let ewen answer the second one and ill give you an answer on the first if i can were not giving individual head count targets or detail at this stage on either any subregion or business line or the centre what i will say is i firmly believe that its absolutely important to not only reduce the cost of the superstructure of hsbc in order to provide some mitigation to the rwa redeployment program so that i dont end up with stranded costs but i also think its an important thing to do to empower the organization with greater agility and greater pace to delayer dematrix and i think weve had a structure in place that served us well post the financial crisis and through the dpa we had to build up a more substantial complex support structure for the businesses during that period but i think in a phase that were going into we need more agility and simplicity and therefore that requires our central cost base to go down and i want to recreate a much more clinical divide between what is the holding company or the group of hsbc and that which should be there separate from that which should be in the countries to allow the countries to make growth happen and so im not going to give you any specific head count targets on that we can help you try to model that later but nothing at this point in time on the second point ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah weve broken out in one of the slides about of the cost savings are coming from the middle office and sort of just personalize it to the bit i run i mean if you look at the finance department today very manual with sort of poor customer control and cost outcomes as a result of that weve got a three to fouryear plan to create a single data warehouse and heavily use the cloud which should lead to a dramatic improvement in the productivity of the department as a result of that and we can see similar efficiency programs across much of the back office and middle office and weve just got a new coo john hinshaw whos got a deep background in technology and has led similar restructurings at other organizations hes led so again both on technology side and the operations side again we see significant opportunity for efficiency benefits all of which are reflected in todays cost announcement on the uk overlay i think part of what youre seeing is the fact that stressing the uk portfolio under extreme stress results in higher levels of provisioning than you would see in hong kong because it goes back to the fundamental credit quality of the hong kong business rather than any reflection on the uk post the big triggering event in q4 for the writeback of part of the overlay was the election which reduced some of the probabilities associated with some of the downside scenarios i think in terms of releasing a significant amount of further overlay in the uk were just going to have to see how the forward economic guidance shifts during the year with yeah theres still quite a broad spectrum of use around the uk economy particularly as we continue to negotiate the exit from europe this year noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc i will say on the uk economy it surprised me on the upside how resilient the uk corporate base has been through the three years leading up to the point were at now richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 one more from the web and then well take two more from the floor raul and jon still lots of questions on rwas and capital and buybacks as you would expect so one with a slightly different lever from manus costello is your plan assumes to growth in organic rwas to fund that youd need to get a return above right at the top of your to rote target what happens if you dont reach to that top end of the range how will you fund growth in the future or is the dividend at risk thats from manus costello noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc well firstly let me just and ewen will cover it but let me first of all make a comment the rwas we taken out are probably yielding at the moment between to the rwas weve put in back in were assuming will yield much closer to to so just taking out one the rwas and redeploying them youre getting a revenue and a margin uplift as a consequence of that because actually the market segments is going back into a higher yielding return than the market segments thats coming out of so youre going to get that margin enhancement as a consequence of that transformation program ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah i dont think the math was right actually in terms of needing to get to the top end of the to rote range for the reinvestment thats not whats embedded in the numbers theres a significant amount of growth embedded in the plan thats not particularly rwa intensive particularly around some of the wealth management franchise so look ultimately in order for the group to be sustainable with this distribution policy we need to be targeting returns of about to return on tangible equity we think this plan delivers that by we dont think is optimized for returns as i talked about earlier were right at the topend of that to range on capital we think we can further optimize that and we think theres more revenue upside as we get the benefit of the reinvestment of the rwas and we think weve got the full run rate benefit of cost still to come through into but the previous plan that we set out in june just over months ago was very much premised on getting to that rote that we think we need to be the interest rate environment fundamentally changed on us interest rates are probably about basis points lower than what we thought that were going to be when that plan was set up so hence why weve had to adjust the plan we think this plan gets us back to that place by and we think it has inherent logic to it which allows us to sustain the distribution policy and grow the back at about that to growth rate richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc raul and then jon raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc okay a couple of followups from me the capital ratio looks like its going to go backwards in q1 so just wondering if i can follow up on what you said in your opening remarks ewen theres billion of model changes and theres billion of inflation from is that from business growth hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yes so we think over this year theres probably about well first of all on the capital ratios i think it wouldnt be surprising if it fell back about basis points on the quarter id heavily caveat that because it depends on coronavirus but we think theres about billion of headwinds this year on regulatoryrelated modeling related issues that were for which about billion or just under billion should come through this quarter the other billion that well see is relating to business growth part of that theres always a significant reduction in balance sheet in q4 particularly around balance sheet management and part of gbm that comes back on early in the new year but also were continuing to see decent growth in retail banking and commercial banking so our current guidance is rwas will be up about billion or so in q1 raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you and the second one is on gbm specifically i think in the past weve looked at divisional returns across hsbc and im struggling to kind of go back to that maybe its not relevant anymore but can you talk about where the standalone gbm returns would look like under your plan relative to the to post the merging of the middle and the back office ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah my only hesitation because weve also got the corporate centre reallocation process that were intending to roll out in the second half of this year which has some impact on the returns but this materially improves the return profile of gbm through the period of the plan raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc is that in the to or its still below ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah sorry im just struggling to get the numbers right in my head post the reallocation but relative to the current returns the returns are materially high raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc last question john at the back john cronin q analyst goodbody stockbrokers ulc thank you its john cronin from goodbody just a few specifically on the uk actually in relation to flow share development and mortgages and the yeartodate anything you can say on that additionally the recent modest hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 improvement and deposit funding conditions in the market how do you anticipate that will pass through in terms of pricing or should there should we expect potentially some nim accretion there and finally anything you can say on the rotes youre currently printing on new mortgage flow i think you gave us some numbers on that before thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc so in terms of flow share in q4 from mortgages was just over so were continuing quarteronquarter to put on flow share in excess of stock share and mortgages in the uk we think we can continue to do that as weve talked about previously we have about a to share of current accounts by value we have about share of consumer credit and were sitting at just under share of our stock mortgages so we do think there is a longterm opportunity for us to continue to accrete share in mortgages on nim i would be a bit cautious because it continues to be we dont have it but the term funding scheme needs to be refinanced by the sector its not obvious to me how that gets refinanced without some pressure on deposit funding at some point the new the return on tangible equity for the new business on mortgages is comfortably ahead of cost of capital its very rote equivalent because of relatively there are risk weightings attached to that business the other thing i would say on the return overall in the uk return on tangible equity the uk it is impacted because we have a very large pension surplus that pension surplus helps in terms of a stress test because we dont need to hold capital against the pension plan for the stress test because weve got the surplus but if you were to adjust all that out i think returns for the uk business would be a couple of hundred basis points higher than we showed noel quinn a chief executive officer executive director hsbc holdings plc id just like to add a couple of comments as well about our plans to create a combined wealth and personal banking business there are two principal drivers behind that one is and probably the most important one is revenue synergy we believe that bringing the wealth management capability of our private bank and to be able to extend that product capability and our services to a broader client base gives us significant growth opportunities in revenue across the whole personal customer base equally we believe there are benefits in sharing the architecture and the skills that are being developed in and the capabilities that are being developed in our retail banking business particularly in the area of digitization now we can transfer those benefits into for the benefit of our private bank clients so we believe there are opportunities for growth and revenue from bringing those two businesses together there are also some cost synergies but that is not the primary purpose for doing it the primary purpose for doing it is to facilitate future growth some of the benefits will be the scale operations that are being built up in retail banking can be leveraged to continue to grow our private banking proposition for our private banking clients at a much faster pace without having to correspondently grow the cost base alongside it so we believe that combination is a powerful one does and we also believe the opportunity for continued growth in our business in the area of wealth management is one that we should focus on and were looking at further activities and strategies that can take that business on to even higher growth rates so i just wanted to add that to the comment on the uk retail business hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18feb2020 richard oconnor headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thats no more formal questions theres tea and coffee at the back
