president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan and good morning everybody as youve seen this morning our results for the second quarter had a number of moving parts including obviously the gain on the sale of our stake in blackrock overall i thought it was a pretty solid quarter in the context of the environment that were operating in you would have seen that revenue was down from the first quarter which if you remember included some kind of oneoff gains and expenses were wellmanaged we were able to produce positive operating leverage both in q2 and for the first half of the year however as we mentioned in our first quarter call our view of the economy has substantially worsened since we closed the books three months ago and in turn has resulted in a substantial loan loss reserve build our recent ccar results should lay to rest any concern that this is a pncspecific balance sheet problem the ccar results underscore the strength of our balance sheet which coupled with the benefits of the monetization of our blackrock investment positioned pnc with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our constituents and capitalize on opportunities that can arise during disrupted markets in fact our capital ratios are at record levels and we saw a significant increase in our book value looking ahead i fully recognize that we are perhaps a bit more pessimistic than the market on the odds of a full recovery anytime soon while recent economic data has been encouraging were still in the very early innings of how this is going to play out massive fiscal and monetary stimulus has allowed us to in fact kick the can down the road in terms of feeling the real effects of this recession much is going to depend on continuing support from the government as the economy continues to adjust with life with covid the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 unfortunately what is becoming very clear at least to me is that there is a new normal that will have profound and lasting effects on parts of our economy and the workforce that supports it despite these challenging times in which youre navigating simultaneous crises both the pandemic and civil unrest caused by deep racial inequities pnc has remained steadfast in our commitment to our customers communities employees and shareholders despite the challenges of covid we continue to make good progress in terms of executing on our key strategic focus areas including national middle market expansion and our national digital effort now before i turn it over to rob i want to recognize and thank our employees who are going above and beyond to help our customers address the many challenges that they are facing i also want to thank my leadership team including carole brown and richard bynum the newest members of our executive committee for their invaluable support during this time and finally i want to thank our board of directors for their leadership as we continue to navigate what has been a year of both extraordinary challenges and opportunities now ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our second quarter results and then well be happy to take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone as bill just mentioned and notable during the second quarter we divested our equity investment in blackrock which generated billion in net proceeds with an aftertax gain of billion pncs portion of blackrock results both second quarter activity and prior periods are now reported on a or as discontinued operations our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis on the asset side total loans grew billion to billion linked quarter investment securities of billion increased billion or our cash balances at the federal reserve averaged billion and were billion at the end of the quarter the significant increase was the result of liquidity from the sale of our investment in blackrock and strong deposit growth on the liability side deposit balances averaged billion for the quarter and were up billion or linked quarter total borrowed funds decreased billion compared to the first quarter importantly on a spot basis borrowed funds declined approximately billion as we used excess liquidity to reduce borrowings primarily with the federal home loan bank and our tangible book value was per common share as of june an increase of linked quarter and yearoveryear as you can see on slide our capital reserve and liquidity positions are all strong as of june our basel iii common equity tier ratio was estimated to be our board recently approved a quarterly dividend of per share which is consistent with the previous quarter as you know the fed has authorized dividends for the third quarter subject to amounts not exceeding the average of net income for the proceeding four quarters on this basis our third quarter dividend is of our average net income for the prior four quarters in regard to share repurchases and in accordance with the federal reserves guidance well continue to suspend share repurchases through the third quarter with the exception of permissible employee benefitrelated purchases our loan loss reserve levels have increased substantially in light of the current economic conditions and are now at we remain core funded with a low cost deposit base and importantly our liquidity coverage ratios significantly exceed the regulatory minimum requirements the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 slide shows our average loans and deposits in more detail average loan balances of billion in the second quarter were up billion or compared to the first quarter this growth reflected an increase in commercial loan balances of approximately billion driven by higher utilization related to line draws shortterm liquidity facilities to support our clients and new loan balances under the paycheck protection program consumer loans declined approximately million reflecting lower activity in card auto and student loans its worth noting that spot loans declined billion predominantly related to lower commercial loan utilization our cib segment experienced a decline in utilization rates from peak levels as approximately of the lines that were drawn were subsequently paid down at quarterend utilization rates were approximately above precovid rates compared to the same period a year ago average loans grew or billion as the slide shows the yield on our loan balances declined basis points to in the second quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the feds basis point reduction in interest rates during the first quarter which drove libor rates lower as well the rate paid on our deposits also declined basis points linked quarter to basis points average deposit balances of billion increased billion or linked quarter commercial deposits grew reflecting the enhanced liquidity positions of our customers due to covid19 concerns consumer deposits also grew primarily due to government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending yearoveryear deposits increased billion or as you can see on slide second quarter total revenue was billion down million linked quarter or net interest income of billion was up million or compared to the first quarter as higher earning asset balances and lower funding costs offset lower yields our net interest margin decreased to down basis points linked quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during march and the related decline in other market rates noninterest income of billion declined million or linked quarter fee revenue decreased million or consumer services and service charges on deposits declined by million in total due to lower consumer activity and fee waivers in the second quarter residential mortgage production volumes and loan sales revenues were both higher but were more than offset by a lower rmsr valuation and asset management and corporate services remained relatively stable other noninterest income declined million reflecting lower securities gains partially offset by strong client activity in corporate securities and capital markets noninterest expense declined million or compared to the first quarter due to lower business activity as well as continued progress on our cost savings initiatives related to our continuous improvement program as bill mentioned we generated positive operating leverage for the second quarter both yearoveryear and yeartodate provision for credit losses was billion reflecting a worsening in our economic outlook relative to march which ill provide more detail on in a moment and our effective tax rate was slide is an update to the template we introduced in the first quarter regarding specific industries weve identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic our outstanding loan balances as of june to these industries are billion and represent approximately of our total loan portfolio we havent yet experienced any material chargeoffs in these industries however if current economic trends continue well see chargeoffs increase over time the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 corporate loan balances in these industries totaled billion an increase of approximately million since march resulting from funding of billion of ppp loans excluding the ppp loans balances are down approximately nonperforming loans in these industries were flat linked quarter at just under of loan outstanding but criticized assets did grow during the quarter with the greatest stress seen in leisure recreation and travel we have billion in loans to high impact industries in our commercial real estate portfolio a decrease of approximately million since the end of march nonperforming loans in the real estate categories increased from approximately million at march to just over million driven almost entirely by a single mall reit related credit similar to last quarter we continue to see substantial stress in the retail and lodging segments turning to slide this is an update on our oil and gas portfolio which at the end of the second quarter was billion or less than of total outstanding loans outstanding loan balances have declined approximately million since march as expected we continue to see an increase in the nonperforming loans which now represent approximately of current outstandings in this portfolio we believe were properly reserved for this portfolio and well continue to monitor market conditions turning to slide were continuing to provide relief and flexibility to our customers through loan modifications during these uncertain times with our consumer customers were granting loan modifications through extensions deferrals and forbearance new requests for modifications have declined from their peak in early april but yeartodate weve granted assistance to nearly customer accounts representing billion of loans billion of which is investorowned and billion which is bankowned of the billion bankowned modifications they continue to represent a small percentage of both overall accounts and total loan exposures for each asset class and a significant percentage of clients have made at least one payment in the last days although these payments suggest a potential decrease in modifications as extension periods begin to expire we believe its too early to make that conclusion on the commercial side were offering emergency relief for small and mediumsized businesses including through the ppp loans were also selectively granting loan modifications to commercial clients based on each individual borrowers situation our credit quality metrics are presented on slide net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million a million increase from the first quarter annualized net chargeoffs to total loans remain stable at basis points total delinquencies of billion at june declined million or reflecting a decline in delinquencies related to the cares act as well as other forbearance and extension ph fees nonperforming loans increased million or compared to march the increase was primarily driven by commercial real estate borrowers and the high impact covid19 industries as well as borrowers in the energy industry which i previously mentioned as you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans has increased to in the second quarter compared to last quarter primarily resulting from our updated economic forecasts which incorporated significant covid19 impact on the economy importantly we believe the economic assumptions used in the scenarios to generate our cecl reserve estimates this quarter sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in our current portfolio therefore we dont anticipate any substantial reserve builds during the remainder of based on these assumptions which i will cover next the recent ccar results highlight the quality of pncs loan portfolio under the severely adverse scenario our cumulative losses as a percentage of our total portfolio were lower than most of our peers however based on our economic outlook under the cecl methodology we did have a substantial increase in our allowance this quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 slide highlights the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses our attribution shows the increase in reserves of million for portfolio changes and approximately billion for economic factors our weighted average economic scenario is derived from four separate scenarios and uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being gdp and the unemployment rate in this scenario annualized gdp contracts in the third quarter of finishing the year down from the fourth quarter levels and recovering to prerecession peak levels by the first quarter of additionally this scenario assumes the quarterly unemployment rate falls to in the fourth quarter of this year from a peak at in the second quarter with the labor market continuing to recover in and for internal analytical purposes we also considered hypothetically what our capital ratios would be if we had a year end allowance for credit losses equal to the ninequarter fed ccar severely adverse scenario losses of billion essentially frontloading an incremental billion in reserves over the next few quarters i want to emphasize the scenario is not our expectation but simply approximate the possible outcome under a hypothetical severe condition the analysis resulted in a cet1 ratio of approximately at december a level well above which is our regulatory minimum of plus our stress capital buffer of in summary from a capital liquidity and loan loss reserve perspective we believe our balance sheet is well positioned for this challenging environment clearly the biggest variables impacting the economy continue to be the duration of this crisis and the efficacy of the massive us government support and stimulus programs at this time we have no way of knowing these outcomes and visibility remains low within that context our guidance for the third quarter and our thoughts for the fullyear are as follows for the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of we expect average loans to decline in the low singledigit range we expect net interest income to be down approximately we expect total noninterest income to be down between and which includes our expectation that core fee revenue will be stable while other noninterest income will be lower in the quarter we expect total noninterest expense to be flat to down and in regard to net chargeoffs we expect third quarter levels to be between million and million for the fullyear and again i want to emphasize the context and limitation of low visibility we now expect both revenue and noninterest expense to each be down between and and our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the lowteens and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions bryan k gill executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc carlos could we please have the first question the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning john william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just want to see if you can talk a little bit about the margin i know the you expect in your outlook spread revenue to be down about in the third quarter how do you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi what does that mean in terms of your margin expectations going into the third quarter and then i guess through the back half of the year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey john its rob good morning we dont provide nim guidance so to speak because its an outcome but i would say generally speaking i expect margins to remain sort of stable well clearly see some lower yields as a function of rates being lower but we also have some more room on the liability side so i think largely theyll offset william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but we have i mean we also have all the ppp fees showing up the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were likely to see that spike in the fourth quarter on yields robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph see it more in the fourth quarter william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah so we might see a little bit of a lift in the fourth quarter but essentially these are the nim levels where i think well be at for some time william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi right okay all right thats helpful and then separately bill i just want to see if you can give us an update on your thoughts around the potential deployment of the blackrock capital if your thought process has changed at all since you completed the sale of the stake and if you could just give us just how youre thinking about ultimately putting that to work thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no real changes were going to be patient here i think like i said in my script were in pretty early innings here to see how this all plays out the fiscal payments that the governments put out plus what the feds done is effectively masked what are some pretty severe underlying problems in the economy and depending on how fast that comes back andor if the government keeps providing stimulus itll tell us how much of that capital we need in the first place and secondly what the opportunities will be to deploy it so were going to be patient the strategy of trying to pursue banklike acquisitions to help us expand our national franchise remains the same john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey rob i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the nuance within the fee income guide for the third quarter it sounds like the robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co the core fees that you guide to are pretty stable but maybe just sort of the puts and takes and then some how i guess maybe a retrospective i guess on how some of those activitybased fees came in relative to what you guys would have thought and how they trended through the quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think ill answer it sort of backwards there i think in retrospect i think it largely came in as we expected softer on the consumer side which we did expect as a function of the lower activity as well as fee waivers corporate services was actually pretty strong down a little bit but some good activity there that might have been a little better than what we expected and then asset management and mortgage both came in with expectations asset management relatively flat mortgage up a bit in terms of production we had that lapped that large rmsr gain in the first quarter so we were down quarteroverquarter but production levels were up so id in retrospect they came in as we expected going forward in terms of stable for the third quarter and again you know scott its fluid so visibility is low the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but id expect consumer services actually to pick up a little bit corporate services maybe to fall off a little bit and asset management and residential mortgage essentially stable r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and again thats with the caveat of the environment and how much consumer activity actually happens r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co and then to switch gears ph bill on the reserve this may end up being totally premature given how fluid this situation is but if you guys are right in your assumptions and theres no need for additional reserve build how does provisioning then traject like at what point or how much clarity does one need in a cecl world before like you start drawing down the reserve how does that kind of stuff work in this newer reserving world robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well bill may want to chime in too youre getting ahead of ourselves there a little bit in terms of r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc how we positioned it now but its going to be a function of the models obviously which well continue to run through the balance of the year and next year and at some point when those just by definition when those the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 scenarios improve provided that you didnt need the reserves for chargeoffs youd start to release thats just cecl definition r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah yeah okay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ph i mean mechanically if all else holds true on assumptions that you roll down and burn off the reserve with your chargeoffs and you add life of the loan reserves for whatever new loans come on robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and in effect youd be adding provision for new loans and everything else would solve to zero if everything else held equal which it most certainly wont robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co right robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and i think the distinction just is in terms of the components of the calculation which our portfolio changes which incorporate the levels of loans and then the economic assumptions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect and if i can sneak just one final one and just so im certain im on the right page the blackrock gain just for the purposes of the dividend or excuse me the earnings deficiency test thats now part of the ccar rules there is nothing that like disqualifies that gain right like it counts in your trailing month robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes it qualifies yes yes the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay wonderful perfect all right thank you very much robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure operator operator instructions next question comes from the line of erika najarian bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning my first question is for you bill so one of your peers jamie dimon said something yesterday that really struck me in that he said dont count out buybacks for the fourth quarter and given that we dont have any of the information in terms of capital plans beyond the third quarter and given that you have a significant amount of capital even if the severely adverse scenario becomes your base case i am wondering what your view is in terms of balancing buyback activity nearterm when its more allowable to do so versus just keeping the powder dry for that opportunity william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc first of all if we get into an environment where somehow buybacks are allowed in the fourth quarter im not sure where he was going with that in terms of maybe hes hearing something from the fed im not but ignoring that just assume that there were no restrictions at the moment for the fed i continue to believe that we are going to see opportunities both organic and inorganic in this environment to deploy that capital in a very shareholder friendly way at the margin would we use some of our capital to support our share price of course we would but that would be valuedependent and it would be also dependent on the environment that were operating in and whether or not we saw confirmation of our belief that therell be opportunities or not so its well see youve heard me use the phrase over and over again that well be rational stewards of your capital robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc that hasnt changed william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and that hasnt changed yeah erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and as a followup the one thing that also struck me in the quarter is the amount of cash on your balance sheet aside from the blackrock proceeds obviously the deposit growth has been significant and rob im wondering as you think about your revenue guide for the rest of the year what do you assume in terms of the deployment of that cash the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey erika so we will put some of that to work tactically we wont put all of it to work obviously and given particularly in terms of securities yields its pretty hard to make up a lot of revenue deploying that so were going to run with some pretty high cash balances through the balance of the year but as far as securities deployment loan loan balances thats all factored into our guidance erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys a big picture question for you bill just ex the blackrock sale the business returns to more of a traditional regional banking look in your wheelhouse and im just wondering as you think about whether its roa roe potential longterm efficiency ratio how do you now just think if any differently just about the structure of the company the business mix and where you want to head from here longterm william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont know that we necessarily think differently about it strategically weve had a focus and well continue a focus through time on organic growth of our consumer lending balances is we simply try to penetrate existing clients and then to the extent we acquire clients the same thing our business model is basically built on our ability to go to new markets and profitably build share not just through lending but through heavy crosssell and to fund that through our national digital expansion so its less of a focus on do i need to somehow change the mix of what were doing as opposed to can we accelerate the actual growth of what were doing in the environment that were in and coming into and our belief is that well be able to do that inside of that as we look at different opportunities might things change at the margin sure but its not by design its basically to take what we have and grow it even faster than we have historically ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and as a followup to that and then the prior questions theres the needs versus wants when people think about the potential inorganic strategies when you think about the franchise and to your point earlier about moving towards consumer has been a strategy for a bit are there things that you just either like to have or think you need to have to still have like the full complement or is it more just going to be about whats opportunistically out there and whats financial as much as it is strategic the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc there is nothing on the list that we think we need to have that we dont have we want to take our existing products and services and gotomarket strategy and do that in more markets this issue of something financial versus strategic the issue of and wed obviously look at both the issue of doing a purely financial transaction is one of does it cause us to take our eye off the ball in terms of our longterm growth potential it doesnt mean we wouldnt do it and what we would do with financial proceeds is accelerate organic growth but ideally wed find something thats both very financially attractive and matches our strategic agenda of expanding our geography ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah all right understood thanks bill william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator next question comes from the line of matt oconnor deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning sticking somewhat on the theme here of what youll do with the excess capital i guess to frame the question and by the way i agree that were still early and lots to still play out but how do you know if the opportunity that youre looking for wont be there and then kind of like whats plan b right like the hope is therell be something interesting strategically and financially beneficial and youll know it when its there and i think the investors and analysts trust you guys to do the right thing there but if that doesnt arrive when do you kind of capitulate and say lets go to plan b and maybe rates are higher and you can buy some securities or you buy back stock like whats the thought process there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the thought process matt is this will sound a little bit wrong but to make that decision or worry about that if in fact we get into that environment at the moment were in the middle of an environment where we i think mike corbat said this yesterday that theres more we dont know than we do it is really unclear what the longterm damage is going to be to the economy and how long its going to take to grow back and our focus right now is to make sure we have in jamies words a fortress balance sheet that were serving our customers that were opportunistic inside of what is a fairly strange environment at the moment and well sit and watch and if all of that changes then of course well change and replan and regroup and refocus and so forth but today none of that has changed robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so we continue the course and i know you guys want to sort of somehow drive us into a corner that says if the following three things happen then are you going to do a b or c and my brain cant do that math so were not going to go down that path matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc fair enough and then just maybe robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i would just add to that were fairly confident that an opportunity will arise and if it does well do it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then maybe in the meantime and from an organic perspective it still seems like theres a couple of areas that you could spend a little bit to try and grow i know mortgage has been kind of a frustrating area over the years but theres been some dislocation in the industry from peers that still seems like an area that you could be bigger capital markets you have bulked up and you saw some of that strength first half this year but obviously at really big kind of mega banks theyre getting the benefit in trading and investment banking from this unusual environment william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so just thoughts on kind of organically or from the bolton deals that youve done in the past focusing in those two areas william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look i wouldnt rule anything out neither of those necessarily fit the longer term strategic issues were facing but mortgage is an interesting question because weve clearly seen some stress in the im going to say the non capitalized mortgage players and to the extent that becomes a structural change in the industry which would in turn cause mortgage itself to be more profitable for banks matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 right yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc then we could look to grow that at the moment the structural challenges with the mortgage business as you know the costs to comply with various regulations coupled with the capacity in the market just make it difficult to make money now of course were in another refi boom and all that looks good at the moment but longterm thats not necessarily true if that changes andor if the government agency model changes such that you have to deploy capital to be in the mortgage business then that could be attractive the capital markets business we purposefully have been careful in picking our spots in that that is a business that in my experience returns more to employees than it necessarily does to shareholders through the cycle and offers lower returns on capital through the cycle but maybe with some of the changes in volcker and the opportunities were clearly seeing just in the ability to in effect broker trades and the margins in that maybe we would expand them but we can do that organically we wouldnt need to at all purchase something to do that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you operator next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill can you share with us theres been a number of conflicting economic reports this morning we see the empire manufacturing index turn positive for the first time since february industrial production came in better than expected william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc but then we look at the initial unemployment claims numbers and theyre extremely high when you talk to your business customers not so much the leisure or the restaurant type of customers but when you talk to your core customers what are they telling you about what theyre seeing in their businesses today the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well basically everybody is bluntly struggling nobody can figure out why the stock market is where it is and everybody at the margin unless youre directly volume impacted for whatever reason by covid in a positive way everybody is basically off so industrial production comes back but its still down yearonyear so and positive readings are positive readings from what was a really negative number the struggle im personally having with a lot of the data is i watch continuing claims they published a number of million plus or minus people but theres million people getting unemployment benefits today right because of the cares act special provision that allows sole proprietors and gig workers to get unemployment so with million people getting unemployment out of million us workers yet were saying the unemployment rate is only whatever theyre quoting today i cant connect the dots i see the dollars that are coming in to our deposit balances and you see it from unemployment claims which are causing our retail customers who are receiving unemployment on average to have higher balances than they had when they were employed which is in turn driving consumer spending and part of this economy robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and so jamie went on this rant and hes exactly right we see consumers flush with cash we see no delinquencies we see consumer spending increasing and its all at the moment based on government writing a check and i just dont know how this plays out but the generic corporate client we talk to whos otherwise open and doing business is almost without exception down from what they would have expected going into the year and down from where they were last year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah for sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and rob and you may have touched on this in your presentation and i may have missed it in slide when you gave us the numbers on the forbearance or what you do in robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc helping your customers and providing relief can you share with us any color on the requests for forbearance i assume theyre coming down from the peaks probably in early april and how do you see that going forward the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah no i did cover that gerard so compared to the peak were down which was midapril were down in terms of new requests so our expectation is again all things remaining equal that new requests would be pretty minimal but now as bill mentioned things are fluid william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and the other thing is were just now coming off of the period of the initial requests and so its frankly too early to really tell how many of those customers are going to ask for extension versus going back to their normal payment plans robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and i covered that as well william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the payments that were made in the last days on a percentage basis are pretty high so that would suggest possibly lower modifications going forward william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but its just too early gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc if i may on the requests for people that are in some sort of forbearance when they come back to you is it an automatic approval or do you have a process in place where you actually look at the customer and say hmm this one doesnt look like its theyre going make it were going to put it into nonaccrual how does that process work on the people that come back william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we have a the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc for a second william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we have a pretty detailed treatment plan that looks amongst other things just the cash flow available to them from the balances we see and so forth and well work to come up with something that makes sense for the client its different the second time around than it was in the initial requests where effectively you just say fine and move on to the next phone call robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so were doing them casebycase gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator next question comes from the line of john mcdonald autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey good morning rob i wanted to ask you about the fullyear guidance and robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research understanding what you said theres a lot of uncertainty in the environment just first on the basis is this on a continuing ops basis so we should think of it as kind of revenues and expenses ex blackrock in and ex blackrock in is that how were thinking of it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah thats right john thats exactly right blackrock discontinued operations and removed from that guidance john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay so just kind of pnc robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so indiscernible john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah pnc thats right john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then im not sure if you mentioned this but is it fair to us to expect like within reason obviously because its a range down to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research that youll manage within reason to shoot for positive operating leverage like if revenues are down youll try to get expenses down again within reason is that something youre shooting for and should we think about that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 oh sure sure absolutely within reason yeah hey were pleased actually given everything thats happened in the first half of the year that we have actually generated positive operating leverage but the back half continues in this state of sort of unknown variables so weve dialed it in the message that i want to send is that were very conscious and deliberate and disciplined around our expense management and well work hard this suggests somewhere flat operating leverage maybe we can do a little better than that to your point but that remains to be seen john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay okay and then on the deposit service charges you mentioned this a bit just wanted to drill down could we get any sense of how much of that decline in deposit service charge was due to fee forgiveness versus just kind of lower incidence and activity levels bill mentioned consumers being flushed with cash and then us bank said this morning they expect theirs to bounce back a bit in the third quarter still be down yearoveryear robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research do you expect a similar kind of trend and maybe just flesh it out robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah no we do and id say just rough rule of thumb about in the waivers and as reduced activity and i do expect it to come back not necessarily back to all those precorona levels but up off of second quarter levels john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research in the third quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and thats part of my guidance yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research for the flat kind of core fee revenue in the third quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah core fee revenues stable up on consumer to that point probably down a bit on corporate services just reflecting lower activity and then asset management and residential mortgage stable john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator next question comes from the line of brent erensel with portales partners please go ahead brent erensel q analyst portales partners brent erensel thank you its great to have a war chest during a pandemic i have two specific questions on the national digital effort and the national midmarket effort are these actually moving the needle in terms of the revenue wall that you and other regional banks are hitting and then the second question would be on what youre seeing in midland and the mbs commercial mbs experience if you could update us on that thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah well just on moving the needle on revenues and ill let rob throw some figures at you in a second but the ci space where we have been at this for a number of years its starting to become a meaningful part of the total revenue inside of our cib franchise and its growing at a much faster pace than our legacy markets including fees were maintaining the crosssell ratios that we had in our legacy markets the retail effort in terms of profitability at this point is probably a drain almost certainly a drain but it is affording us the ability longterm to be able to fund the growth in our cib expansion with core deposits as we build out our retail franchise collectively its profitable i dont know indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the only thing that i would add to that is that yeah the expansion markets in cib are doing quite well one question we get is whats the progress on the opening of seattle and portland which we had teed up for this year we have in fact hired there its a little bit slower than what we had planned for but were growing and each of those markets contributed significantly in terms of the line draws that we saw and the loan growth that weve seen the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah on midland loan servicing i think were the largest or close to it of robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah one of the largest william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc servicers in the cmbs market both on the master servicing side and importantly on the special servicing side thus far we have seen as much as billion a week i think the number is plus or minus robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc rolling into special servicing out of a balance but we actually have a little over billion in special servicing about billion of that is pure cmbs and our guys would tell you that in the crisis we saw billion move to special servicing theyre expecting as much as billion through this robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and were a little less than half of that indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah were half of that now that is and as an aside thats obviously those arent our assets we are paid money to service those we get paid a fee stream when they move into special servicing we get paid a very nice interest stream when we advance on principal and interest and ultimately we also get paid on resolution of those assets another fee stream so its large its accelerating and its profitable bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc just to clarify were the designated special servicer on billion of i think you said we had billion william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc oh yeah sorry were designated ph specialists we do it for others ph with our cash robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 brent erensel q analyst portales partners so youre profiting youre enjoying unusual profitability from this did you do this years ago as well william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah brent erensel q analyst portales partners excellent okay thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question so i was hoping you could help me get a better sense of what the order of magnitude is in terms of how much ppp fees can actually help your net interest income and how much is sort of baked into your outlook because you have about billion of loans and it may not help you as much as some other regional banks but certainly not chump change and if we do assume that a sizable proportion of that is forgiven and if i just run to and i dont know if thats the right number and a fee on that were talking about a few hundred millions of dollars accrued over or recognized over a few quarters so i want to get a sense as to whether you think my intuition and i guess my estimates are right first of all and then second of all rob i dont know if youve given or youve estimated or sorry provided numbers or how much is incorporated into your revenue guidance for the fullyear and your nii guidance for the third quarter i dont know if you can give any sense as to the numbers there robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah so one it is built into my fullyear revenue guidance in terms of the ppp fees most of that in terms of what im thinking about right now would be in the fourth quarter so not so much in the third quarter and then i think the issue is to what extent maybe some of that goes into so its a real number but in the context of our total nii for the year its not hugely material saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 yeah its not hugely material but if were talking about hundreds of millions of dollars it certainly moves the needle in a given quarter or even in a half a year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc but is that am i thinking about it correctly in terms of what percentage could be forgiven i know theres huge uncertainty around that but were talking about hundreds of millions of dollars here in revenue that will be collected over the next three or recognized sorry over the next three quarters robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think thats right and like i said thats built into my guidance saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it all right okay thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator next question comes from the line of brian klock with keefe bruyette woods please go ahead brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 so rob i have a question for you on credit and i wanted to i guess at first im actually more of a bourbon fan than single malt but robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i was waiting for that to come up a little sooner but i understand yeah brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its oclock somewhere i think robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right right brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc but really i guess table shows i guess that one single mall reit thats in the ph npa formation william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc right yeah brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ph you almost got it there but can you talk about the criticized trends in the commercial book i guess quarteroverquarter i guess just thinking about it with some of the forbearance and those kind of things you dont necessarily see it in the past dues so i guess i was wondering where the overall criticized commercial loan trends were quarteroverquarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah no so its up i would say sort of midteens we will report that in terms of our reports but criticized are up ph as we expected william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but one way to look at that is i dont remember the exact breakdown but when rob went through the reasons for the increase in our provision both economic and then specific credit that million plus or minus robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph million the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc was effectively the result of downgrades of credit so you can think about that population thats been affected here as being covered by the downgrades that gave rise to that 500plusorminus million brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it got it that helps that helps and then i guess maybe robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and i just want to clarify its a single mall reit related credit brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible single mall reit exactly william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ph you need to say that fast yeah yeah brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and maybe just one real quick followup and the guidance you talked about ph core expenses and revenues and the positive operating leverage targets william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe the longer term thought bill on you guys have been able to function pretty well with your digital investment with a lot of branches that you havent reopened yet right because of the pandemic i guess is there any sort of thoughts longer term about maybe not reopening some of those and closing some of those branches even though you still have the digital or you still have the branch expansion strategy nationally but any thoughts on culling some of your end market branches william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes theres additional thought look i think and by the way that wouldnt show up in run rate nearterm because at this point itd probably cost us even dollars robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 right thats right yeah thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc to close something as it does for the savings but whats clear is consumer behavior has changed and my belief is in a lot of ways its changed permanently with this adoption to digital so well have to adjust the way we serve our clients and it is likely that that will mean less physical space brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah makes sense makes sense thanks for the time guys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure thank you bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc
