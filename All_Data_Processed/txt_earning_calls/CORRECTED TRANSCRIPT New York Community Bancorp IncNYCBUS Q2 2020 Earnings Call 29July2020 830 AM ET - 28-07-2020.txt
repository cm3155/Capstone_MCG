investor relations and thank you all for joining the management team of new york community bancorp for todays conference call todays discussion of the companys second quarter performance will be led by president and chief executive officer joseph ficalora and chief financial officer thomas cangemi together with our chief operating officer robert wann and chief accounting officer john pinto todays release includes a reconciliation of certain gaap and nongaap financial measures that maybe discussed during this conference call these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for our results prepared in accordance with gaap also certain comments made on todays conference call will contain forwardlooking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations we undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forwardlooking statements after todays call you will find more information about the risk factors that may impact the companys forwardlooking statements and financial performance in todays earnings release and in our sec filings including our annual report on this morning that the commercial piece was approximately million of the million so we have million of commercial mixed use which is where we believe may have some additional difficulties given the magnitude of the rent roll thats still in the process of reopening and when you think about that as a percentage of the portfolio thats of that book is looking for some help because these businesses were completely shut down for the most part however the ltv in that book is so its a very low leverage portfolio with a very high debt service coverage ratio upon precovid and obviously the of the revenue is coming from the ground floor and lets say for example you have a fivestory walk up theyre going to need maybe additional help down the road that theres no question thats a possibility we dont know its too soon but its just logical to assume that given as the highest percentage of the deferral is where the area of focus is matt breese q analyst stephens inc and is there additional mixed use in the multifamily portfolio thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes remember the way we categorize it is multifamily versus commercial its over percentage it goes into commercial so goes into into commercial less than that many buildings have some component of ground floor revenue thats come from commercial matt breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then just lastly could you just talk about ma in this environment you do have a currency advantage are there any discussions taking place and if so could you just talk about that a little bit and then remind us of what youre looking for in terms of geography size balance sheet profile and a partner thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc joe you want to add on that one joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 yes i think theres no escaping the fact that we have a long history of being informed as to the kinds of opportunities that the marketplace presents our currency is very wellsuited in many cases not all but in many cases our currency is very wellsuited to create accretive transactions so there are partners who have sort of dialogue so as to understand whether we do or do not and under what circumstances we might be willing to do a transaction it is part and parcel of how we look at the value creation that weve accomplished over our public life and that we intend to accomplish into the future there are no banks that weve combined with that didnt wind up having a substantially better performing currency their investment in their company paid them far more by investing with us so as you very well may imagine there were many people who are very familiar with and then im talking about not just ceos but also bankers that are very familiar with our track record and our desire to do accretive deals so you could assume that we have opportunities that are being analyzed and that there is good reason to believe that the future period will present adequate opportunity for us to execute on an accretive deal importantly we will do deals that are good for our shareholders the only reason we ever do a deal is because we believe it creates greater value for shareholders there are no deals that weve ever done that didnt create greater value for our shareholders so yes in this period and in the period which may become more difficult into the future there will be opportunities where the differential between our currency and our target currency should be sufficient to be an obvious value creation for all of us theres only one currency in a deal thats the surviving currency and every deal we have ever done has created a greater value for those that took our currency thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and matt i would just add to joes commentary that were not going to do a transaction that can take on tangible book value so thats one of our limiting factors so as you can imagine as the stock improves then we will be more desirable to do something here but given where our currency is right now as joe indicated certain transactions just cant happen because of the of the partners currency it has to be tangible indiscernible accretive thats just something that we feel very strongly about matt breese q analyst stephens inc got it i appreciate it thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning peter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i was curious how much exposure do you guys have to the exchange and the reason i ask is if joe biden were to win part of his tax plan is to eliminate the exchange tax incentive thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right so pete let me let me handle that one so obviously we do not have a exchange business but our customers do play in that space so the value creation thats been created to the new york city real estate market has been through the exchange as youre fully aware the deferral of taxation through literally generational holdings is the impetus on many players being creating more value time over time over generational holdings as they utilize the tax codes under the trump administration they locked in that exchange for real estate where other lines of businesses were excluded from that so we do not have a business that is a exchange business other banks do that business we just participate in the purchase and sales which facilitates the transaction so i will say with clarity if that does happen its not good for real estate peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc right okay peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc that is my only question that is my only thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right pete thanks i hope youre wrong by the way operator our next question is from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please proceed christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 hello thanks good morning i appreciate all the information this morning i just want to ask about the cet1 ratio under the scenario that joe was just talking about with a merger is there a lower band to where you may take that just temporarily on a closing and then obviously it would improve as youve retained earnings thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no i would say what we talked about capital is king for us we dont we have a very strong capital allocation process because we have a low risk bank but the last thing we want to do is do a transaction and take our ratios down so if we were to be successful in announcing a transaction youd assume that ratio would improve right at announcement in a closing thats clearly one of our deciding factors when were looking at combining two institutions together and improving capital position christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thats helpful and then just a quick one i know you talked a lot about asset yields but is there any relation to the history back in and when rates reset to how the asset yields held up then it just seems if they are holding up better know and maybe thats an advantage for you well beyond the current quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no its interesting that you mentioned that so obviously let me just go back to and the end of is where we had the low for longest scenario with the fed they have rates close to zero for extended period of time which is kind of where we are today and our cost of deposits was as low as basis points i think right now at a basis points on cost of deposits so we have a lot of room there on the asset side we had a much stronger asset yield because those rates are coming down from a much higher plateau the negative is that you have refi yields coming down to literally slightly less than where they were a year ago so the 320s 330s are being refinanced at so youre not getting that benefit but the cost of funds drop is significant its conceivable that we can go below the cost of deposit scenario where we are in and if the fed continues to keep their rates close to zero thats a very thats a reasonable scenario so youll make it up on the cost of funds side we have and during that period our borrowing costs are dramatically higher so we have approximately million remaining in at a million on the wholesale side and we have about a billion at and if you think the way the market is on lets say two year bullets three year bullets its basis points basis points and potentially going lower so i think that there is a the positive here is that were going to do as much as we can to get reasonable spreads we cant control the market but we will be lending but the cost of liabilities for our model is coming down significantly in a zero for longer scenario christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great tom thats helpful thank you again new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i appreciate all the guidance on the expense side i was just wondering about the lower comp expense this quarter is that where from a reduction in the workforce or lower bonus accruals or some combination of that and then if you think theres more capacity for more steps on that front the back half of the year or even next year and then maybe on the branch network what you guys can do there if anything thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc to capture some expenses there thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc let me address the comp numbers straight out because those are driven off of payroll taxes q1 is always the high quarter for the year and you have to true up social security and payroll expenses so thats the high point our payroll should be relatively consistent so what you saw last quarter should be consistent in q3 and probably q4 as far as branch opportunities were always open to looking at leases that are coming due and coming available we rather not take charge and we took one in the beginning of the year that we felt was appropriate when we looked at some of these opportunities and as they come along closer to their renewal we evaluate the profitability and we will consider that during the down the road but clearly were not looking to take additional charges for that david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 yes okay and then just one question on the end of the whole deferral process if you guys have any multifamily or commercial real estate in deferral that come off at the end of that period and they arent cash flowing and you have to call those tdrs and mark those i know you guys are really wellpositioned from an ltv basis but how do you mark those if there arent any appropriate real transaction you can use in the market at that point or if their deals going out at much lower prices because assets are coming out of structures and hitting lower bids and so what are the thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc dave youre not marking them down youre just being tdrs are tdrs i mean obviously youre correct i mean if theres no cash flow the financial wherewithal from the borrower cant support it youre going to carry them like at the ph face value david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc right thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right and david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and so there is really no good transactions going on and i mean youre obviously using transactions to figure out where you value those assets thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc is there thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc we appraise or get updated appraisals you go through that process again i think you know i would say youre more inclined to deal with that on the office and retail side and maybe the mixed use but on the multifamily side you still have you know a lot of customers here that are getting flushed with cash so youre correct thats going no one is coming out of this unscathed its going to be loans that have to be dealt with after the process goes through the multiple opportunities of giving them some relief but we dont really know exactly when that will call for us we feel very strongly that were going to have very strong statistics to discuss at the end of the year bear in mind were one quarter behind the entire banking space as we felt it prudent to give them six months relief in the epicenter of the pandemic new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 we were proved right you know i can tell you with certainty as we got into phase businesses are opening right now and the conversations like ive discussed what were having is and i dont want to pay i dont want to accrue this interest i dont want to i want to pay you so i dont have an interest accrual and thats the ongoing conversation there will be some that who have a difficult time and given the low leverage we deal with well work it out and hopefully there wont be a material number david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc have you guys set up any kind of a reserve for an interest income for some of those loans that are on deferral where you think they might not be able to come off of it successfully thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc nothing material david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then i guess just lastly what are the prospects of actually being able to extend deferrals again come october for some of those loans that are having trouble still weve heard from some banks that accounts may not allow that they might force the tdr classification but thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just curious where youre guys are gearing thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc dave id say that there is flexibility and im hoping we dont have to go there but if we do have to go there theres lots of flexibility were in a black swan pandemic event that has to be dealt with that has significant government support here so in the event a business is forced to shut down for extended period of time im assuming theres some flexibility under the cares act that they cant reopen because the government says you cant open what they did not like to open theres going to be some flexibility you know we deal with a lot of large borrowers they have a lot of large buildings that are rent regulated we also have a lot of large credits and those large credits some are uniquely positioned but some of the smaller players may have the issue of reopening and the capacity and we have to deal with that and as that comes to a point where we have to sit down and discuss the next round of deferral well deal with that but theres no question that theres flexibility and its important to note that what were hearing from the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2020 industry that therell be more flexibility coming i will tell you that all our people are sitting on a number of panels of potential clarity on how to deal with this after six months i believe by the time six months comes around youll probably have more clarity from the industry david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay sounds good thanks guys i appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i would like to turn it back over
