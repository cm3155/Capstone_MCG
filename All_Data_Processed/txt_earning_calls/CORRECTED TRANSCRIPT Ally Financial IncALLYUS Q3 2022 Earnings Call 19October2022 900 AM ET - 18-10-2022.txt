everything youve been a big part in our companys evolution so thank you ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 and with that lets go ahead and jump into the quarter ill start on page number third quarter adjusted eps of core rotce of and revenues of billion reflected another quarter of solid financial results rotce was approximately excluding the impact of oci we had several notable items impacting results this quarter and wanted to be very transparent around all the moving pieces similar to last quarter and consistent with what weve been guiding we saw a strong loan growth across the company and in particular within auto finance we certainly recognize the tightening environment but consumer credit underwriting is a core capability of our company and we believe we are generating some of the most attractive riskadjusted loans in the history of ally specifically total loans grew billion in the period driving million of provision build which i dont think was fully contemplated in street estimates we also recorded a million impairment on our investments in better mortgage company reflecting the conditions affecting the broader mortgage industry following the impairment our investment has a remaining carrying value of million so this has been effectively derisked within operating expenses we recorded a million charge associated with the termination of our legacy pension plan we expect an additional impact of around million within operating expenses and additional tax expense as we complete the termination in the fourth quarter the annuity was purchased earlier in october so this expense is certain at this point going forward ally has no remaining exposure to qualified pension plans given the unique nature of the pension item the impacts are reflected in gaap results but removed from adjusted metrics and we recorded a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits which resulted in a million increase in tax expense for the quarter we expect these items will be nonrecurring in nature with the exception of the loan growth provision build it was a bit of a noisy quarter so we thought it would be helpful to hit these notable items at once before getting into the details on the quarter lets turn to page number and discuss operational performance within auto consumer originations of billion were flat to the third quarter in the prior year and about billion lower than the second quarter originated yields expanded basis points quarteroverquarter to industry vehicle sales remained pressure but our ability to generate strong consumer originations shows the scale of our auto finance business and depth of application flow one other observation i would make youve heard other ceos make comments about pulling back from segments of the auto finance market i think you need to look closely as to what is really happening prime lending continues to be a very solid space superprime lending has seen very aggressive pricing from the credit unions it makes sense that some banks dont want to chase that the subprime market has shrunk from about of the origination universe to this is a function of a lack of availability for lower priced units and that has indirectly impacted some banks ability to originate there again prime continues to perform quite well but obviously this is where deep experience people and relationships matter and further contrary to what you also may have read about happening in the prime space we actually observed some of our competitors lowering price in the quarter to try to capture volume on commercial loans we saw modest increases in new inventory levels across the marketplace but balances remain low and we continue to expect a prolonged normalization we recently surpassed million total vehicles sold on our smartauction platform weve not typically highlighted smartauction very often externally but its a great example of how weve continued to evolve our product offerings to create value for ally and our dealer customers ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 within insurance written premiums of million were impacted by lower inventory levels and industry sales investment portfolio performance remained solid but constrained by the overall market performance turning to ally bank retail deposit customers exceeded million expanding yearoveryear and representing our 54th consecutive quarter of customer growth as we conveyed on the last quarters call retail balance growth resumed with balances increasing billion in the quarter deposits currently represent of funding and we are seeing a very competitive market and larger flows to brokerage to start the fourth quarter our consumer engagement and product adoption trends remain compelling ally home originations of million in the quarter reflects broader market conditions equity market trends resulted in a decline in ally invest assets while accounts increased versus prior year ally lending generated origination volume of nearly million with expansion from our healthcare and home improvement verticals ally credit card reached billion of loan balances and we surpassed million active cardholders and corporate finance continues to generate solid loan growth with the heldforinvestment portfolio reaching billion lets turn to slide number to discuss the consumer like all lenders and especially given the uncertainty in the market we are extremely focused on consumer health and continue to look for any early indicators of potential consumer stress while persistent inflation remains a clear headwind we continue to see strong balance sheets across our consumers on the bottom left savings account balances at ally bank remain elevated relative to prepandemic levels weve included a view based on income level but we look at this data across multiple dimensions and the trends look consistent across occupation vintage and balance cohorts the right side of the page shows average consumer debit spend weve seen slight moderation from earlier this year and spend remains up versus prepandemic levels broader financial obligations for consumers remain near record lows enabling these spend levels while still maintaining elevated savings balances at this stage indicators remain solid and will remain nimble and react accordingly as the market evolves id also add that within all of our lending portfolios weve been making tactical adjustments and tweaks to our underwriting trends this is often overshadowed by the headline numbers but there is a tremendous amount of granular focus when we deploy credit and capital finally employment remains very tight and should buoy strongerthanexpected credit performance relative to historical norms so netnet we still see a strong and wellpositioned consumer and the portfolio seasoning largely in line with expectations at this point and with that brad over to you for more of the details bradley brown corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb good morning everyone ill begin with detailed results for the quarter on slide net financing revenue excluding oid of billion grew nearly million or yearoveryear performance was driven by continued strength in origination volumes and auto pricing higher funding costs given the rapid increase in ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 shortterm rates partially offset through our hedging position growth in unsecured consumer products and gradual normalization of excess liquidity over the past year adjusted other revenue of million reflected solid performance across our insurance smartauction and consumer banking businesses revenues declined versus the prior year and prior quarter driven by impairment of our investment in better mortgage that jb covered excluding the impact of that impairment other revenue was consistent with our mid expectations provision expense of million reflected origination volume and the continued normalization of credit performance loan growth across retail auto unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance drove a million reserve build while cecl provisioning is a headwind for the current period strong originations will drive attractive longterm returns net chargeoffs in the period of million remained below prepandemic levels while up versus the prior year the increase remains in line with expectations noninterest expense of billion reflects continued investment in technology and higher personnel expense as a reminder the prior period did not include any expenses related to ally credit card as jb mentioned the quarter also included million of costs associated with the termination of our legacy pension plan within tax expense results reflect a nonrecurring valuation adjustment jb covered these adjustments increased the tax rate in the quarter by approximately percentage points gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of increased basis points yearoveryear and declined basis points quarteroverquarter given duration dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet we expect to see some nearterm pressure but remain confident in an upper nim over time we built a structurally enhanced balance sheet over several years but faced some temporary pressure from the unprecedented pace and magnitude of the increases in the shortterm interest rates total loans and leases are up nearly billion versus prior year while the normalization of excess liquidity results in total operating earning asset growth of billion earning asset yield of grew basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting the benefits of strong originated yields within retail auto growth in higher yielding assets and more than billion of floating rate exposure across the loan and hedging portfolios retail auto portfolio yield expanded basis points from the prior quarter to the figure weve alluded to previously we expect continued yield expansion due to the gradual decline in prepayment headwinds which we started to see in recent months continued expansion in originated yield above and our hedging position which added basis points to the retail portfolio yield this quarter as mentioned previously yields expanded across our commercial and credit card portfolios as their floating nature benefits from the higher rates looking forward we expect continued earning asset yield expansion fueled by strong pricing in auto finance continued disciplined growth across our newer consumer portfolios and the benefit of higher interest rates turning to liabilities cost of funds increased basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearover year the increase in deposit costs reflects higher benchmark rates and a competitive direct bank market for deposits ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 broadly speaking funding costs will continue to move higher as the fed continues with the tightening cycle but we remain confident in our ability to manage interest expense due to our customer value proposition that goes beyond rate core funded status and flexibility across diverse funding sources for the next couple of quarters the rapid increase in benchmark rates will pressure margins as deposits initially repriced faster than earning assets ill cover these dynamics in detail on the next slide slide provides detail on the drivers of nearterm pressure on net interest margin and our expectations over the coming quarters with fixed rate retail auto as a largest asset on our balance sheet and liquid savings making up of the deposit portfolio we manage a naturally liabilitysensitive balance sheet in retail auto we put basis points of pricing to the market through september and basis points total through last weekend on the deposit side our osa pricing moved basis points as of september and basis points as of today the pricing on the retail auto is to basis points in excess of what weve done on osa so far while beta on both sides has been in line with or favorable to our original expectations because of the timing dynamics we discussed previously increases in the retail auto portfolio yield lag increases in deposits that will continue to be the case for the next couple of quarters as the fed is expected to move rates higher but over time the retail auto portfolio will continue to migrate towards the originated yield which we expect to move well into on the deposit side the osa rate will move higher but should level off once we get to a peak level of fed funds we provided a lot of detail on retail auto and deposits given their size but keep in mind most of our commercial book is floating rate and weve talked about billion to billion of growth in unsecured lending in the medium term given their high margins that growth should add basis points to consolidated nim over time so putting all that together we expect nim to bottom around basis points before we level off and eventually move higher while we recognize there is focus on the trajectory having nim in the mid when rates are expected to go up almost basis points in nine months is a reflection of the leading franchises and strong balance sheet weve built over the past several years lastly on nim weve added additional detail on the retail auto pay fixed hedge position in the appendix turning to slide our cet1 ratio declined to as earnings supported billion in rwa growth and million in share repurchases last week we announced a dividend of per share and have completed approximately billion in repurchases on a yeartodate basis through september while we maintain very robust capital levels with billion of excess above scb requirements given the heightened macroeconomic uncertainty we do not expect material share repurchases in the fourth quarter our priorities remain focused on maintaining prudent capital levels amid continued uncertainty while simultaneously investing in the growth of our businesses lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points continued to normalize in line with the expectations comparisons to the prior year and prepandemic periods are influenced by the addition of unsecured lending and a corporate finance chargeoff that added basis points to the consolidated rate and was reserved for in unsecured lending adds an incremental basis points retail auto performance continued to reflect a gradual normalization strong used values continue to benefit loss given default rates and the normalization of peak values is consistent with our expectations in the bottom right 30day delinquencies increased due to typical seasonality and a gradual normalization of consumer trends but remained below 60day delinquencies are equal to but we continue to see favorable flow to loss rates helping to keep chargeoffs below levels we expect continued increases in ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 delinquencies as consumer trends normalize postpandemic and we are closely monitoring additional inflationary pressures on slide we wanted to provide some additional perspective on the risk profile of the retail auto portfolio that should be helpful as you think about normalization of losses and delinquencies relative to our portfolio today has slightly more risk content based on our strategic shift to the intersection of prime and used several years ago we began focusing more heavily on the used market and reducing our concentration in superprime which generally has lower returns since making that strategic shift weve maintained a disciplined underwriting approach our portfolio has gradually seasoned over that time and now reflects loss content consistent with our normalized loss expectations as pandemic tailwinds normalize we expect delinquencies and net chargeoffs to migrate above levels we expect normalized delinquencies of to versus in and we expect losses to migrate towards which is basis points higher than to compensate for that incremental loss content weve added basis points of price since normalizing for benchmark rate moves weve added basis points of price to compensate for the basis points of higher expected losses and as youve heard from us in the past the investments weve made in talent and digital tools have enhanced our servicing and collections capabilities and give us confidence in our ability to effectively manage credit in a variety of environments on slide consolidated coverage increased basis points to reflecting growth in our retail auto unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance portfolios the total reserve increased to billion or billion higher than cecl day levels retail auto coverage of increased basis points and is basis points higher than cecl day this includes an overlay of million or roughly basis points for potential losses tied to hurricane ian weve demonstrated an ability to navigate these weather events focusing on supporting our customers and minimizing financial impacts under our cecl methodology our 12month reasonable and supportable period assumes unemployment increasing to slightly above over the next months before it gradually reverse into a historical mean of about moving to ally bank on slide retail deposits of billion increased billion quarteroverquarter as growth resumed following elevated tax outflows in the prior period inflows from traditional banks represent the majority of growth and supports our core assumption that direct banks will become increasingly attractive as the gap between traditional and direct banks widens across the industry online savings rates eclipsed in september and we saw our highest monthly growth since march of total deposit balances increased billion quarteroverquarter driven by incremental growth from broker deposits we continue to expect modest retail deposit growth for the full year we delivered strong customer growth adding new customers in q3 our 54th consecutive quarter of growth since we founded ally bank balanced growth and retention have been foundational aspects of our retail deposit strategy along with customer acquisition the bottom right demonstrates a consistent trend of growth from both new and existing customers and we continue to lead the industry with a retention rate and we operate the deposits business for less than basis points of noninterest expense a significant advantage as we think about total cost of deposits and overall efficiency ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 turning to slide we continue to drive scale and diversification across our digital bank platforms deposits continue to serve as the primary gateway to our other banking products which enhance brand loyalty drive engagement and deepen customer relationships leveraging the strength of our brand allows us to build on current momentum across newer consumer lending products ally invest continues to increase depth and strength of customer relationships at ally bank customers who have deposit and invest relationships have nearly two times higher balances and are less likely to attrite than stand alone deposit customers card balances of billion are derived from million active customers reflecting our disciplined strategy of low and grow credit lines ally lending balances of billion are more than two times prior year levels given momentum across healthcare and home improvement verticals well continue to be deliberate to see meaningful opportunities for accretive growth across these newer businesses and are excited for the capabilities were building for the future lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was driven by growth in retail auto balances as well as yield and solid credit performance the increase in provision expense versus prior periods resulted from normalizing credit performance and cecl reserve build to support billion in consumer originations with attractive riskadjusted returns looking at the bottom left originated yield of was up basis points from the prior quarter reflecting significant pricing actions we put more than basis points of price into the market through last week and despite seasonality headwinds we expect to originate above in the fourth quarter as elevated retail trading activity normalizes and reduces pressure on portfolio yield we continue to expect that portfolio will migrate well into the given current originated yields pricing beta should be viewed through the tightening cycle but weve been pleased with the momentum todate and remain confident in our ability to generate higher yields from here turning to slide our leading agile platform is built to adapt to dealer and customer needs in a comprehensive manner reflected in our performance and the multiyear growth of our dealers we are now approaching active dealer relationships up over the past three years our strategy remains centered on deepening these relationships and increasing application flow in the upper right ending consumer assets expanded to billion or nearly on a yearoveryear basis retail auto assets increased billion in the quarter based on current market conditions we expect more than billion of consumer originations in commercial balances ended at billion as new vehicle supply remains pressured turning to origination trends in the bottom half of the page auto volume of billion displays our ability to generate strong flow while adding significant price in the market used accounted for of originations continuing to display our flexibility to adapt to market conditions while nonprime comprised of volume consistent with our trend over the past few years weve remained disciplined and leveraging a deliberate approach to underwriting and entrenched dealer relationships to drive strong flows we are cognizant of the uncertainty on the horizon and remain focused on optimizing the buybox and pricing to ensure appropriate riskadjusted returns turning to insurance results on slide core pretax income of million decreased yearoveryear from the impact of lower investment gains given the market backdrop total written premiums of million reflect a ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 continued focus on increasing dealer engagement while still facing a headwind from lower unit sales and inventory levels across the industry on the bottom left we wanted to provide a realtime example of how we navigate potential loss events in ways that benefit our dealer customers and mitigate risk for ally hurricane ian was a significant storm with industry insurance industry estimates calling for losses in excess of billion from an ally perspective we had over billion of floorplan exposure in the storms path and were able to limit expected losses to less than million through proactive outreach we continue to look for ways to differentiate our product offerings and remain a partner for our dealers as these weather events occur and disrupt their operations going forward we remain focused on leveraging our significant dealer network and holistic offerings to drive further integration of insurance across auto finance turning to corporate finance on slide core income of million reflected disciplined growth in the loan portfolio a year over increase a yearoveryear increase in other revenue from a gain related to a previously restructured loan exposure and stable credit trends net financing revenue was impacted by higher asset balances as well as higher benchmarks as the entire portfolio is floating rate the loan portfolio remains diversified across industries with assetbased loans comprising of the portfolio our billion hfi portfolio is up yearoveryear reflecting our expertise and disciplined growth within a highly competitive market mortgage details are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of dtc originations reflecting tighter margins and conforming production and effectively zero demand for refinancing activity mortgage remains a key product for our customers who value a modern and seamless digital platform rather than focusing on volume we remain committed to delivering a great experience for our bank customers and compelling riskadjusted returns which may lead to fluctuations in origination levels over the coming quarters lastly on mortgage we provided some detail on our investment in better referenced by jb the investment has a remaining carry value of million and generated gains in excess of the original investment so despite the impairment this quarter the investment has been accretive to capital ill close by emphasizing my confidence in ally and our ability to successfully navigate a variety of economic environments im excited to lead this transition and would like to thank jenn for her leadership over the past five years and wish her the very best and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you brad slide number provides a view of the macro environment were navigating how we are delivering operationally and how we are positioning for further uncertainties as we covered throughout todays call operational performance remains solid and im proud of our teams for focusing on controlling what we can control obviously the macro backdrop is constantly evolving as a natural liabilitysensitive balance sheet the short term faces more pressures but fundamentals remain very sound based on current forwards the fed funds rate is expected to increase basis points this year the most since vehicle sales remain pressured with supply chain and production challenges yet to be fully resolved despite these factors weve continued to generate attractive loan growth and deposit growth is down across the ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 industry given the onset of quantitative tapering and elevated tax payments in the first half of the year our teams have shown their ability to remain nimble pivot as needed and continue to deliver operationally full year auto originations are expected to be around billion on the deposit side our digital direct bank model continues to resonate in the market weve seen steady growth in customers throughout the year and despite new competitive forces we still expect to generate modest full year growth credit is performing in line with our expectations consolidated chargeoffs remain under basis points given the strength of our largely secured balance sheet in addition to solid execution weve positioned the company for a variety of economic environments reserve levels remain approximately billion higher than cecl day and have nearly tripled since capital levels are billion above our scb requirement and again yields on our more newly originated auto book are now well north of and continuing to increase which provides significant loss absorption capacity even in periods of elevated losses were disciplined on underwriting and are constantly refining the buybox to ensure we appropriately size and price for risk and weve made meaningful investments in people and digital capabilities across our customer servicing and collections teams so while the macro path from here remains uncertain we have great businesses with seasoned operators and an incredible culture over the last decade we have transformed all aspects of our company and were better positioned than ever to navigate a challenging environment well stay focused on executing our strategic priorities for longterm value creation given the environment we did want to share a snapshot of the fourth quarter the outlook particularly in the near term remains fluid but as we sit here today we see nim around that reflects the nearterm pressure weve highlighted today retail yields and hedge income will be up meaningfully quarteroverquarter but is not expected to fully offset elevated funding costs in the short term and depending on the shape of the curve and the path of fed funds rate we could be here for several quarters we see billion to billion of loan growth expected in the fourth quarter across our consumer and corporate finance portfolios so reserves will increase as we grow the balance sheet continued normalization of credit including seasonal patterns will result in consolidated credit losses around basis points and putting it all together adjusted eps is expected to be around per share in the fourth quarter ill provide an update at the goldman sachs conference later this quarter and consistent with prior years well give you our insights into the roe guide weve had out there is again a throughthecycle view and we believe largely remains intact but obviously the dramatic acceleration in interest rates put some pressure on the nearterm outlook finally ill close with a few comments on slide number i remain incredibly proud to lead our company allys purposedriven culture is genuine and fuels our financial and operational performance as youve heard us say were focused on delivering performance for all of our stakeholders whether its teammates customers communities or stockholders as we enter a period of uncertainty i continue to challenge our teammates to see around corners focus on essentialism and adopt an onerous mindset allys results and marketleading businesses demonstrate we are equipped to successfully navigate in challenging environments we will remain focused nimble operators and ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 disciplined on capital deployment which im confident will drive longterm value i know this quarter didnt hit expectations but fundamentals remain really solid and i hope the added transparency today gives you more of a detailed view on the various dynamics we are navigating and with that sean lets head into qa sean leary headinvestor relations ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one followup carmen please begin the qa question and answer section operator thank you one moment operator instructions one moment for our first question the first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc to start off i dont know if jenns still on the call but i just want to say jenn its been a pleasure working with you and obviously best of luck in your new role jb maybe to start on credit implies a little bit of a ramp in chargeoffs and youve given us some color both on the delinquencies and where you see chargeoffs going i guess could you maybe just talk about when you think these will begin to level off and i asked a similar question last quarter the guide implies about billion originations for the fourth quarter and just given market concerns why not slow the originations a bit more given and sit and see what happens with credit and the economy and take a more conservative approach given particularly maybe some of the newer businesses in addition to what youre seeing in auto jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah got it ryan thanks for the question so first leveling off on chargeoffs obviously as we talked about throughout todays call its a pretty fluid environment so hard necessarily to predict exactly i mean we think mid maybe the backside of you should start to see some stabilization there but some of this is obviously dependent on how far the fed goes whether we can get inflation broadly speaking from a macro economy under control and i think so theres a lot of unknowns at this point ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 what i would say we had out there this expected loss range of to still think thats largely intact you heard us today sort of drop the side of that and thats a bit by design i mean we see losses are going to migrate up closer to that range through time but i think tied into your second point why not pull back i mean part of this is we see still these markets being very attractive flows right now ryan i mean if we shocked funding costs to somewhere in the neighborhood of put lifetime losses on the auto book in excess of youre still getting an roe of around of new business and roa just shy of so in terms of capital deployment in terms of continuing to serve your customers we still feel really good about new loans that were originating today and it sometimes gets lost in the big numbers when you last quarter it was billion this quarter it was billion were talking about an annual number of 48ish billion we constantly trim the margins where we see incremental pockets of risk i mean the analytics behind this are very robust we have weekly credit conversations and buybox adjustments so its a very fluid environment and sometimes thats trimming million million million in a quarter but that is ongoing so where we see pockets of risk but we say we dont like that space we dial back but broadly speaking where were playing in prime its still very attractive returns are very robust and i think its important but we continue to serve our dealer customers but i think long term we really like the loans were putting on the books today and think theyre going to prove to be very profitable over time ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color and maybe as a followup if i think about the guide it implies a return thats less than exoci and obviously theres a lot of uncertainty but were not in a recession yet and i think you mentioned that the mediumterm target largely remains intact but theres going to be pressure in the near term so i guess do you expect to operate around this level of profitability for the next few quarters and i guess given the stocks trading less than of tangible exoci where do you see the returns of this company going in and what do you think it will take for us to get back to those mediumterm return levels thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean i think obviously with respect to the stock yes disappointing how its continued to trade were bottomed by but i think most of this is all priced in at this point and in fact pretty draconian scenarios are implied relative to future credit performance but i think we see ourselves youre in the neighborhood of kind of your roe in the fourth quarter we see that largely being the low point and we would gradually start to increase so the to again weve always talked about that being a throughthecycle view we still see that is being fully intact were a structurally more profitable company but i think in the near term when youre a liabilitysensitive balance sheet and you have basis points basis points of set increases embedded over a period of nine months its hard to outrun that but i mean i think the important point is at some point youll see obviously cost of deposits which are big drivers start to normalize we put some sensitivities around a beta from here and that gets you to an osa rate of in the neighborhood of 350ish whether or not we get there or not remains to be seen some of thats driven by competitive pressures so at some point that starts to normalize and your auto book starts to all these new loans they start to work their way through and netnet your portfolio yield is suddenly going to be much much higher and so we would see the exit rate in being higher and gradually growing back to the to is kind of the normalized view ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 but i think next year is probably in that to 13pluspercent range and then a couple of other drivers that brad talked about i think the newer products both on the consumer side both in credit card ally lending as well as what were doing in the corporate finance book thats pretty profitable business and you take all those things together and that should start contributing to margin expansion as well so a lot of what youre seeing in the fourth quarter when your nim goes down to basis points your charge offs are probably approaching basis points well hope well beat that number but this leads to fourth quarter kind of being a floor and its just a bit uncertain as to how quickly you rebound from there but i but hopefully you appreciate ryan all the different variables and dynamics that are at play ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc appreciate all the color jb jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thank you see you in december operator thank you one moment for our next question please our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch of credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks given that the margin i think the margin trends were somewhat kind of expected maybe a touch worse just given the fact that the fed tightening is kind of increased faster but can we talk a little bit about the credit normalization and what would make it what would require you to build the reserve to a higher level than youre currently holding at given that you said that your oneyear forecast has the unemployment rate in the and then moving back to a higher level i guess so if we think about it what would it take for that number to go to be worse than what youre currently expecting jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah so i think the first overall we feel really good about the level of coverage we have in place today obviously were up to i think a couple of basis points of that just being driven by hurricane ian but youre carrying considerable more reserves even relative to cecl day and certainly if you went all the way back to so what could cause that to change some with cecl you have some interesting factors on how cecl math works so if you got a moodys scenario that suddenly implied unemployment rates were going to meaningfully shock higher from here which again we dont necessarily think thats going to be the case you could be forced to build a bigger reserve but again i think this embedded normalization to a unemployment rates relative to where were at today we feel pretty good so we dont think thats going to transpire but as we just talked about with ryan as im sure youre talking about moshe with all your customers theres just a lot of uncertainty about how consumers are going to withstand ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 sustained inflation again what we try to convey is all the things that we see on the consumer today feel really solid but well go through our normal reserving process like we do every quarter i mean could you see coverage tick up a point here or there just from normal bau absolutely but i think for the most part we feel really good about the level of reserves that are out there and we feel were adequately protected moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay thanks and just as a followup kind of following up kind of on ryans question about kind of moderating originations i guess how do you think about it in terms of the size of the balance sheet both in terms of capital and also just funding i mean to some degree i guess i would have thought that the more rates go up given the fact that traditional retail banks havent really raised their rates very much yet that betas could be smaller not higher and yet obviously the loan growth obviously kind of drives individual companies to kind of keep them a little bit higher to make sure they have enough funding and i guess so if you think about the combination of that is that i mean i guess the question is could we start to see those betas improve before rates level off or how are you thinking about that currently jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah another great question i mean we would certainly hope so is what i would say but obviously again moshe as you know theres just been a rapid actual increase in shortterm rates and even further more projected from here youve got another basis points priced in so we think that beta would be on the high side of where we would be at from here but youre seeing a lot of competitors and a lot of competitive pressures being out there its been sort of interesting to see some of the behaviors weve observed in the fourth quarter in the direct banks and a couple of folks now paying in excess of frankly that surprised us a little bit just in terms of how aggressive some ratepayers are being right there were trying to combat that obviously we have a cash balance promo lift out there to continue attracting high quality deposits right now but it has been a very dynamic environment and then the other interesting factor id say and our teams sean and i got out sean brad and i got an update this morning even its just interesting kind of a recent outflows to brokerage which may imply your mass consumer thinking equities are close to bottoming where theyre at here and youre starting to see bigger flows into brokerage than weve seen so all that ends up to some degree pressuring how much your growth and all this just starts to be a balance of how aggressive do you want to be in terms of paying on rate but we would hope through time the beta would moderate from here and i think that again that we showed you we would believe is more a worstcase scenario than anything moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you moshe operator thank you one moment for our next question please our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions just first on the outlook for nim i know you mentioned the for and i guess i just wanted to get a sense of the pushpulls in there that would drive it either higher or lower as we go through the next couple of quarters just in terms of if the forward curve is moving up faster like a cash carry kind of rates might go higher for longer scenario and then also just wanted to understand how youre thinking about the remarketing gains that are embedded in nim how does that traject throughout the rest of this year and into next thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah you got it so i mean i think with respect to nim its largely going to be back to what your assumption is around deposit costs so similar to moshes question there its the competitive environment remains pretty intense we would hope beta at some point starts to slow there but i think thats the big driver obviously on the auto side the teams been great in terms of continuing to push pricing into the market flows have been really strong really solid again some of the most profitable loans we think weve ever originated and you heard me talk about the stat so on the auto side were continuing to push price as hard as we can there and again that just takes time for that for the entire portfolio to season to see that portfolio yield migrate up but whats going to be the nearterm story ultimately comes back to deposits and then gains about million this quarter i think we think were going to be relatively in that zip code for the next couple of quarters we dont see that being a big driver either direction here used car prices as youre seeing are starting to come off a touch obviously we saw manheim come out earlier this year all thats embedded in our guide and in our assumptions and so that could slow some of the where lessees are kind of going and capturing that gains themselves so it could be slightly additive to us but i dont think its going to be a really meaningful driver from here but i think we were down kind of and used to in the third quarter and we still in terms of pricing and we ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 obviously still had decent gains in the lease book there so its not going to be a huge driver i guess is my ultimate point betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just on the outlook for the losses on the auto book to the 16ish level im thinking through how declines in used car prices are going to be impacting that over the course of the next year or so and maybe you can give us an update on some of the partners that you have exposure to like carvana thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah sure so i mean i think declines in used car pricing is largely embedded in or are embedded in that kind of guide i mean i think still look when we underwrite loans today we still have that loss assumption of to that is consistent i think what were trying to do in our guide today is say look we recognize in light of all audio gap these macro factors were probably going to be on the upper end of the range and then part two of your question can you betsy one more time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh yeah sure just wanted to understand how your exposure is trending towards some of the partners you have like carvana jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah thank you so what i would say there obviously we are watching carvana closely we engage at my level and certainly our head of the auto business doug timmerman with ernie quite regularly about their journey here what i would say our exposure while we do have retail commitments out there there are price determinations there that allows us if we dont want the paper you can indirectly influence that by a pricing decision but for us were not lending on their real estate they its really retail exposure and i think as you know carvanas business model is effectively to sell a car and theres not really a lot of put back so in terms of retail exposure to us its the paper is performing quite well in fact i would say on a liketolike basis their credit performance performs every bit is good if not a tick better than our own auto core auto dealeroriginated paper so we feel were obviously watching them but theyve been a really good partner and obviously theyre faced with industry dynamics inflation pressures trying to align inventory to where demand is but i think ernie has done a really responsible job of kind of cleaning up operations lowering costs slowing in the growth but in terms of a retail flow partner we have no complaints whatsoever about them and consumers still like the model betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah thanks operator thank you and our final question one moment please our final question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i just had a question jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning i have a question on new origination pricing jb at the outset you talked about all the puts and takes sort of the competitive dynamics and i think brad mentioned that the yield is going to move to well in excess of im just curious do you guys see any change in sort of demand elasticity related to that you mentioned also banks are pricing lower do you feel theres any risk to that yield as we move forward jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sanjay at this point and i said on one of the questions weve been pleasantly surprised by our teams ability to put price in the market i think one other dynamic is car prices are starting to come off thats honestly thats a bigger driver in terms of a monthly payment factor relative to the absolute rate that a consumer pays and so these things are kind of working in tandem where we havent seen much pressure but i would say as were having these conversations with our auto business leader and the team i think were probably closer to not necessarily a peak but youre closer to a saturation point where you may see demand start to slow a bit where consumers just dont want to see rates in excess of call it were not bothered by that obviously were not out with our auto business setting a defined origination target again this year we think it will be billion next year i think were planning for something several billions south of that and so were okay with volume coming down if the roe isnt where it needs to be and thats kind of the dynamic management that we go through sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 okay and sorry if i missed this but if as far as the share repurchase how should we think about next year and then what you guys intend to do in terms of capital return or capital management thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah so obviously this year we had our board approved a billion buyback plan we got through third quarter have executed billion we have our kind of our ongoing corporate 10b51 in place so well buy in the neighborhood probably of millionish or so in the fourth quarter and so they will get around billion by the end of this year i think as im sure you knew and modeled we had no intentions of being out there next year with the billion plan it wasnt even a billion plan and so our natural expectations were for buybacks to be coming down i think well still be active obviously scb is going to influence that to some degree were still carrying plenty of excess capital relative to our targets and so we will still be very prudent and efficient in buyback but its not going to be sanjay in the neighborhood of billion billion like we did this year im not even sure it will be half of that but the one page i love probably more or one chart that i love probably more than any in this deck is we have been aggressive buyers of our share from the time we ipoed at million shares outstanding to now were down to million thats been a very disciplined efficient uses of capital maybe the flip side of that is its a lot easier to move basis point or in terms of eps youre down to like million or million which is not a lot of room in terms of the income statement to move your eps projections so thats one of the factors we face but well keep being disciplined deployers of capital but dont expect a magnitude like you saw this year or the past couple of years really sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay appreciate it jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thanks sanjay sean leary headinvestor relations
