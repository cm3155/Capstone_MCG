chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning and thank you for joining us today i want to first by apologizing ill sound like a broken record using the word record over and over again it really was an outstanding year and quarter i wish management could take credit but it is really the work of our advisors and associates that delivered these results their dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing weve proven once again that focusing on our time tested client first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisors and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions in this case and record setting fashion the record results we generated would not have been possible without everyones contribution so thanks again starting on slide with our quarterly results the fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of billion and record quarterly net income of million or earnings per diluted share of which reflects the impact of the 3for2 stock split in september excluding the million of acquisition related expenses quarterly adjusted net income was million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equal the increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees primarily due to higher private client group assets and feebased accounts annualized return on equity for the quarter was and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was a very impressive result especially in the near zero rate environment and given our strong capital position moving to slide we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of trillion up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially we also achieved record pcg assets and fee based accounts of billion and record financial assets under management of billion we continue to focus on supporting advisors and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client focused culture as a result we had a fantastic year in terms of advisor retention as well as record results and recruiting new advisors to the raymond james platform through our multiple affiliation options we ended the quarter with records of financial advisors net increases of over the prior period and over the preceding quarter representing a new record during the fiscal year we recruited financial advisors with approximately million of trailing 12month production and approximately billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels also in the private client group advisors generated domestic net new assets of approximately billion in fiscal representing of domestic pcg assets at the beginning of the fiscal year a very strong result reflecting our excellent retention and record recruiting additionally this year new account openings and advisor productivity were very strong contributing to the excellent net new asset results also worth noting on the slide is the impressive loan growth at raymond james bank during the quarter up sequentially to a record billion this growth was driven by securitiesbased raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 loans to the private client group clients as well as a strong corporate loan growth moving to segment results on slide the private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million a pretax margin reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year the capital markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million representing an extremely impressive pretax margin to net revenues these record results were driven by record investment banking revenues strong tax credit fund revenues and solid fixed income brokerage revenues the asset management segment generated record net revenues of million and record pretax income of million up and over the year ago period respectively these results were primarily due to growth in financial assets under management driven by net inflows through feebased accounts in the private client group partially offset by market depreciation and net outflows for the carillon tower advisers during the quarter raymond james bank generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million quarterly net revenues increased over the year ago quarter as higher levels of earning assets offset yearoveryear compression in the banks net interest margin sequentially net revenues grew due to higher asset balances during the quarter the pretax income growth yearoveryear was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower bank loan provision for credit losses in the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter the banks pretax income decline largely due to reserve release in the preceding quarter compared to a loan loss provision primarily associated with the strong loan growth during the fiscal fourth quarter looking at the fiscal year results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion up over fiscal year and record net income of billion up over fiscal excluding losses on the extinguishment of debt and acquisition related expenses during the year adjusted net income was billion up over adjusted net income in fiscal moving to the fiscal year results on slide the private client group capital markets and asset management segments generated record net revenues and record pretax income and all of our segments realized substantial operating leverage during the fiscal year once again these results reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses and now for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter financial results im going to turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thank you paul ill begin with consolidated revenues on slide record quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and sequentially record asset management fees grew sequentially commensurate with the sequential increase in the beginning of the quarter balance of feebased assets private client group assets and feebased accounts were up during the fiscal fourth quarter providing a modest tailwind for this line item for the first quarter of fiscal consolidated brokerage revenues of million grew over the prior year but declined from the preceding quarter institutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid albeit down from the strong levels of the comparison periods brokerage revenues in pcg were up on a yearoveryear basis but flat sequentially due to lower trading volumes which offset the benefit from higher asset balances and associated trailing commissions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 for the fiscal year brokerage revenues were up to a record billion reflecting records for both pcg and fixed income which had a fantastic year that was a testament to their leading position in the depository segment account and service fees of million increased yearoveryear and sequentially largely due to a higher average mutual fund assets driving higher associated service fees paul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter so let me touch on other revenues other revenues of million or up sequentially primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues we also had million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter of which approximately million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for our interest earning assets and the balances with thirdparty banks that generate our rjbdp fees ended the quarter at a record billion up over the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets as we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from thirdparty banks during fiscal billion of client cash is being held and the client interest program at the broker dealer over time that cash could be redeployed to our bank or thirdparty banks as capacity becomes available which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on shortterm treasuries on slide it was great to see an sequential increase in the combined net interest income and bdp fees from thirdparty banks to million this growth was largely attributable to strong asset growth in a resilient net interest margin at raymond james bank which remained right at for the quarter we expect the banks nim to settle right around over the next couple of quarters the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks remain flat a basis points in the quarter if banks demand for deposits doesnt improve from current levels we believe there will be downward pressure on this yield in fiscal especially in the back half of the fiscal year which is why we have been so focused on generating on balance sheet growth in assets that could deliver good risk adjusted returns moving to consolidated expenses on slide first our largest expense compensation the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from to largely due to record revenues in the capital markets segment which had a very low compensation ratio during the quarter given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of or lower in this near zero shortterm interest rate environment and as we experienced in fiscal we can do meaningfully better than with capital markets revenues at or near these record levels which is our expectation for at least the next quarter or two noncompensation expenses of million decreased sequentially primarily driven by the million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter somewhat offsetting this favorable variance we had a modest provision for credit losses during the quarter compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal third quarter overall our results in fiscal show we have remained focus on managing controllable expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients while we are still finalizing our fiscal budget we do expect expenses to increase meaningfully in fiscal for a variety of reasons first and foremost we are going to continue investing in people and technology to support the phenomenal growth of our business over the past year ensuring we maintain very high service levels and leading technology solutions for advisors and their clients raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 we also expect business development expenses to pick up as travel recognition trips and conferences have already started resuming in the fiscal first quarter which our advisors and associates are really excited about just as a reminder business development expenses totaled about million in fiscal before the start of the pandemic additionally whereas we had a million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal we would expect bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth in fiscal slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters pretax margin was in the fiscal fourth quarter of and adjusted pre tax margin was which was boosted by a record revenues and still relatively subdued business development expenses at our analyst and investor day in june we outlined a pretax margin target of to in this near zero interest rate environment and right now we believe the topend of that range is an appropriate target given the aforementioned expense growth we currently expect in fiscal but as we experienced during the fiscal year theres meaningful upside to our margins when capital markets revenues are strong as they have been in fiscal on slide at the end of the quarter total assets were approximately billion an sequential increase reflecting solid growth of loans at raymond james bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet liquidity and capital remained very strong the total capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of are both over doubled the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized given the significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business you can see that rjf corporate cash of the parent ended the quarter at billion decreasing during the quarter as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the charles stanley acquisition which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal where as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters during the fiscal year we repurchased nearly million shares split adjusted for million as of october 27th million remains under the current share repurchase authorization due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of tristate capital holdings we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank the credit quality of the banks loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve criticized loans declined and nonperforming assets remain low at just basis points the bank loan loss provision of million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of the loans held for investment declined from in the preceding quarter to at quarter end for the corporate portfolios these allowances are higher at around with that ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul overall im very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year which exceeded many records as for our outlook we are wellpositioned entering fiscal with strong capital ratios raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 quarter end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial advisor recruiting and investment banking in the private client group segment results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first quarter with a sequential increase of assets and feebased accounts additionally based on our robust recruiting pipeline we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as prospective advisors are attracted to our client focus values and leading technology platforms in the capital markets segment the investment banking pipeline remains very strong and we expect a solid fixed income brokerage results driven by demand from the depository client segment and the asset management segment with equity markets remain resilient we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management and raymond james bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet we will continue to focus on lending to pcg clients through our securitiesbased loans and mortgages and we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agencybacked securities portfolio as we look ahead we remain focused on the longterm and our longterm growth and as weve outlined at our recent analyst and investor day those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core businesses continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic ma our recent announcements to acquire a tristate capital and charles stanley group demonstrate our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time we believe these acquisitions stay true to our longstanding criteria which is a good cultural fit a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders finally thank you again to our advisors and associates for providing excellent service to their clients during these uncertain times these results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the raymond james family with that im going to turn it back over to the operator for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of devin ryan of jmp securities please proceed with your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc good morning paul and paul how are you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc good so paul a lot of records as you mentioned so clearly momentum really across the business heading into i appreciate that the capital markets segment can drive some variability in margins and so thats tough to predict and so that kind of all gets wrapped up in the firmwide kind of margin commentary but if we set that aside and we think about the business i mean youre sitting in a much better place heading into than you were in and i appreciate that youre also going to be ramping investment into the business as well which makes sense so as we think about the individual segments whether its pcg or asset management or the bank can you talk about where operating leverage may exist and then where its more challenges because of the investments i think that would be helpful to unpack way from some of the maybe the difficulty in predicting capital markets because it does feel like there should still be some operating leverage on some of those areas but ph wonder just dig into this a little bit paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so the business thats probably its our best business but probably most margin challenged the private client group because it has the high comp ratio with our independent contractors and if youre to deliver margins in the business when you have a comp ratio or less in these times right shows the balance we have on really managing expenses and making sure we invest so we had a good margin this year based on the growth but the real delta in our margins come from the capital markets and the banks as they grow and asset management they have much higher margins and to the extent they grow they drive our comp ratio down and our margins up so those are the ones that have the delta now the good news is the backlog in capital markets is fantastic its at historic basis and the problem with that business as you know can stop on a dime and it can increase but our visibility is really good into this first quarter which is very strong and the second quarter should be very good too after that you never really know because of the ma and underwriting part depends on the environment the bank we expect good growth you saw very good growth this quarter and given the markets right now and i think a reasonable economy going forward the best we all can tell we should have growth there raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 and the asset management business continues to grow especially with our record recruiting and were still on that same pace if you look at commits and people coming through the office we are still on a very very were still at that record pace if you took a snapshot today so shorter term we see these kind of very good margins but if capital markets slowdown or the economy turns and ma deals stop and stuff thats where were going to get the margin compression again without interest rates it wasnt that long ago that half of our pretax income was interest spreads so weve ph last said that overnight when march over two fed meetings and so its kind of amazing getting these kind of margins without that help so thats the other factor and so we cant predict if that comes back even if the markets cool down thats certainly going to continue to expand margins so i wish i could tell you i can tell you where we sit today it looks good from the next quarter but between the economy and congress and regulators and interest rates it all could change because those arent in our control devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah i really appreciate that paul and helpful context across the businesses here just a quick follow up on the fixed income brokerage business and maybe the outlook here talking about how well the firm has done here i mean revenues were up from can you just help us a little bit around the both maybe the nearterm outlook for that business and then how to think about ph intermediate term because it had such a step function in growth and contribution is the size of the platform or personnel of that much greater or has it just been an environment i know the environment has been incredibly favorable but how you guys are thinking about that business and how maybe ph car were above average for the business or whether its just been kind of some underlying growth there that maybe we havent foreseen in the platform paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thats a little of both theres some new product focus and products theyve brought to the market to their clients the biggest factor has really been if you look at the sweet spot in the business thats the depository franchise and the depository franchise like all banks and us have a ton of cash and in order to put that cash to work they can make loans and if they cant make loans fast enough they buy securities and thats where they really utilize us as actually for us a lot of banks almost as a treasury manager we help them look at where they should invest in the spreads and yields we provide a lot of tools for them and that business has been very very good because of the cash in the system so as long as that cash in the system stays there those brokerage revenues should be very very good and again the fixed income business by far had its best record as did the equity capital markets business so combine the capital markets segment was extremely good and again shortterm to midterm everything we see today we dont see that really slowing down off its pace its been a little slower in the last quarter than it had been earlier in the year but id still call the numbers robust devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thank you very much raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 operator and our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia of morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah just to followup on the pretax margin questions maybe a twopart question on the comp ratio i know youve guided to a ratio of less than but at youre coming in well below and i sort of wanted to assess how much of this is the benefit of scale and other platform rather than the strength in the capital markets so first on the pcg side a lot of the comp ratio decline has to do with the actions that youve taken to hold administrative costs down even as the fa head count and revenues have grown so how should we think about the administrative and incentive comp in that segment going forward given the recruiting momentum that youre seeing right now and then second on the investment banking side if capital markets normalized to pre pandemic levels how should we think about the comp ratio there paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so first thing i think youve got to take the capital markets you asked if it was scale for the market certainly its been a very constructive market so everyones done well in capital markets but weve really increased our scale to in our equities business if you look at the addition of financo and cebile during this quarter which again they only have a full year run rate in those numbers cebile being the most recent to join the platform and the hiring weve done across the platform the leadership there has done a really good job of building scale but we were probably under scaled given our size competitors so there is a scale play there but the markets are very very constructive so its a little bit of both in that business and in the private client group a lot of business development expenses were low we didnt have conferences we didnt have award trips we didnt have the regional meetings because of the pandemic and now those are opening up we have our first major conference will be in november and weve had smaller conferences and our first award trip although theyre smaller than traditional theyre still there and theres some make up award trips where we canceled them and moved them into this year and so well have some double trips and fact in our employee group well have a double conference because were going to we moved this years to the fall and next years will come in the summer so certainly those expenses are back up raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 so thats just business as normal and those are highly valued by advisors theyre a great cultural tool to reinforce the value of raymond james for a great training these arent just fun trips to people theyre fun because we get together but its work i mean there are classes trainings teaching so theyre very important to the longterm business both teaching practice management and sharing best practices as well as explaining new regulations or new technology tools they need to learn so theyre very very valuable so its work i mean fun work but its work so theyre essential and those will return because theyre important to the business model paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah maybe the only thing i would add to that is that comp ratio does fluctuate from quartertoquarter due to a lot of variables so i kind of prefer to look at it on annual basis it was for the fiscal year which was still much better than our target largely due to the capital markets results their comp ratio this year was it was last year and last year was a pretty good year once you put it all together just to show you the sensitivity there and in the private client group you mentioned some of the initiatives frankly with the nonfa comp up year overyear against the revenue growth rate while we always strive to achieve operating leverage frankly that gap is not sustainable we want to make sure that were providing adequate support levels for our advisors and their clients and so we need to make sure we have sufficient capacity and bandwidth in our service and product areas to continue delivering excellent service to our advisors and their clients so when you kind of put all those things together thats why were sort of reaffirming the target but with that being said we can continue to do better than that if capital markets results are as strong as they have been and we expect them to be at least over the next quarter or two paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and i think one thing i havent heard in the industry calls but we certainly hear and all the industry trades is theres pressure on comp i mean pay is going up we can tell by the offers that come in to our people whom were glad people value our folks and but or comp increases its taking longer to fill jobs right now in this market and everyones growing so thats not just us industry wide theres comp pressure and i think thats going to impact the comp ratio coming this year i cant tell you what itll be but we need people who run the business and support our advisors so manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great i appreciate all the color and then maybe on the tristate acquisition can you talk about how much operating leverage is embedded in their model so theyve had a pretty steady comp ratio in their bank for the last three to four years but with of their assets skewed to shortend rates it feels like there should be room to drop some of that to the bottom line when rates rise so i was wondering if you can comment on that and whether thats baked into your accretion estimates that you announced last week paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah they have theyre technology enabled modeled and so their technology does give them the ability to particularly in the private banking side to really scale up that business but as you point out i think where the raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 operating leverage is really going to come from is rising shortterm rates and we talked about a relatively conservative net interest margin type estimates that we baked into our projections that would go up to from where they are now with a basis point increase in rates and they were actually doing much better than that before the pandemic so we try to be conservative there and that doesnt even give them the benefit of where we expect most of the synergy to come from which is really replacement of their higher cost deposits a portion of their higher cost deposits with our lower cost deposits that are sitting on our balance sheet now earning very little and shortterm treasuries at the broker dealer per the regulations so between shortterm rate increases deposit replacements and the scalability of their technology enabled model we think there is significant upside to their results over time paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and weve got a lot of questions just why dont you replace all their deposits with our lower cost deposits and its that they support deposits from their client relationships their asset and liabilities thats how you build relationships and theyre going to run an independent business that way and they have their own clients theyre going to manage their clients and so part of that is taking their cash reasonable rates to their clients for the loans they book too so we put it i think we said billion of replacement but that leaves the rest of their deposits in place and as they grow we expect to use more and more of our deposits at a lower cost but certainly theyll tell us when they need them and were not going to interfere with their longterm client relationships manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of jim mitchell of seaport research please proceed with your question jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning guys maybe just on getting back to the noncomp side i get the fact that business development there should be a lot higher as we reopen and recruiting picks up but you mentioned kind of levels other firms have kind of talked about some percentage lower theres some permanent changes in terms of business practices do you expect to really get back to million in or is there some to of those kind of levels paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think million was sort of just a benchmark i think it would be a stretch to assume that we would get there that quickly we are a bigger business now and have more people now than we had in and more advisors but to your point i think just in terms of ramping back up to what business as usual looks like what we have started the conferences and recognition trips in the first quarter business travel certainly not what it was prepandemic yet so i think it will ramp up over time jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 right okay and then maybe just on the balance sheet your client cash balance is up billion quarterover quarter that was pretty big step up any thoughts on of what drove that increase do you expect it to continue into q4 and does that given that balance sheet growth doe it kind of change the way you think about your leverage ratio with the two deals coming up paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that what drives client cash is first recruiting certainly as we bring more advisors in their clients have a portion in cash and we also see youd say in upmarkets you dont expect to see as higher percentage in cash but people are using it often in lower fixed income they are just saying they are worried about rates going up they view many clients view the market as frothy and now as its continued to grow and theyre using their cash balances to hedge that a little bit so even in an upmarket youve got a pretty good percentage of cash and again as assets grow and our recruiting grow recruiting is driving it and i think some investors are taking a little off the table and keeping some in cash as just the balancing or a diversification hedge jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners and on the leverage question any does it change the way you think about it paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean i think bringing the cash on the balance sheet certainly does impact our tier leverage ratio and in stress periods we do have sort of different type of metrics that we think about to absorb a surge in cash balances but a question we get a lot from investors and analysts is how do we think about that ratio and potentially lowering that ratio over time that target that we which has doubled the regulatory requirements jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners right paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc and our response to that is as long as regulators continue to consider that as a part of your metric and your requirements then we need to in our business have some cushion for a surge of cash balances because while cash balances are high now on an absolute basis they are only of client assets which historically speaking is a good basis points lower than average we can argue whether or not thats because asset values are higher than they were historically speaking but it is not unfathomable to see a situation where cash balances surged by another to and as we saw on march regulators dont give a firms relief for accommodating those client cash balances so we still need to make sure we have ample flexibility because those type of environment so when we could be most opportunistic so we dont want to be constrained by the tier leverage ratio and unless regulators change the treatment of that accommodated client cash balance which they didnt do in and im hopeful they will do but not optimistic then we need that cushion raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i also think there could be an opportunity as the fed cuts back on purchasing securities that those become more attractive the rates would become and the spreads more attractive so actually a shortage of those securities in the market believe it or not because of the fed but once they get out they are hopeful theres a more of an opportunity to use those securities on the balance sheet and move cash over to the bank jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners right okay great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven chubak of wolfe research please proceed with your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning paul and paul i just wanted to ask a follow up on a discussion relating to noncomps so youre messaging on expenses came through loud and clear comp guidance quite explicit maybe the noncomp guidance a little bit more vague or leaving more to interpretation recognizing youre still going through the budgeting process i was hoping you could help us handicap the level of noncomp growth exprovision versus that exit rate of billion i know paul youd already spoken about business development expense normalizing some but what level of expense inflation should we be underwriting for some of those other categories and if you could provide some more context there thatd be really helpful paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean again theres a lot of growth in there that is driven by business volume so investment sub advisory fees for example they were up almost with feebased assets this year and so and thats true with the fdic insurance expense at the bank thats going to grow with the banks growth and so theres a lot of growth driven variables there but even when you look at technology thats something were going to continue to invest heavily in to again continue providing a competitive platform for our advisors and their clients and to drive efficiency over time and scalability over time that was up this year i could see it being up 10plus next year just with our technology initiatives that we have on the docket so i dont want to go linebyline but i think when you look at the various line items you can see that theres sort of room for a growth i mean just again stepping back the noncomp expenses grew in pcg this year versus a growth rate so i would say in hindsight if we had known revenues were going to grow we probably would have grown those noncomp expenses higher than the now some of that was held by the business development with everything shutdown but thats not a sustainable relationship over time we want to make sure that we continue supporting the business and the infrastructure the support levels of the business over time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 got it okay and just for my followup on organic growth paul you disclosed pretty impressive stat about organic growth implied some acceleration into fiscal year end just given the strong advisor backlogs across your affiliation options and the additional scale that youve added on the ria side just curious if you can provide some context around what you believe is a sustainable organic growth rates as flows begin to settle out around some sort of new normal paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah indiscernible had such a hard you asked me to predict the future both as recruiting will it continue at this level we can tell you our visibility is it is and its i think i remember i forget how many quarters ago we talked about a slowdown for one in quarter but itd pick up and certainly it did again and so weve been on this kind of ramp up for a couple of years we still see very strong demand whether itll be a record this coming year or just very strong i dont know but what we can see today is that ramp up should be very good and part of that net new asset growth is the markets when people bring accounts over or bring in new clients and the markets up well the assets are up so it helps drive that number too so its very complex i think all we can tell you right now is its all the factors are in place to show it should be very strong again this year but to give you a number id have to know what the market appreciation is what recruiting is what just so many factors that arent predictable i can just tell you that the things that drove at last year look still in place coming into this next quarter and how long it continues i dont know we all know that this kind of growth in the market isnt forever theres going to be cycles there could be shocks to the system but i think were well positioned on both sides both to continue our growth and if there is a shock to the system our capital and liquidity will put us in good stead so steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay thanks for that context paul if i could just squeeze in one more ticky tack modeling question i was hoping you can provide some guidance on the tax rate for next year and the trajectory for the thirdparty cash ph from epos just recognizing that as you noted the banks are flush with liquidity dont have quite as much demand for client cash paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean the effective tax rate for this fiscal year ended right around just below which was really benefited by the nontaxable gains in the corporateowned life insurance portfolio so we would still guide all else being equal to around over the year now with that being said where our stock price is now we would expect it to be lower than that in the fiscal first quarter with the timing of our stockbased compensation that vest there would be a tax benefit there in the first quarter based on the current price but we think over the year plus or minus the impact from corporateowned life insurance and just as a reminder the corporateowned life insurance creates nontaxable gains when the equity markets are up and does the opposite when equity markets are down and thats sort of the impact to the tax rate in that type of environment and what was the second part of your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 sorry just a context around thirdparty cash ph from epos whether youre seeing any return of bank demand especially in light of fed tapering and maybe faster are these rate hikes happening sooner than anticipated paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say that we are not seeing an improvement in thirdparty bank demand and so we would i would say see more pressure on the capacity than the rate because i think were going to try to manage the rate based on shifting the lack of capacity at this type of rate to either our balance sheet and investing in other assets essentially and that gets helped with an acquisition like we had the tristate acquisition for example bringing more balances on the balance sheet the bank growth is anticipated to be strong our bank raymond james bank growth is anticipated to be strong this year as well and we can also accelerate purchases of agency mortgage backed securities if that demand from thirdparty banks doesnt pick up and id always really expected with the contract maturities in the second half of the fiscal year so as we get closer to that i think well be able to provide you more clarity on what the demand looks the demand profile looks like at that time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough thanks so much for taking my questions operator and our final question for today comes from the line of alex blostein of goldman sachs please proceed with your question ryan bailey q analyst goldman sachs co llc good morning this is actually ryan bailey on behalf of alex the first question i had was really just a clarification on some of the comments on comp pressure is that specifically related to nonadvisor comp expense it sounded like that was within pcg or was that related to additional pressure on ta packages or the payout grid paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc no i think the ta pressure is again we talked last year that we adjusted ta to be more inmarket and i think it shows in our recruiting were doing very well so i dont see any additional ta pressure but the pressure that were really seeing is on the admin support across whether its operations tech risk branch professionals theres just theres comp is under pressure for the whole industry i know that from roundtables every firm talks about it that theyre having longer to recruit recruiters are being recruited away so theyre having a harder time hiring we see packages come in so we know there is just we see comp pressure and until i think the market more normalizes and theres more of a return across the sector that could continue for the year so its a general comment were not i was just saying theres a bias that line could be more impacted than something but well see throughout this year ryan bailey q analyst goldman sachs co llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28oct2021 got it okay and maybe then just another quick question on the bank i think paul youve just mentioned that youre expecting still strong growth in raymond james bank is there any sort of impacts more tactically just given the acquisitions or sort of business as usual and growing the bank paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc no we have plenty of funding and capital for them to continue growing at their strong growth rates so long as they can find assets that generate good risk adjusted returns which is their mandate to be deliberate and patient but also opportunistic so theres no shift in sort of their growth trajectory or anticipated growth trajectory due to the acquisition ryan bailey q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thank you paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay well i
