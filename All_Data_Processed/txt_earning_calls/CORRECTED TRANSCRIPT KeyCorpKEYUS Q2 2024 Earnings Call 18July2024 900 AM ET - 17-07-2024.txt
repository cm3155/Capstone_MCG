management discussion section operator good morning and welcome to keycorps second quarter earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded id now like to turn the conference over to the head of investor relations brian mauney please go ahead brian mauney directorinvestor relations keycorp thank you operator and good morning everyone id like to thank you for joining keycorps second quarter earnings conference call im here with chris gorman our chairman and chief executive officer and clark khayat our chief financial officer as usual we will reference our earnings presentation slides which can be found in the investor relations section of the keycom website in the back of the presentation you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosures and certain financial measures including nongaap measures this covers our earnings materials as well as remarks made on this mornings call actual results may differ materially from forwardlooking statements and those statements speak only as of today july and will not be updated with that i will turn it over to chris christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you brian im on slide this morning we reported earnings of million or per share which is down from the yearago quarter but up sequentially on a quarteroverquarter basis revenue was essentially flat as we offset the expected pullback in investment banking fees from a record first quarter with growth across the balance of the franchise expenses remained well controlled and credit costs were stable importantly we continued to deliver on our clearly defined path to enhance profitability as we that we detailed a little over a year ago net interest income grew from what we continue to believe will be this cycles low in the first quarter and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our nii commitments for both the fullyear as well as the fourth quarter exit rate deposit value creation continues to be a positive story for key this quarter deposits grew by sequentially while the pace of increase in deposit costs continued to decelerate additionally noninterest bearing deposits stabilized at of total deposits we were also pleased to see client deposits up year overyear consumer relationship households are up annualized yeartodate finally we continue to be very disciplined with respect to pricing our cumulative deposit beta stands at since the fed began raising interest rates with respect to noninterest income we have made continued progress against our most important strategic initiatives in our wealth management business targeting mass affluent prospects production volumes hit another record in the second quarter as we added households and over million of household assets to the platform since launching this business in march of last year we have added over households and about billion of new household assets to key keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 within our existing customer base we believe we have a great opportunity over million key retail households have investable assets of over and only about are existing customers in our investment relation in our investment business overall as a company our assets under management have now reached billion in commercial payments we continue to see strength in our commercial deposits with growth yearoveryear and a relatively flat beta since yearend cash management fees are growing at approximately our primacy focus has made this a core competency for us we continue to see momentum as our clients are more focused than ever on working capital solutions and driving efficiency in their own businesses additionally our focus on verticals like healthcare real estate and technology create meaningful deposit opportunities and our embedded banking strategy was welltimed given the growth were seeing in that market in investment banking as we have previously communicated our second quarter fees were below those of the first quarter our positive outlook for the business however remains unchanged our pipelines are higher today than last quarter yearend and yearago levels our ma pipeline remains near record levels and the nearterm outlook for other investment banking fee revenue streams have improved at this point we expect a stronger second half of the year consistent with our prior guidance our national third party commercial loan servicing business also continues to perform well this is a countercyclical business that also gives us unique insight into the commercial real estate market we continue to feel very good about our growth prospects for this business lastly on loans broadly loan demand remains tepid and the pricing environment remains competitive it is also taking some time after our focus on improving our liquidity and capital ratios last year to get our machine fully up to speed despite recent volume trends we are optimistic we will start to see stabilization and potentially some growth in the back half of the year our pipelines are building in the middle market our pipelines are over higher than last quarter and in our institutional business engagements broadly are picking up as well turning to capital this quarter our common equity tier ratio improved by roughly another basis points to our marked cet1 and tangible capital ratios also improved as reported a few weeks ago we have received the results of the feds stress test or dfast which implied a preliminary stress capital buffer for key of which is up basis points from the scb we received in ill make just a few comments first even under this preliminary buffer we have plenty of excess capital our cet1 ratio compares to what would be a new implied minimum so the results continue to illustrate our strong capital position secondly we like others in our industry dont have insight into the feds models the feds model for loan losses for key particularly for our commercial real estate and firstlien mortgage portfolios are inconsistent with our internally run stress tests we look forward to a continued constructive dialogue with our regulators on this topic looking forward i am excited about what lies ahead for key we have been discussing our net interest income pivot for each of the last several quarters the pivot is now upon us nii headwinds that we have experienced will now become nii tailwinds as we go forward concurrently im also encouraged by the business momentum we continue to see across the franchise we demonstrated momentum in wealth management and commercial payments begin this past quarter and we are driving meaningful client deposit growth across the entire franchise lastly investment banking and loan pipelines are up meaningfully from prior periods with that ill turn the call over to clark to provide more details on our financial results clark keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris and thank you everyone for joining us today now on slide for the second quarter as chris mentioned we reported earnings per share of up per share versus the first quarter or per share adjusting for last quarters fdic special assessment sequentially revenue was essentially flat down as a increase in net interest income was offset by a decline in noninterest income while expenses declined more meaningfully by or excluding fdic assessment impacts credit costs were stable and included roughly million build to our allowance for credit losses this quarter on a yearoveryear basis eps declined driven by a tough net interest income comparison but as weve shared previously we expect nii will start to become a real tailwind next quarter or in the back half of the year noninterest income grew while expenses were flat moving to the balance sheet on slide average loans declined about sequentially to billion and ended the quarter at about billion the decline reflects tepid client demand a decline in ci utilization rates our disciplined approach as to what we choose to put on our balance sheet and the intentional runoff of low yielding consumer loans as they pay down and mature as chris mentioned we continue to have active dialogue with clients and prospects and our loan pipelines are building nicely which gives us the optimism that balances will stabilize or begin to improve from june levels on slide average deposits increased nearly sequentially to billion reflecting growth across consumer and commercial deposits client deposits were up yearoveryear as brokered deposits have come down by roughly billion from yearago levels both total and interestbearing cost of deposits increased by basis points during the quarter a slower rate of increase compared to the first quarter as shortterm rates have remained high basis points of the increase is due to the intentional addition of roughly billion of time deposits reflecting a more conservative approach as we prepare for anticipated changes in liquidity rules noninterestbearing deposits stabilized at of total deposits and when adjusted for noninterestbearing deposits in our hybrid accounts this percentage remained flat linkedquarter at our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta was since the fed began raising interest rates our deposit rates remained stable across the franchise with ongoing testing by product and market given higher rates through the year we have not seen as much opportunity to reduce deposit rates however we have continued to attract client deposits without having to leave the market on rates nor have we been paying the cash premiums that many of our competitors are offering to attract new operating accounts moving to net interest income and the margin on slide taxequivalent net interest income was million up million from the prior quarter the benefit from fixed rate asset repricing mostly from swaps and shortdated us treasuries was partly offset by higher funding costs lower loan balances and impact from roughly billion of forwardstarting swaps that became effective this quarter you will recall that we put these swaps in place in at a then prevailing forward rate of as we were managing the rolloffs of the swaps net interest margin increased by basis points to in addition to the nii drivers just mentioned the previously mentioned liquidity build this quarter impacted nim by about basis points cash assets increased by roughly billion sequentially we continue to believe that our nim bottomed in the third quarter of and that nii bottomed in the first quarter of turning to slide noninterest income was million up yearoveryear compared to the prior year the increase was primarily driven by trust and investment services commercial mortgage servicing fees and keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 investment banking fees this offset a decline in corporate services income which has reverted to a more normalized level at and the first half of benefited from elevated liborsofr related transition activity commercial mortgage servicing fees rose yearoveryear reflecting growth in servicing and active special servicing balances at june we serviced about billion of assets on behalf of thirdparty clients including about billion of special servicing billion of which was in active special servicing trust and investment service fees grew yearover year as assets under management grew to billion we saw positive net new flows in the quarter and as chris mentioned sales production set another record in the quarter our investment banking fees were consistent with our prior guidance for the quarter across products higher ma and debt origination activity offset lower syndication and commercial mortgage activity on slide second quarter noninterest expenses were billion flat yearoveryear and down sequentially excluding fdic special assessment this quarter we incurred an additional million fdic charge on top of last quarters million adjustment on a yearoveryear basis personnel expenses were up due to keys higher stock price offset by lower marketing and business services and professional fees sequentially the decline was driven by lower incentive compensation and employee benefits from fico seasonality in the first quarter moving to slide credit quality remained solid net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans and delinquencies ticked up only a few basis points nonperforming loans increased sequentially and remained low at basis points of periodend loans at june and as expected the pace of increase in criticized loans slowed markedly to in following our deep dive in the first quarter we expect that to continue to moderate and flatten out by the end of the year assuming no material macro deterioration turning to slide we continue to build our capital position with cet1 up basis points in the second quarter to our marked cet1 ratio which includes unrealized afs and pension losses improved to and our tangible common equity ratio increased to the increases reflect work weve done over the past year to build capital and reduce our exposure to higher rates weve reduced our dv01 by over the past months and at june our balance sheet was effectively interest rate neutral over a 12month run despite higher rates our aoci improved by about million to negative billion at quarterend including billion related to afs on the right side of the slide weve extended our aoci projections through as weve been doing we showed two scenarios the forward curve as of june which assumes six cuts through and another scenario where rates are held at june levels throughout the forecasted time horizon with the forward curve we would expect aoci to improve by billion or by yearend if current rates remain in place we would still expect billion of improvement given the maturities cash flow and time slide provides our outlook for relative to our pl guidance remains unchanged across all major line items we have updated our loan guidance to reflect the lack of demand we referenced we now expect average loans to be down to in and for the yearend loans to be down to compared to the end of this implies fourth quarter loan balances are flat to up billion from june levels we also positively revised our average deposit guidance to relatively stable from flat to down with client deposit growth in the lowsingledigit range we continue to believe we can hit our full year and fourth quarter exit rate net interest income commitments even if loan volumes end up slightly short of our revised target on slide we updated the net interest income opportunity from swaps and shortdated treasuries maturing the cumulative opportunity stood at about million using the june forward curve little change from last quarter as of the end of the second quarter weve realized approximately of this opportunity which is keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 shown on the left side in the gray bars this leaves about million annualized nii opportunity left which we expect to capture over the next three quarters with the most meaningful benefits expected to occur in the fourth quarter and first quarter of moving to slide weve laid out for you the path of how we intend to get from the million of reported net interest income in the second quarter to a billionplus number by the end of the year under a couple potential rate scenarios in short we believe we have about million of tailwinds from lower fixed rate assets and swaps running off and from higher day count the rest largely nets out and includes what we believe are relatively conservative assumptions around modest loan growth deposit costs funding mix and nearterm negative nii impact from a fed rate cut or two in the top block weve laid out the drivers of the growth assuming the fed cuts once in december in this scenario we expect about million of benefit from swaps and us treasuries we also expect growth from redeployment of lower yielding assets more specifically approximately billion of other security cash flows in the back half of the year and about billion of maturing consumer loans day count and some pickup in loan fees drives the other million to million in the bottom block we performed the same exercise but this time assuming the fed cuts by basis points in september and again in december while we still believe we can comfortably achieve our fullyear nii target rate in this scenario we do become a little tighter on fourth quarter exit rate although we still think well hit that guide keep in mind while two rate cuts this year would have a nearterm impact on nii as it takes time to deploy deposit beta we would expect to recapture that effect in it would also likely drive improved balance sheet dynamics as we would see benefit from the approximately billion of forwardstarting received fixed swaps that come off in the first half of as we position ourselves to be modestly liability sensitive next year in addition rate cuts would most likely provide benefits beyond nii higher client transition transaction activity more demand for credit and improvements to capital so we would welcome this tradeoff with that ill now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and we go to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess maybe clark just starting out with nii its a huge focus for the stock looking at the slide it seems like the million is locked in no matter what so fourth quarter nii ph or and then the upside from there is driven by how some of the second part of that works out so give us a sense of the downside risk on nii if loan growth ends up being weaker or negative in the back half and implications i guess more so for versus just talk through us in terms of are you giving good color on the fed rate im just wondering what weaker loan growth would imply and the scenario where we get to the nim versus clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah okay thank you ebrahim and maybe ill just kind of reground everybody in the whole thing and then ill get to your question because im sure this is not youre not unique in the nii question for the fourth quarter so first of all i think weve been really consistent or tried to be that a lot of this pullthrough will happen in the second half of which we would expect will materialize as you see on the slide and you noted so weve talked a lot about the structural rolloff in swaps and treasuries so just a reminder billion of treasuries maturing in the second half at an average yield of about basis points billion of swaps at about basis points and then billion of securities repricing at roughly low to mid2 yield so just thats the piece on the left that you referred to there is another million to million in day count and fees so again we feel fairly good about that pulling through we do expect deposit costs to continue to rise so lets assume one cut coming in december we guided to a mid beta if theres no cuts so a little bit of drift up if theres one cut in december that wont be impacted materially we will see some benefit on betas if there is a cut in september but we will also see the impact obviously of loan yields coming down and that will happen in advance not just because the loans reprice immediately but sofr will reflect that as you know a little bit before that cut so theres a little bit of negative drag in if there is a first cut in september as you commented right loan balances will be the variable so weve been a little weaker in the quarter than planned as chris said our pipelines are strengthening materially i think thats a function of ongoing engagement with our teams with clients and prospects as you said middle market is up 50plus on the pipeline side so keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 we do expect and are starting to see some traction in the back half i think if theres a little bit lighter loan growth than what we guided to well still be okay getting there and if its materially lower then thats a different conversation what the real implication is i think and probably where your question is going is what does that mean for and the size of the balance sheet and the loan book going there so look i do think we all expect rate cuts to come although im certainly not very good at predicting the economy so i wont try to do that but should we get some rate cuts we do think that will create more client activity were already as we talked about in pipeline and engagement dialogues seeing client interest in that i think that means even if we start on a lower exit rate on loans we will see good strong growth going into on loans in the years ive been at key other than the last months weve been a leader on commercial loan growth and i dont see anything today that would cause me to believe that will be different going forward but i do think its valuable maybe to add a couple pieces of content on that we really havent covered weve been laser focused on swaps and treasuries so let me just add something that weve included in the appendix on slide which just gives you some sense of maybe some repricing opportunity in as well and that is about billion of additional asset repricing that comes next year those yields are low3 and that comprised of billion of swaps coming off of so some more swap pickup not as meaningful as what were seeing today but not unmeaningful at those levels another billionplus of fixed rate loan repricing that are coming off at and then billion of fixed rate securities that are about so definite opportunity there youll also get the full year move and impact of the fourth quarter treasuries that will come off the books and swaps and then as rate cuts come in well have the full year to deploy that beta into our consumer book so i do think there are headwinds or tailwinds for us sorry as we get into and i think we have confidence well be able to grow loans and add clients on the commercial side as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color thanks clark for walking through the other question just on slide you look at npls and criticized picking up sequentially we are seeing a lot of banks talk more about losses coming from ci remind us in terms of your outlook on sort of what you are seeing from your customers on ci any specific areas where youre seeing credit degradation that could lead to just higher npls going forward and chargeoffs thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so ebrahim its chris a couple of things one the normal migration from criticized to nonperformers its playing out exactly as we would have expected it to stepping back for just a second our ci book of it is investment grade is secured and so most of our have very utilization in terms of borrowing so we start from a pretty good place your question is a good one though as to where sort of the action is and let me tell you where were seeing some people impacted by the higherforlonger scenario consumer goods some business services some equipment businesses on the other side of the equation were starting to see actually healing in the healthcare sector so think about seniors housing think about facilitiesbased healthcare were seeing that kind of going in the other direction the other thing that we always look at is whats the mix of downgrades to upgrades and keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 downgrades still exceed upgrades but that ratio is starting to close so thats kind of how were thinking about it obviously ci is a very broad category in general but thats kind of sort of how were thinking about it clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah and the only other thing ebrahim id just follow on from the financial standpoint we built the reserve very strongly over the last months we came in i think solidly in net chargeoffs and provision in the quarter we do expect some normalization so wed expect net chargeoffs to pick up in the back half thats i think fairly consistent with where weve been were comfortable on our basis point to basis point range i did say last month we probably tend to the higher end of that but thats really a denominator issue on loans versus more chargeoffs than expected ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator next we go to scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question so clark appreciate that sort of walkthrough on the nii i still have sort of an niirelated question maybe when you look at sort of the deposits that so the deposit base looks like its going to come in better than you had anticipated previously can you maybe walk through what kinds of deposits youre growing and what sort of what the spread looks like on those so i think theres probably some question if we dial back the loan growth expectation but were still getting funds in that will go into something just sort of what that spread looks like in your view clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so good thanks scott for the question so one id say look were always trying to grow operating accounts and checking accounts so were going to well do that kind of regardless of what we think is happening on the asset side of the balance sheet we did mention we added a little bit of cds intentionally just to get ahead of what we think are some tightening liquidity expectations and if we dont see loan growth for whatever reason and again we dont expect that we do have some funding optimization whether its continuing to drive down the brokered cds or our fhlb advances so we think well have some opportunity to do that we have built the cash position so at the end of the quarter we were kind of in the billion range so that gives you some indication of where that cash is sitting at the moment but i would say just on deposits maybe highlight a couple of things on where we see the back half going one i think positively in the commercial book we continue to have very active dialogue with clients about their accounts weve talked a lot about hybrids for example that continues to be a really good product for our clients and for key and weve actually moved pretty meaningfully the percentage of clients that we would deem as sort of index or indexlike keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 so as we have dialogue as they talk about rates weve been able to move them to a more indexlike product or structure with obviously anticipation of down rates so we think that will benefit us when cuts start to come and were continuing to shorten the cd maturities rates have stayed higher so we havent been as active driving those prices down but we have been pulling in the maturities and we do have a decent amount coming due here in the fourth quarter that well be able to reprice to the extent rates do come down so thats kind of the long view on that and wed expect weve been pretty clear conservatively on down betas if theres one cut if theres a second cut well obviously have more opportunity to deploy that in the fourth quarter but we still think well probably lag a little bit but that will be a tailwind for r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thank you clark and then a little bit of a tickytack question on the swaps commentary on slide so you said the million annualized opportunity which was thats down a little from million last quarter so ive got a couple of questions does that represent a reduction in expectations or is that weve just already absorbed that difference and the million is whats still remaining in the future clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp that should be a function of just where rates are as we do the calculation but i can we can follow up and give you the detail on that if the forward curves come down a little bit that would impact that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right good thank you for taking the questions clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah thanks scott operator next we go to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning just a followup on just the loans and the context of the whole balance sheet so im just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just how much of the loan growth versus what we see in ph ha when we see your peers is this you guys just being more conservative and can you talk a little bit about like how much did you keep of your originated did that change and where specifically when you mentioned earlier clark the pipelines like what areas do you see those pipelines coming in is it more just a straightup commercial thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure ken its chris let me start by kind of sharing with you kind of whats going on out there in the marketplace because i think loan demand is pretty tepid across the board and heres what as were talking to clients i think these are the unknowns that are keeping people from borrowing in general one is just concern about the keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 economy whats the trajectory the next is rates and its two things one obviously the cost of capital has gone up significantly as fed funds rose from bps to bps but on top of that weve just had a lot of volatility in the tenure and so today its around i actually think well have higher for longer and i think once that settles in people will borrow but as i talk to clients if they think that its going to go down and they think rates are going to go down and go down precipitously theyre less inclined to make a move also theres kind of a to 18month lead time around most big capex and property plant and equipment projects and people have kind of been putting those on hold i think the election i think that also is just another variable out there a lot of these closely held businesses as they think about things like tax policy and the ability to take accelerated depreciation so i think all of those are in the mix the next thing that i think also impacts it is theres no question that the rate of inflation is coming down and so people that were first during the pandemic motivated to kind of go long inventory because of the supply issues and then they were motivated to go long inventory because of inflation thats kind of wearing off so what we actually saw was a contraction in our utilization rate by percentage point going to your question about kind of what we keep on the balance sheet and what we place in the quarter just ended we raised billion for the benefit of our customers and we kept of it on our balance sheet and typically throughout our history we typically would have is up a bit from last quarter so that kind of gives you sort of a flavor of whats going on i sat down with all of our senior credit officers yesterday and we are seeing in the marketplace some degradation in terms of structure and as people compete for the loans that are out there we clearly are not going to reach for structure at all we dont feel like we need to do that but that is an element but its not the lions share of whats going on on the positive side were starting to see transactional finance starting to come into the pipeline for example in our real estate business of the pipeline right now is transactional which is a big change so maybe that hopefully thats helpful ken in terms of how were thinking about it and whats going on out in the marketplace ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you for that color and second question is just when we think about just the entirety of the balance sheet your rwas have come down a lot over the last year or so cet1 is growing cet1 even with aoci we can see in slide up to the stress test went a little bit tougher so just how important is managing to that with aoci number if at all relative to your regular way and just how youre thinking about just managing your capital position visàvis the loan book and rwa growth thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp ken we feel good about our capital position obviously since the beginning of since the initial proposal of basel iii endgame clearly when the reproposal comes out it will be pushed out and it will be less severe we had said initially that we had a clear path to get to where we wanted to get to on both a cet1 and a marked cet1 and that really hasnt changed the other thing that ive said in the past is i think as all these rules are applied and theres a lot of question marks because weve got the longterm debt proposal weve got the basel iii endgame i think when you put it altogether i wont be surprised if most people are where we are right now where you have kind of a mid sort of loantodeposit ratio but that remains to be seen because well have to see how it plays out on a couple of these rules keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you chris christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you ken operator our next question is from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey just on slide so its pretty clear that million plus lets call it million youve got billion in theory in the bag for and im wondering of those green bars chris and clark in terms of improved funding mix and loan growth and we just heard chris talk about how perhaps the macro environment is not that great for loan growth could you walk us through sort of the probability of those green bars staying green obviously the last two will have everything to do with the rate curve right and you gave us pretty good guardrails in terms of how to think about deposit costs but tell us a little bit more about how you plan to achieve the improved funding mix and the loan growth to be net positive to that number clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure so let me handle the first one erika so look on improved funding mix were still sitting on something on the order of kind of billion of fhlb advances so we have some opportunity to continue to bring that down we brought brokered down close to billion over the last year but still some opportunity to manage that as well and then on the margin we can kind of calibrate where we think overall deposit costs will be based on the size of the balance sheet and the loan book so we do think we have some opportunity to do that and a little bit of leverage here in the back half of the year on maturities around things like cds and mmdas so were looking at that very dynamically were watching our loan pipelines as they materialize and we feel like we should be able to pivot one way or the other based on how much traction were getting on loans christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp and erika where we would expect to get loan growth are in areas where weve always been able to get a lot of loan growth things like renewables where were a market leader and those are project financings where we were not aggressive last year and now we are the things like affordable similarly and also sort of the healthcare area where theres just a lot of consolidation keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is a followup to kens question about capital i think what struck me on slide is im not sure how different the forward rate versus flat rate scenario are in terms of indiscernible declined by that much but how time versus rates although granted you only have basis point difference in terms of the belly of the curve here is really whats going to heal the aoci and obviously the stress test was a bit of a negative surprise as clark said you guys have always been a premier grower in commercial and if macro comes back you would think that key is in a position to outperform peers so to that end i guess how much is this adjusted aoci impacting if at all your growth plan it seems to be impacting your multiple and how investors think about you but perhaps sort of square that for your investor base first in terms of how your rms are going to market versus the sort of the difference between adjusted and reported and clark just quick confirmation that should we assume a flat balance sheet from the ph through the end of the year thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp ill start with the first part of that our aoci position has no impact at all on our rms outcompeting in the marketplace thats just not a variable for them at all and to your point under the two different rate scenarios we talked about the difference is only million so it is a function of time but it doesnt impact how we run the business day in and day out clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah and i would just add to that right we do have consumer loans that continue to come down and that gives us both liquidity and capital to redeploy into commercial there so to chris point right thats not something were viewing as a limiter in the field as far as the balance sheet through the rest of the year i think relatively flat is a good place to start as i said to your in response to your optimization question that can move around a little bit but i wouldnt expect it to be meaningfully large moves on earning assets erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so just to confirm it feels like obviously the gotomarket strategy youre very firm chris that thats not impacted in terms of managing the balance sheet for these wins should we expect any rwa mitigation or credit risk transfers or do you feel like thats very much a story at this point clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah i mean and i appreciate your consistency on that particular item erika its look its something we spend a lot of time looking at and understanding which i think a lot of us did we obviously had some peers do some things by the way in places where we had already made moves so auto in particular where we had exited back in there are some opportunities for us to do that but frankly we dont see a huge value in getting that additional cet1 at the moment if something were to change we know how to execute a transaction like that we have a couple of portfolios that are likely prime candidates for that but its not clear to me at this moment that thats a lever that we need to pull to drive improved capital keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp obviously the better you think your portfolio is the more expensive the transaction is erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you so much christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure thanks operator next we go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi clark clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey gerard christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris i know this is not really quantifiable but obviously youve been at this for quite some time but i took interest in your comments about your pipelines and how strong they are can you give us some confidence on theres ph pipelines and theres pipelines how confident are you that these are real that they could pull through as you look at it over the next months christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah well we as you can imagine we have a pretty detailed review of our pipelines for just the reason that you mentioned and i look at pipelines its a combination of probability times time times fee we spend a lot of time looking at them will some fall away im sure they will will some things appear that will be relative short dated that will close expeditiously that will happen as well but we sweat the details on these pipelines where we havent been as tight as has been on some of the loan pipelines just because those they have a few more variables and people sometimes they those deals get done away from you but with respect to our investment banking pipelines were in good stead now if we have a huge downturn and all of a sudden the markets change significantly obviously those pipelines can go away but we feel good about the pipelines keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup on the credit your slide i think you guys mentioned that there seems to be some improvement in the healthcare area and in the ci i think you said it may have been durable consumer the question on the ci portfolio obviously you guys have been very strong in capital markets for a number of years and part of that i presume you work with your the sponsors the private equity guys and in earning the fees from those folks they tend to also use your balance sheet is there any evidence that on the private equity side or the loans to nondepository financials that category and i know it includes insurance companies and less riskier borrowers but is there any evidence that theres any credit concerns in that category of loans christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp no theres not and you asked specifically about loans to the private equity community obviously those are in the category of leveraged loans and we are literally in this kind of rate increase were underwriting those literally every quarter are there some issues has there been some migration absolutely but were not concerned about that universe of borrowers clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and gerard that portfolio that would drive kind of that financials concentration weve been in that 20ish years i think maybe theres one loss in that timeframe like literally one credit its super clean great returns and it is actually the portfolio that we entered into that forward flow agreement with blackstone and that was entirely to manage the credit risk concentration not for any concerns about the quality of that portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and clark while i have you just a quick technical question on that slide where you gave us the refinancing dollar amounts and the coupon on the what youre receiving whats the increase for example the on the weighted average rate received if that was to convert today what would it convert to same thing with the fixed rate loans clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so today we are putting forward starters on in for the purpose of getting a little bit liability sensitive going forward and were putting those on kind of in the range so obviously that depends on how forward starting and how long they are but that compares to the quite favorably obviously and even the that sits out there in so definite benefit there on the fixed rate consumer loans at those are probably well one the student loan market just isnt there for a variety of reasons rates and sort of christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp forgiveness keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp overhang and the forgiveness in the holiday from the government but if you were going to put on kind of the jumbo mortgage market thats probably in the to range but that isnt incredibly vibrant at the moment either but those would be the kind of comparison points and then on your yeah if you did ci youd be at so that would be the way wed probably think about that replacement rate and then on the securities that today is coming on kind of to 575ish range gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you clark clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator next we have a question from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning john clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi as youre looking at the impact of the swap and treasury maturities and the benefit to nii heavy focus on the exit rate of the nim and what it means and clearly that is a pretty positive impact on and i believe from a revenue perspective you could be looking at doubledigit revenue growth and midteens or so on nii next year in terms of growth just given that dynamic what type of how should we think about how much of that benefit really fall to the bottom line operating leverage for next year looks like it could be anywhere in the ballpark of basis points to basis points positive operating leverage based on how consensus is thinking about it if youre looking at a expense growth rate so is it that wide of positive operating leverage that youre allowed to materialize and allow this fall to the bottom line or you think that we could be looking at something less than that christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 hey john its chris we i dont disagree with your assumptions but obviously were not yet coming out with sort of what our view is of john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks and then separately on the deposit costs side i know you indicated that you expect some incremental pressure on deposit costs and they increased this quarter but a little bit less than first quarter and you cited the cds actions on that front could you maybe just help us think about the incremental upside that you think is likely under maybe a forward curve assumption when you look at deposit costs from here clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp when you say upside just so i understand youre talking about increase in rates or beta john pancari q analyst evercore isi increase in rates yeah sorry clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah yeah yeah look so we guided to kind of mid if there were no cuts one cut will have a maybe minor impact on that if that cut is in december as you know theres just not a lot of time to implement that and the reality is i guess technically if that cut occurs the beta cycle is sort of over so the question is is your beta on that first cut positive or negative i think it would be in december again not a lot of impact if we do get a cut in september as well as i said i think youre going to have a little bit of drift just by nature of stickiness of the consumer book but we think wed have kind of a plus or minus beta coming down what that does on the overall cost again you get kind of into the technical definition of beta cycles ending but i think youd see in september cut rates start to really flatten through the back half of the year whereas with one cut in december they may still be up a bit john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thanks clark clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator excuse me next we go to matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc just to bring it altogether on the investment banking fees the strong kind of pipelines how are you feeling about the back half of the year i think you talked about million to million of revenues maybe last month so how you still do you still feel comfortable about that range christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah matt its chris that is the range that we would that we believe well do our revenues will be in the back half of the year we ended the first half of the year right around million and weve guided all along to million to million and thats unchanged matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then sticking with fees the trust and investment management or investment services obviously nice growth there some boost from the market but just remind us what else is going on there that might drive growth beyond what the market is giving us here thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well that one of the things we talked about in my initial comments is were clearly really growing our mass affluent business that was the business where we brought in new customers and about billion of total assets to key so thats really the thats a big driver of that line matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you matt operator next we go to manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i just wanted to ask on the acl ratio i mean as the loans are coming down youre ratcheting up reserves from a dollar perspective so the acl ratio has been going up fairly steadily how do you think about those reserve levels and whats the right level here if the macro environment remains stable keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure well first of all thank you for the question the three things that really drive that are as you point out loan growth your view of the macro economy and then idiosyncratic to the actual credits i could see a scenario depending on how this plays out where we evaluate what the total reserve is but i think its premature right now only because its still unclear to us exactly what path the economy is going to take but as we get more clarity well continue to evaluate it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i guess what youre saying is until theres uncertainty probably keep the reserves at these levels and then when you get a little bit more certainty you can start to bring that down and rightsize that relative to your loan growth is that fair christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp right weve constantly been looking at it and adjusting it based on the three metrics that i just shared with you one our view of the macro economy secondly the size of the book which obviously is going down in this instance and also just the idiosyncratic with things like migration and what we have in terms of nonperformers and so forth manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator next we go to steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey steve clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 i want to start clark thank you for all the detailed disclosures on nii weve obviously beat that horse on this call quite a bit but just assuming that we get two cuts this year just say september and december whats your bias in terms of where youll likely be in terms of the nii range for the year clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp look i think with two cuts were going to be closer to the bottom end of our range but i would tell you just from an overall health of the business id take the second cut because i think it drives more loan demand i think it buys more capital markets activity i think it gets people more engaged in economic investment so i think its a trade we certainly would make going into versus i guess maximizing whats in the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks and for my followup question i want to go back and ask johns question a little bit different on expenses i know youre not going to give outlook at this point but if you do achieve the expense outlook this year i think its basically three years in a row where you havent had any real expense growth and i guess what were curious of theres lots of ways to achieve that one of them is just deferring expenses and projects until the environments better and is that the key just help us understand that is there a catchup in expenses coming because youve been deferring and you have an expense growth for multiple years or could the next year as the revenue environment gets better just look like a more normal expense year for the company christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so steve the answer is as we look forward it will be a more normal expense year for the company as we continue to come out of the position that were in we have been investing though and the reason weve been able to invest is we took million of expenses out last year just for the purpose of being able to invest in people and in technology and in the businesses that were trying to grow like our private client business our payments business our investment banking business so expenses will go up in as you see the pullthrough of the earnings that were talking about but we have not starved the business weve continued to invest in our migration to the cloud weve continued to spend million a year in our tech area but in order to be able to continue to invest in the business i think you can imagine that expenses will go up in but its not because of deferred expenses its just because our business continues to grow clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah just to reiterate chris point there investment will be stable to up its just the lack of a clear takeout to fund that that will be the difference steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it okay thats great color thanks a lot christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 thanks steve clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp thanks steve operator next we go to mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i think im missing something very basic and that is that you have the same no change to the fixed asset repricing you have less favorable loan growth guidance yet you still have the same nii guidance so what am i missing in my logic clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah look i mean part of it is there is a range mike so where you land in the range is part of that as weve talked about on the call a lot of the increase is going to be structural to the fixed asset repricing so the plus or minus pieces on that i think is largely going to be whether or not we have loan growth but a little bit of that muted loan growth is offset by a little bit stronger deposit performance so we hit both of those balance sheet components one to the negative one to the positive and we think those are somewhat offsetting so the amount of loan growth we see in the second half would be kind of the plus or minus on that range mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you said middle market pipelines are up quarteroverquarter is that correct and how much is middle market of your total commercial christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp the answer is the quarteroverquarter is correct and middle market would be of total commercial probably mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so even though you have such strong backlogs and it seems like you have a certain degree of conviction you still thought you should guide loan growth lower is that correct christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp we did and one of the reasons we felt that way mike is that our exit rate was lower than our average loan rate which was part of our thinking there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 and then just a separate topic chris in terms of the merger environment i feel like the topic died down here recently but you said that youd be willing and able to pursue another first niagara sort of deal is that still the case and under what circumstances do you think it would become more likely would it be more likely after the election what do you think the tone is in dc and whats your appetite christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so as it relates to depository i dont see anything happening in the near future i think the obstacles to completing a deal is first of all can you get it approved secondly if you can get it approved how long does it take and whats left of the business after you get it approved as i mentioned earlier i think theres some real questions on everyone seems to be coalescing around a soft landing i hope people are right im not sure that thats a fait accompli and so i think as youre thinking about buying a business youre buying their book and of course unrealized losses become realized losses so for all those reasons i dont see it happening in the near future what i had mentioned on the call that ph you had sponsored is i said with respect to first niagara we were able to keep the clients and keep the people and take of the costs out of the business and i think thats a pretty good business model in any industry so i think that i think there will be consolidation what ive shared with our team is i dont think theres going to be any consolidation until theres a lot so i think there will be consolidation where you will see us spending time is on these entrepreneurial businesses im really proud of our ability to buy entrepreneurial niche businesses and integrate them into our business thats really hard for a big company to do and i think weve done it pretty well and that would be things that wed be focused on in the near and medium term mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last question investment banking i know your mix is different youre more loan syndications you have mergers but relative to the big banks i know its not applestoapples completely but it just doesnt really compare so favorably to them on the other hand you said you have record backlogs in investment banking so what areas of investment banking are you seeing the record backlogs christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so the divergence ill start with the divergence we are focused on certain industries i think a lot of people had a pretty good quarter with respect to equities we did not particularly just because one its not a huge business for us and secondly equities team tend to be issued in certain verticals at certain times where we have a strong backlog and its the most important place for us given our middle market franchise mike is in ma because our ma business pulls through a lot of things like loans like hedging so thats where our pipelines are strong the other area we have a commercial mortgage business and as rates come down i think youre going to see that business as rates come down and stabilize and i think you need both candidly for all the reasons i talked about earlier i think youre going to see that really pick up in terms of what comes out of the pipe in the second half of the year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 got it thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you appreciate your question operator and next we go to peter winter with da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning the consumer loan growth was under quite a bit of pressure in the second quarter im just wondering if you could talk about the outlook on the consumer side of the lending business clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure one our consumer lending we as you know peter we dont have a huge credit card book its really mortgage home equity personal loan student loans not an enormous amount of volume in the mortgage market the jumbo mortgage market or nonconforming market or the student loan market which is generally what has been on balance sheet for us we continue to score clients where we can particularly in heldforsale mortgages but i would suspect as we go forward you will see us do and rates come down and those businesses get a little stronger youll see us support those clients very actively but probably do a little bit more of that offbalance sheet so it will well be that a little bit more as the fee income generators as we service those clients we will always have some room on the balance sheet to accommodate good clients as it relates to nonconforming structures as an example but that will be probably less so than its been in the last few years peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co would you expect just given the low yields a similar type of decline going forward on consumer side clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp in terms of what we see in this year keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co well just relative to the second quarter clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah i mean id have to go back and look for sure but you have yeah student loans and mortgages right they just have structural paydowns every month so well see that book continue to come down at a sort of normalized rate i think it will accelerate as rates come down but they have to come down quite a bit frankly for a lot of refi so i think what youre seeing is probably illustrative of what youd expect going forward peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah definitely i dont know of any unique thing that happened in the second quarter that would have driven consumer growth down more than expected peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay and then just on a different question just on buybacks i know there are no plans to buy back stock this year but chris im just wondering what are some of the parameters youre looking at to get back into the market to buy back stock christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well the first parameter would be to really have a firm understanding of where basel the basel iii endgame is going to be because until we know what the phasein period is and what capital is going to be required its thats just i think thats very important piece of the equation and for us obviously we had mentioned weve been underearning and as our balance sheet yields that will give us an opportunity at the appropriate time to revisit that but weve been very clear were not going to engage in any buybacks this year for sure because we in fact dont even have a plan approved by the board but going forward obviously like everybody well be taking a look at it peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co and then just one last just clarification question clark on steves question about the nii range you mentioned with two rate cuts closer to the bottom end of the range does that mean closer to down clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah closer to so it would be the ph towards that end of the range yeah keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co upper end yeah upper end of the down range clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah we can wrestle on those semantics but yes closer to the down peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks thanks for taking the questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thanks peter clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp thanks peter operator and ill now turn the conference back to chris gorman for closing
