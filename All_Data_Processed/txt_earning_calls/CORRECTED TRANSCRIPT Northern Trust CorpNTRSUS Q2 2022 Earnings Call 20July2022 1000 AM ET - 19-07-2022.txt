let me join in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call we generated solid results in what turned out to be a more volatile and uncertain market and macroeconomic backdrop than weve experienced in some time new business momentum continued to be strong and our capital position remains robust revenue increased eps grew and we delivered a return on average common equity of second quarter results benefited significantly from higher interest rates and the elimination of money market fee waivers related to low rates the weaker equity and fixed income markets began to impact our fees and client levels and due to the lag in our billing cycle this impact will continue in the third quarter we saw a sequential decline in average deposits however these were largely nonoperational in nature our clients continue to see us as a valuable partner for the liquidity needs our expenses increased compared to the prior year reflecting inflationary impacts across our cost base

now turn the call over to jason jason j tyler chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported second quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on average common equity was results for the quarter included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category also recall from last year we implemented accounting reclassifications to certain fees at the beginning of the year which will continue to impact the yearoveryear comparisons as noted on this page our effective tax rate was which compared to in the prior year and in the prior quarter the increase is largely related to our international earnings mix including reserves for uncertain tax positions we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to on a goforward basis lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the quarter yearoveryear revenue was up and expenses increased net income was up in a sequential comparison revenue was up and expenses were up while net income increased the strengthening of the us dollar resulted in a reduction in our yearoveryear revenue and expense growth rate to approximately and a reduction in the sequential growth rate to approximately the provision for credit losses was million in the quarter return on average common equity was for the quarter up from a year ago and up from in the prior quarter lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were up from last year and down sequentially all other remaining noninterest income declined from both the prior year and the prior northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 quarter net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million and was up from one year ago and up sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our asset servicing business fees totaled million and were up yearoveryear and down sequentially custody and fund administration fees were million down million down yearoveryear and down sequentially the yearoveryear decline was primarily driven by unfavorable currency translation partially offset by new business the sequential decline was driven by unfavorable currency translation as well as unfavorable markets assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend down yearoveryear and down sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential declines were primarily driven by unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation investment management fees in asset servicing of million were up yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear performance was driven primarily by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and the previously mentioned accounting reclassification partially offset by client outflows sequentially the increase was primarily due to lower fee waivers partially offset by client outflows and unfavorable markets there were no fee waivers relating to low interest rates in the second quarter results compared to million in the prior quarter and million in the prior year quarter assets under management for asset servicing clients were billion down yearoveryear and down sequentially both declines were driven by unfavorable markets client outflows and unfavorable currency translation securities lending fees were million up yearoveryear and up sequentially as wider spreads offset the impact of lower volumes average securities lending collateral levels were down yearover year and down sequentially other trust fees these were million up compared to the prior year and down sequentially the sequential decline was primarily driven by higher seasonal benefit payment services fees in the prior quarter moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million and were up compared to the prior year and down from the prior quarter there were no fee waivers in relation to low interest rates in the current quarter compared to million in the prior quarter and million in the prior year quarter within the regions the yearoveryear growth was driven by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business for the sequential performance the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets partially offset by lower fee waivers within global family office the yearoveryear growth was driven by lower fee waivers new business and favorable markets the sequential increase is mainly related to lower fee waivers partially offset by unfavorable markets assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarterend down year overyear and down on a sequential basis the yearoveryear decline was driven by unfavorable markets partially offset by client flows the sequential decline was driven by unfavorable markets and client outflows moving to page net interest income was million in the quarter and was up from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter down versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year while loan balances averaged billion and were up compared to the prior year northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 on a sequential quarter basis net interest income grew average earning assets and average deposits both declined while average loan balances were up the net interest margin was in the quarter up basis points from a year ago and up basis points from the prior quarter the increases from the prior year and prior quarter were both driven primarily by higher average interest rates the favorable balance sheet mix and million in nonrecurring interest received from certain nonaccrual loans turning to page expenses were billion in the second quarter and were higher than the prior year and higher than the prior quarter the current quarters expenses included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits category while the prioryear quarter included a pension settlement charge of million also included in the quarter is the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification which increased other operating expense by million compared to the prior year excluding these impacts expenses were up versus the prior year and flat sequentially compensation expense is up compared to the prior year and was down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by higher salaries as well as higher cashbased incentives the sequential decrease is primarily due to the prior quarters equity incentives including million in expense associated with retirementeligible staff partially offset by higher salaries both the yearoveryear and sequential comparisons benefited by favorable currency translation excluding the previously mentioned settlement charges employee benefits expense was down compared to the prior year and down from the prior quarter outside services expense was million and was down from a year ago and flat sequentially the year overyear decline was primarily driven by lower thirdparty advisor and technical services costs partially offset by higher consulting expenses equipment and software expense of million was up from one year ago and sequentially the year overyear and sequential growth were both primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in technology as well as higher amortization occupancy expense of million was down from a year ago and flat sequentially other operating expense of million was up from a year ago and up sequentially the yearover year increase was driven by the previously mentioned accounting reclassification and higher business promotions and other miscellaneous expense partially offset by lower supplemental compensation plan expense the sequential performance was primarily due to higher business promotion and staffrelated expense turning to page our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach down from the prior quarters our tier leverage ratio was up from in the prior quarter an increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio was a primary factor in this quarters decline in capital ratios accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the current quarter was a loss of billion with the loss in the second quarter totaling approximately million during the quarter we declared cash dividend of per share totaling million to common stock holders as announced yesterday our board of directors approved an increase in our third quarter dividend to per share the current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet to both weather the uncertain economic conditions and to support our clients needs we remain laser northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 focused on providing exceptional client service while executing on our strategic priorities to grow the franchise and create longterm value to our shareholders before we open it up to questions id like to take a moment to thank mark bette whos transitioning from heading investor relations to his new role as cfo for our shared services group mark thank you for your leadership your partnership and your unwavering commitment to serving our analyst and investor community over the past six years i know i speak for all of us when i say weve learned so much from your insights and perspective so thank you and with that please open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions and the first question today comes from alex blostein of goldman sachs michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey jason good morning everybody id like to echo your prior comments for mark as well it was great working with you good luck in your next role so maybe to start with the niirelated questions and im sure you guys did expect it given the theme of the quarter youve spoken in the past about deposit outflows about a month ago they seems like they have continued a little bit in june so maybe help us unpack sort of the sources of where you guys are seeing some of the deposit outflows the mix between interest bearing and noninterest bearing any comments in kind of how the things are standing so far in the third quarter and any sort of broader commentary you might have around where deposit levels could ultimately drop jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so ill give you some thoughts and dont hesitate if you want us to touch on a different component of it first of all just taking a longer term perspective deposits have been strong since the beginning of the pandemic including relative to peers in the industry so the institutional channel has declined in the last few months but it appears that we just we may have peaked later so if you go back to the beginning of the pandemic our deposits are still up meaningfully we started the pandemic at about billion and you see now were around billion so going forward our the strategy is very consistent we remain focused on retail and operational institutional deposits the retail deposits are effectively all operational so our second quarter deposit volumes are down but lets i want to unpack where those subchannels came from so first of all more than half of that decline was in nonoperational financial deposits and generally that is the most rate sensitive channel by far its also the fastest declining category for us it was down over the second fastest category of decline was actually other nonoperational deposits which declined about and so if you focus on the wealth channel and the institutional deposits that are operational the decline was just northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 and another dynamic to think about is that within that period we had tax payments and so youd expect some decline alone just coming from that so i think that just highlights the focus on the fact that the vast majority of the decline has come in nonoperational and then i think you wanted to get a sense of where we are in the quarter even at this point deposits have been down from the average of second quarter but they seem to be leveling off the decline that we saw in second quarter was actually largely just in the month of may and since then deposits have stabilized at about billion so thats a lot but ill stop there but that should hopefully give you a good sense of how deposits have been trending alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great and is it fair to assume that the outflows that you guys have seen albeit smaller outflows so far in the third quarter are also nonoperational and is there a way to frame what you guys think the total size of non operational deposits kind of bucket is and how much of that could ultimately still leave jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp so ill answer the first which is just what weve seen so far this quarter of that has been nonoperational so strong continuing of that theme that those deposits are nonoperational we havent talked externally about the mix of operational and nonoperational deposits and so we can think about that and whether in future quarters we want to do it unless but i think thats a lot for you guys to be able to work from at this point mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services and this is mark and as a reminder the nonoperational deposits wouldnt all be at risk i mean we had plenty of them before the pandemic and so but that is where weve seen the flows the movements so far alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you all right thanks ill hop back in the queue michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks alex operator we can go to steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question on the nim outlook just looking at last rate cycle your nim peaked somewhere in the low i saw a nice uplift this quarter and with loans composing a similar percentage of the balance sheet today versus last cycle you have the benefit of higher terminal fed funds higher nonus rates contributing as well is it reasonable to expect higher nims this cycle any way you could help us frame how you think about peak nim potential given some of those tailwinds jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so one youre absolutely right if you go back to mid2019 maybe if you look inside we were over in the middle of that year and then youre highlighting the right things to look on mix theres no reason we shouldnt achieve or frankly surpass that level the only caveat would be if you saw a very significant change in the yield curve but were not anticipating that so no reason why we couldnt achieve or surpass that 160ish level and then just as youre thinking about the starting point though we gave you that number about it was million or million in interest income that came from recovery of those nonaccrual loans and so the starting point should be not its a little net but it shouldnt be think about it more at and then betas is another thing it would be helpful maybe to give you just so you can work the models better for second quarter betas are right at and as were looking into third quarter the betas could be twice that but not a and so were still seeing attractive increase and so im glad you asked about that because we hit on deposit levels and then nim and so were trying to give you both volumes and betas so that at least gives you the building blocks to work from as youre thinking about modeling nii going forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color jason and just for my followup on capital youve noted in the past that you wanted to run with capital levels that are consistent with your gsib peers despite the lower reg requirements and given some of the aoci volatility that weve seen as well as the strong loan growth which has certainly consumed some capital of late i was hoping you could provide some updated thoughts on how youre thinking about target cet1 whether that to range is something youre comfortable running at and just how it informs your appetite to potentially accelerate buybacks especially if other categories like lending potentially begin to slow in a rising rate backdrop jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp youre right in that we just competitively we like to have a strong position relative to the gsib peers and its when were i always say when clients are depositing they those deposits are insured usually by the fdic when theyre depositing million or billion theyre effectively lending money to us and we want to reflect that our balance sheet is strong and so we look at that closely we look at the cet1 is important which you highlighted but also the leverage ratio and so looking at those in conjunction we look good on a relative basis and obviously plenty of room relative to any regulatory limits but well continue to look at where things are competitively and well also continue to look at what opportunities we have and the returns on buyback versus what opportunities were seeing northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 the loan growth we had we were very deliberate in looking at what the returns on that growth are and we also talked about the spikiness of loan volume and other activity even right now currency markets moving aggressively has an impact on fx positions which has an impact on what our rwa looks like so all these things come into play but in general we feel good about the capital levels but youve got to also note we have historically been in a higher range steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great best of luck mark in the new role and thanks so much for taking my questions mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services thanks steve operator the next question comes from glenn schorr of evercore michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi hello there so in the quarter obviously the operating leverage is welcome but we know whats coming with the lag deposit pricing and lower fees so i wonder if you could give us any thoughts on expenses on a go forward basis i know on any given quarter youll have ups and downs but just your thoughts on the jumping off point for expenses and then the possibility of operating leverage on the full year i know its a moving part moving boat right now thanks michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure well youre right that its hard to look in a quarter its in this year its even hard to think too aggressively about operating leverage for the full year i mean if you think about whats happening and the influence of rates the it has a big impact on net interest income thats coming over time it comes over quarters the impact on expenses is happening more quickly and so we cant get too excited about the net interest income coming and but weve got to stay focused on expenses but let me walk through a little bit on the expense side and just give you a couple of highlights and if you want us to drill in farther we can so first and it relates to inflation lets talk about compensation and so for the quarter just a couple of comments and ill give you a bullet point or two on third quarter the base pay adjustment came into play in third quarter in fall and thats in and of itself million lift quarteroverquarter its usually half that amount and then the head count was higher and we also had some offcycle adjustments which brought in another call it million currency helped significantly call it million to million and then but a big component is the cash based incentive accrual and so i think sometimes people forget as we do better even in a category like nii northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 were going to have higher cbi accrual coming along with it and so thats something thats really important to think about the second category on expenses that ill call out is equipment and software because that was a big that was a million lift just quarteroverquarter and we mentioned it in the last conference that we were going to have about a million lift in amortization alone thats coming through well have another sequential lift going into third quarter and then the other component that we experienced in second quarter in addition to the increasing amortization is software rental and support costs are higher and some of that is inflationary some of it is just our consumption is higher but we are at this point anticipating another similar rise and so just looking into third quarter youd see a similar stepup potentially from second to third quarter than what we experienced in first to second quarter so those are the two big categories within expenses that id call out at this point glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay that is definitely helpful i appreciate it and maybe just a quick followup to the previous convo on deposits and nii just curious it might be a timing thing you made the point obviously that your investment portfolio turns over time so you get the nim benefit of higher rates over time can you grow nim from here in the nearterm if betas are doubling just curious how to think about that in the shortterm michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah yeah definitely and the power of rates going up on where we are and if you look at just the way the balance sheet is naturally positioned and loans are probably 75ish percent floating and then even a big chunk of the securities portfolio reprices within a year and then obviously the cash position is short and so the asset side is significantly floating and so even if we give up just half the increase on the deposit side then we still have plenty of room to grow nim and nii significantly in a rising rate environment even from here glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi awesome thank you for that appreciate it michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator the next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 hi a part hey a part of your nii guide i guess higher but youre i guess youre not telling us how much higher because you tell us that your sensitivity to lower stock markets the impact on fees but youre not giving us the nii guide but i guess youre giving us some building blocks but one component is loan growth and its up year overyear and one reason some investors hold northern stock is because its perceived as a safe haven during a recession your loan losses tend to be a fraction of the industry so my question to you is what are you seeing in the loan growth especially among your retail customers how much appetite do you have to expand that are you noticing some more competition because some of your peers are mentioning this more vocally about being a growth area and does northern experience recession if we were to have one because the clients are such highend thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so a few things there on loan growth the rate should definitely slow relative to what we experienced over the last two years the last two years that growth was highly initiative driven we had a plan to communicate more with our clients tell them that we wanted to be there more in their journey of investing more in their businesses and we wanted to be being a liquidity provider isnt just taking deposits its also creating loan opportunities for clients when they need it the growth has been very largely in that type of channel and the quality and our appetite has not changed at all and we were extremely deliberate in saying our appetite from a credit quality perspective was not changing and if you look at some of the even the numbers around credit quality at this point and nothings changed all of the increases we had this quarter were in inherent reserves not specific reserves we actually had net recoveries again a small amount and so all early signs are very good and that gets into your last question was do we have a recession and do we have loan issues in a recession we dont want to proclaim victory before something like that happens but at this point all the indicators are what look good and we havent changed our appetite and what we brought on mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and im going to ask one more really big picture question maybe this is for you mike but one concern about going into a recession is the negative wealth effect and since you deal with the highestend customers especially the family offices and like whats the behavior of your customers after such a decline in their personal net worth thanks michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp youre exactly right mike that that portion of our client base does have different dynamics to it and so were coming off of a time period where as we know not only did we see asset values increase significantly but also as weve talked about in previous calls the opportunity to monetize assets if you will meaning sell businesses or real estate or whatever it may be also was at a very high level and so that dynamic clearly has changed as weve seen so you see it in the sense of market activity as far as ipos and things like that going down and as much as theres still plenty of private equity capital thats out there and looking to do transactions valuations are lower and that changes their attitude about whether now is the right time to sell that business northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 that said the position that a lot of these clients are in is that theyve had a high level of liquidity and so when they see the markets go down they are in a position to be very longterm investors and so we see a lot of those clients actually deploying capital into the markets at this point so investing that liquidity that theyve raised in the previous phase now as you move forward from that beyond having no idea where markets go et cetera but just to your point on the wealth effect theres no doubt that our business benefits when the overall wealth is increasing and accumulating their markets are robust so that is a better environment for us we think that its more resistant on the downside of it as well but all the same its at a lower level than when things are so good so hopefully that addresses your macro question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you operator the next question comes from michael brown of kbw michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp mike how are you hello michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thanks for taking my questions so the auca decline was a bit greater than we were expecting this quarter and above some of your peers on a sequential basis can you just expand on some of those key drivers i mean you called out that you had some wins in intraquarter but was there any material lost business or was it truly just fx and markets that hit the auca levels this quarter jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp mike just to confirm did you say auca michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc correct auca northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp assets under custody and administration okay yeah yeah and i can tell you and you add anything youd like mark but nothing significant from a flow perspective to call out the and so if i look at it just mathematically fx was so currency translation was a hit and market levels another and so the vast majority of the movement you see was in those two factors but the core business nothing to note from a flow perspective michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thank you jason and just as a follow up one of your peers talked about a plan to reprice certain aspects of their servicing business and they talked about areas that are experiencing greater wage pressure and capacity constraints just curious is this a dynamic that you guys are seeing and is there any opportunities to reprice your business higher as you think about the coming quarters or a year with the inflationary pressures that that you and the industry are experiencing michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp why dont i take that michael so i would say that we tend to approach the client relationships a little bit different i think than differently than some of our competitors and what i mean by that is on an ongoing basis we look to make sure that we have a ill call it balanced relation or one that is generating value for both the client and ourselves and there are a lot of dynamics to the relationships that we have with our clients meaning that were providing a lot of services that were paid a fee for theres a lot of other activity whether its balances or fx and things like that that were doing that the nature of the compensation the revenues are different and so its always kind of shifting and sometimes it can go more or less to one side with particular clients and we like to be in dialogue with them that doesnt always involve a change in the fee up or down it can be a change in the level of activity that were doing with them that they do leave more balances with us or do other things and so its just its a different approach and i would say less programmatic about going out at a particular time and looking to necessarily increase fees and as we know just over time because the asset levels have gone up thats why there is a bit more pressure on the fee side of the equation to come down over time when you have periods like this with inflation i think you do see less of that activity because all the players are in the same position so a client or prospect going out to put their business out to bid so to speak is less likely to get aggressive bids by multiple parties in this type of environment than they would in others so i would say theres no doubt that as you can see were feeling the impact of inflation on the expense side we get a benefit in the sense of interest rates are higher so thats a little bit of a hedge if you will thats built into our financials and thats just something that we look at over longer periods of time michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks very interesting perspectives mike appreciate it northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator the next question is from brennan hawken of ubs michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning good morning thanks for taking my questions and id also like to say congrats to mark its been a real pleasure working together always helpful to talk to you and wish you the best of luck mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services thanks brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc you got it sure so curious you guys gave a lot of color on the nonoperating deposits and the runoff and kind of comparing that to how the operating deposits look but i and it was clear that the deposits were under pressure but the nim looks really good this quarter so what im hoping to understand and maybe you could give us a bit of a comparison can you help us frame what the spreads look like for nonoperating deposits versus operating deposits i think that might help when we try and frame not just what mechanically the deposits might and the balances might look like but really how that might actually triangulate to nii jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yep yeah absolutely so one just a couple of things at a high level and ill dig in a little bit so i mentioned i think before probably of the loans are replaced repriced within days and even the securities portfolio about a third of those are floating and then the cash portfolio obviously is very short those are the three big categories and its interesting because in nonoperational deposits and its why i specifically separated the financial versus the nonfinancial the most extreme case of something where you have to stay liquid with the deposit is a non operational financial services channel deposit you really cant go you really cant invest that long and so that just that stays effectively overnight and it largely there are exceptions but largely and thats part of the reason why if you see our the deposits come down i talked about the fact that they were largely nonoperational and thats why you saw the decline on the earning assets come largely from our cash position and so you can see what the yields are in the cash positions and if you think about the cost on the non operational deposits again highly rate sensitive and in many instances those clients are saying its fed funds minus something and so its tight those spreads are tight and then if you work towards operational deposits those are ones that by nature youre able to invest longer and so those are theres a component of it that you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 have to keep liquid you have to maintain liquidity for but generally thats whats going to be represented in the longer duration of the securities portfolio and in todays environment where those are repricing and were waiting anxiously for those to mature but it just gives you a sense that those spreads are actually likely going to increase over time so first of all those clients tend to be those are transaction accounts they tend to be less less spread sensitive and weve got opportunity to invest them longer and so thats why we keep emphasizing this distinction between the operational and nonoperational or transactional and nontransactional is because the economics underneath them are very very different brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc right okay thats a thats really important and thanks for laying that out jason it sounds like theres a big difference in between the economics i guess my followup would be on beta so you talked about the beta increasing in the third quarter number one thats a third quarter beta commentary the roughly not accumulative right so we would be not necessarily looking to get the whole cumulative up to and then does that increase in beta also contemplate the reduction in these far more ratesensitive nonoperating deposits running off and maybe how much are those nonoperating more ratesensitive deposits pressing that beta higher are they the largest contributor and as they continue to run off will that help to contain continued increases in beta sorry its a multiparter but i jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp that is multi multipart but so let me give you a couple thoughts but dont hesitate if i we want to be helpful as you guys are thinking this through so dont hesitate to clarify anything so let me try to work backwards i may not get all the way to back to the beginning yes the to the extent that the nonoperational deposits are the ones that continue to run off faster that insulates betas a little bit and then secondly as we provided some commentary on what betas look like in the third quarter yes that is incremental within the quarter but thats us leaning in in the spirit of trying to be helpful to uncertainty we just dont a lot of what were doing is just trying to hold on to those deposits those operational deposits because we feel theyre so volatile and so were not starting from we want our betas to be and well see what deposits hold in its were talking with clients telling them we want to be the liquidity partner for them and so were going to in large ways at this point in the cycle were going to follow what we see out there to make sure that for those valuable operational deposits we maintain deposit levels brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay and the third quarter beta of thats just a third quarter not accumulative right jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yes yeah but again thats brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 okay jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp a lot of uncertainty in what thats going to look like thats less factual its less target and its more just our forecasting of what we think is going to happen based on what we think is going to happen with the yield curve and what we think is going to happen in the market brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc and so the last component of the i know and apologize it was so many parts but the last component is does the like is that based on the current mix of operational and nonoperational financial nonfinancial is it is it based on the current mix or as that nonoperating piece winds down does that ease the upward pressure on the beta you know what i mean so could allow for some better beta outcomes that youre thinking jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah that is overall based on what we currently see and project the mix to be brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp its reflective brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc i appreciate the color michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah sure operator the next question is from brian bedell of deutsche bank michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp great brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 good morning good morning thanks very much and i also echo my comments for mark as well its been great working with you so also best of luck the i think brennan got my multipart on the deposit betas as well so ill move over to expenses and the only other two categories again jason thanks so much for the granular color there the only other two categories i just wanted to get a comment on was the typical seasonal lift that we see in outside services in the second half of the year whether you think thats likely to repeat as it has in the past and then on the other expense line in lieu of having the golf open i know youve wanted to reallocate those expenses to marketing initiatives is that also a second half event like the northern open was or have you done those over the course of the years so we shouldnt see as much of a spike up jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp all right so on let me start on outside services so yes there tends to be a second half lift there we dont expect it to be that dramatic at this point in this quarter it was we actually remember a lot of the expenses there are actually volume related and so its related to you got market data and other transactionrelated services theres other items that are very volume related and frankly some of it market level related and so thats something to just keep in mind that can dominate the seasonality component of that line item and so in the second quarter volumes were down slightly and that was fully offset by a little bit higher consumption level in consulting and legal and so as we go into third quarter wed actually where we those two dynamics are probably still at play and well see which one as we get further into the quarter which one wins out and then on marketing related mike you want to talk about for a minute michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure just on the marketing brian there yes were spending that if you will throughout the year so theres no seasonality major seasonality like you had with the golf tournament and as we talked about before its less about one particular area and more just doing marketing within the three businesses brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color thanks and then maybe mike if i could just follow up on alternatives i think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks briefly but if you could just characterize the what youre seeing from your wealth client base in terms of demand for illiquid products both private equity private credit impact funds and how and to what extent youve added those products onto your platform and clearly its a great way to retain clients given their interest in that but maybe just also share if you think that it can also have a revenue impact for northern trust even if youre not managing them but rather having them on your shelf so to speak michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp you described it well as far as our approach there which is we want to be able to provide the full set of alternatives for our clients and yet provide the addedvalue if you will of certain particular funds that we can offer for them and then funds that we manage on our own or through vehicles on our own and so within wealth northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 management for the platform you kind of hit on some of the areas that are of greatest interest right now like private credit and so its a much broader set than maybe it was years ago as to alternatives when somebody says alternatives it used to mean that hedge funds are pe now its a much broader set of the types of products that they would have there and then also my comment around the growth was particularly related to south capital which is within asset management where we offer fundoffunds and there again weve seen strong interest on the part of our clients to have that type of more diversified exposure to alternatives and youre right it has the benefit certainly from a return perspective for our clients but from our perspective it is something that has a more attractive financial profile for us and one that further cements the relationship that we have so we expect although theres always ups and downs and volatility with the various categories but longer term still that alternatives will be an area of growth brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good thats great color thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you operator the next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey good morning guys thanks i just have one more followup on the earning asset side just given the rising rates and the oci just can you talk us through about where your securities portfolio duration is and what youre seeing on incremental pickups of new pickups relative to the rolloff on the backend and just how youre thinking about mixing the portfolio and protecting oci from here thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so a couple of thoughts one duration overall duration is down to about from and then secondly just from a reinvestment perspective is that were just that fact alone indicates weve been going shorter and as we as were reinvesting maturities that are maturing were leaving that powder dry effectively for the time being given a couple of dynamics one just the significant volatility in the markets and then secondly anticipating higher rates and so weve very much been not reinvesting longer on the curve at this point then what was the second part ken usdin q analyst jefferies company northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 the second part was then just related to capital in the earlier question but just about oci and have you been moving things from afs to htm or do you are you rethinking at all how and to your prior point about changing duration how you protect incremental afs from here and i guess just how would you expect the existing oci to kind of return back into capital over time so just all things related to oci management jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure a couple thoughts there one is we did move about billion from afs to htm and we did that post quarter close actually and the future impact is that should be that should protect about half of the exposure we have had on from an oci perspective and then in terms of return it should be it should be about years total to for us to recoup and maybe a little bit longer to recoup that but it gives you an overall general sense of what the trajectory looks like ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it thanks a lot jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator our next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi okay just want to make sure you can hear me a couple of questions one a little nitpicky but on the average balance sheets i think you show you know what the yields are obviously by asset class and im just wondering repo yields went up it looks like the repurchase agreements went up about percentage points qon q and i wanted to make sure i understood that mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services yeah betsy a part of that this is mark part of that was a theres a footnote i think on our reports that kind of talk about a netting change that we made and those yields i think its both on the asset side and the liability side and the yields would have been for instance on the asset side just trying to find that line which is reported as ph i think it would have been around i believe but there is so that so it was really driven by this kind of gross to net change both on the asset and liability side northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so any details there we can do offline the second question is just as we look at the 10q analysis regarding rate sensitivity and impact of bps parallel shift versus what we got this quarter obviously this quarter was a much bigger benefit than what the q would suggest and i just want to make sure i understand the differences of what the assumptions are in the q that we see versus what happened in the real world mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services yeah i mean i guess one thing i would say is in the q its a model process and it does look at the forward curve and its really a shock a movement away from the forward curve so i know that i think from beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter there was a move from the forward curve but probably not in the same magnitude of how it would have been modeled within the q michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services and so its a directional guide i mean the base case is what is not there which is what the forecast is with the forward curve but so i dont know if that helps but the timing matters a lot too i mean we came into the quarter with some lift from where rates were prior and then we also had mix with another benefit of probably basis points alone just by higher mix in the balance sheet and so there are other dynamics that came into play and frankly back to when youre doing those shock scenarios youre making assumptions around beta youre making assumptions on a bunch of different things but its not in reality this doesnt always play out that way and the beta is at for us were low and we also had movements in other currencies and so a lot of things at play that led to the increase in nim betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just lastly i know at the beginning of the call you mentioned that nonoperational deposit outflows looked like theyve stabilized and i guess my question is how do you feel your nonoperational depositors are behaving in other words were about to get another bps next week and do you feel that they are optimizing for their over these next six months already or do you feel like they optimize each time the feds moving in other words im wondering if we should be expecting another outflow as the fed continues to jack up rates here jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp i think that channel of depositors disproportionately relative to others have relationships at multiple institutions and cash doesnt have a longterm commitment on it and theyre able to seek yield when its important to them and im glad you asked the question because i dont want the interpretation to be that we dont want non operational deposits oftentimes those deposits are tied to broader relationships sometimes we do want those deposits for various reasons the reason that were highlighting the distinction is just the economics and the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 behavior of those deposits is very different and as you think about where nii is going its important to understand and appreciate those differences betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay thanks so much for the color jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator our next question is from vivek juneja of jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hello vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions a couple of one is how much benefit did you have to expenses from fx translation jason mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services so on a yearoveryear this is mark on a yearoveryear basis it was about and on a sequential basis it was about and thats for total expense vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right right and most of that would show up in which lines mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services most in comp and benefits it would be as i look at it probably michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp a little on equipment and software as well mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 yeah the equipment and software and youre probably looking at just like our expense base i guess maybe twothirds of that probably be in within comp and benefits vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay completely different question wealth management assets and sorry wrong one asset servicing assets under management fell linked quarter much more than overall wealth management aum was down much less seems like a lot any color on that but it seems more than what markets dropped jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure yeah that was look we had outflows in the money market mutual fund business and so that business has grown significantly since prepandemic but declined in the quarter from a flow perspective vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator the next question is from jeff harte of piper sandler michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning jeff jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys excuse me one question left for me how do you expect funding costs on nonus interest bearing deposits to move with the ecb hiking im just trying to think could we see some nearterm pressure on nim or nii as ecb goes from negative through the zero bound to something higher than basis points jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yes higher beta and the client its and again im glad you brought that up the in for clients where they have potentially been in negative rates were expecting betas to be higher this is clients who say we understand that were a negative but when do we get out and thats the one channel where we expect that to be aggressive mark what would you anything to add there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services the only thing i would i was just going to mention that the size of that so the euro deposits for us its about its a little bit over of our total deposits so thats just something to keep in mind from an order of magnitude perspective jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay any guess to how much higher betas might be there it would be truly a guess i suppose but jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah its just super hard to tell and sometimes rates are part of larger pricing and relationship considerations but we would just expect at this point in the curve for those betas to be quite high and again not its of the total its not tremendous an impact but i dont think its crazy to assume and again were im just speculating say to i dont think it changes the dynamics of the outcome significantly on nii but its but when i when we say significantly higher its not versus its more like to is a safer way to model it jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator next question is from alex blostein of goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys thanks for taking the follow up michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hello again alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hello again thanks for taking the follow up i wanted just to get your perspective maybe top of the house view on operating leverage and over the years weve kind of gotten accustomed to thinking about operating expenses as a percentage of fees and obviously quartertoquarter that will move around and you guys gave some explicit guidance i guess for a couple of line items northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 so really just kind of want to zoom out and think about in an environment were in today where the markets are a little choppier and i guess to say the least an inflation is rising what is the new normal for that expensetofee ratio over the next say a year or two right so clearly you guys are highlighting that some of the higher nii will show up in comp with respect to i guess incentivebased compensation so that will i guess also pressure that expensetofee ratio so help me just kind of think through that is it like if we lived in a are we now thinking like 110plus and are there any expense initiatives that you guys are starting to contemplate beyond it feels like the budgeting for this year has sort of left the station but any incremental thoughts there would be helpful michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure alex its mike so the way that were thinking about it is that as you pointed out a number of factors on both the revenue side and on the expense side that we want to be in the range for pretax margin of kind of that mid low to mid thats the type of range that gets us at the higher end of our roe target as well so thats what were shooting for and then youre exactly right were also looking at that expensetotrust fee ratio which has a different set of dynamics to it and has more pressure on it when you have markets going down and inflation but thats not a reason to say that were not focused on trying to keep that in the range that weve been in so that is kind of the whether its plus or minus around that thats where were trying to keep it because our view is that over time thats a better more stable level or measure of our profitability for the business so thats what were looking to do as far as looking at expenses again always tried to be trying to be focused on that and i would say even though you said the train has left the station for this year we are very much focused on getting productivity in all the businesses but particularly in the asset servicing business and so those initiatives were very much in place at the beginning of the year and were executing on those and as we do next year therell be a new set of initiatives around how we get greater scale and efficiency in the company but particularly in that business alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great very helpful thanks mike michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator the next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 hi mike hi jason you guys may have touched on this and i apologize if you did i missed it on your call but obviously youre talking a lot about betas with deposits with rates going higher have you guys been able to map out or build models to see what impact the fullblown quantitative tightening will have on deposit flows at your organization do you think theyre going to reach what million billion a month coming up soon here and we really havent gone through this before were in uncharted territory so how do you guys approach that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp we have modeled it weve looked back to see what correlation there is and i have to say that takeaway is its not our client base just doesnt its not granular enough to say that there is strong correlation between what the modeling spits out and you think about a billion deposit base we have clients that have million million million million some super large institutional or even wealth or even global family office clients to be over sometimes over billion and so its just its very spiky and its hard to throw a correlation out publicly at what those models spit out i think whats the one thing id i think its instructive to think through is that a lot of our clients think about cash as an asset allocation output and so one of the things to think about is youre predicting where even core operational transactional deposits will look like is what are overall asset levels and what are market levels because our clients consistently think about liquidity as an asset allocation tool and probably less affected in a predictive way by whats happening at the macro level by the fed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then as a followup granted that market conditions are very unsettling today and a lot of disruption going on out there but theres also probably opportunities to pick up maybe some businesses at discounted prices relative to where it was maybe a year or two years ago northern over the years has done acquisitions so mike can you give us some color of allocating capital or should something come up for sale that really makes sense is that something you guys could consider in the next to months michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp gerard youre right historically the company has been opportunistic in having the ability to add core capabilities during times like this so that attitude or approach hasnt changed i wouldnt say that were out looking to take advantage of the environment per se i would say its more a similar strategic focus which is growing the business organically and then over time if there are opportunities to accelerate that through acquisitions then we consider it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you and mark good luck in the next run good working with you thank you mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services thanks gerard appreciate it operator we can go back to vivek juneja of jpmorgan northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking a followup question going back to capital jason i hear your comment on your competitively you want to be ahead of your peers is there a level below which you would not want to see your cet1 go especially given theres still uncertainty in the markets and volatility and what do you intend to do to not let it go below that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp weve got a lot of different guardrails around how we think about what to do we obviously we have not been share repurchase is the first thing to do conversely you saw us increase our dividend at this point and so i think that tells you that were not desperately trying to increase levels from here we feel fine and again weve got plenty of room from a regulatory perspective and we feel good how we look on a competitive basis and so and weve always said its a combination of different factors we have very good conversations with our board about how we want to position capital levels but we feel good where we are and always want at the same time take advantage of any opportunities in the market to grow the business and sometimes that means just what we did with loans a couple of years ago and we made a big investment there from a capital perspective in the form of higher rwa exposure and so its just a good example of how were balancing different factors at any given point in an economic cycle the absolute level is important but its just one of those factors vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and mark i was remiss thank you for it was great working with you and good luck in your new role mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services thanks vivek appreciate it operator we can move onto mike mayo of wells fargo securities michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi there mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi yeah as we had tweak or update our earnings models im just looking at page of your proxy and im looking at your peer group and you do have a lot of banks in this peer group but the two most comparable banks seem to have tax rates that are basis points below what you have so i think youre in the range of and those other two trust banks are closer to or below give or take and so the question is we always talk about pretax margins what about aftertax margins what can you do jason to better manage your taxes which is one of the biggest expenses at the firm and then youll love this question mike so would you under what circumstances would you consider a move away from chicago like citadel to the extent that that could help your taxes thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp two very different questions ill hit the first one and youre absolutely right tax rate matters and so ill give you a sense of first ill give you a sense of how where we are relative to others first a high percentage of our income is from wealth management and thats predominantly a domestic business which comes with a higher tax rate to even within the domestic exposures were in illinois california new york were in high tax states then a lot of our weve got less benefits from tax credit investments and another dynamic is weve got less income from tax exempt income and then more of a nuanced but important factor is there are limitations on us foreign tax credits and thats actually increasing in our difference relative to our peers and so those are at least a halfdozen things that are that get to the vast majority of the reason why theres a difference going forward there are things that we can look at and try and implement to try and get that tax rate down and so were not just resting on that as a fait accompli we its something that we want to work on over time mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services and mike i would say were a global company that is headquartered in chicago proud to be headquartered in chicago and like other important decisions yeah we look at it from a stakeholder perspective you highlight one which is ill say the tax rate but more broadly the financial implications of being headquartered anywhere and that is absolutely a relevant consideration and one that were looking at all the time but then you have other stakeholders that are critical to that certainly where our clients are and where we need to be to serve them but then also equally important is all of our partners meaning our employees it needs to be a great place to live and so we are very focused on not just monitoring that over time and determining if its a great place to live but i would say actively being a part of the community to address the challenges and make chicago an even better city to live in and to have our headquarters mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you mark m bette a chief financial officer shared services sure operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes todays questionandanswer session i would like to turn the call back to mark bette for any additional or closing remarks mark m bette chief
