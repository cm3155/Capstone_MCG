at fifth third we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments but rather how they navigate challenging ones in that context im very pleased with how we are executing as a company in what continues to be an uncertain economic and interest rate backdrop our focus on stability profitability and growth in that order have produced consistent predictable results and strong profitability since the bank failures last spring and we remain confident in our ability to deliver ppnr and earnings outcomes in line with or better than our original expectations for the full year in this morning we reported earnings per share of or excluding certain items outlined on page of the release which exceeded the guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call our resilient balance sheet diversified fee revenues and expense discipline continue to produce strong profitability our adjusted return on tangible common equity of and adjusted return on assets of over the last months rank as the best of all peers who have reported so far and the most stable when compared to the same period last year the second quarter marked the first sequential growth in nii since and nim improved for the second consecutive quarter that trajectory along with the benefits we are seeing from strategic investments and continued expense discipline should allow us to return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of this year and carry over into next year strategically our investments in the southeast and middle market expansion markets in commercial payments and in wealth and asset management continue to produce strong growth and market share gains we grew consumer households by yearoveryear in the second quarter punctuated by growth in our southeast markets middle market loan production and new quality relationships were the strongest in indiana the carolinas texas and california in our industry verticals production was strongest where federal government spending has had an outsized benefit including in aerospace and defense contractors and with manufacturing and infrastructure construction firms commercial payments revenue grew yearoveryear driven by our investments in our softwareenabled managed services and newline our embedded payments business commercial payments is a scale business for us in the first half of alone we processed more than trillion in volume and nearly half of all new treasury management relationships we added yeartodate were paymentsled and have no credit extended wealth and asset management fee revenues grew yearoveryear and total assets under management grew to billion a increase compared to the same quarter last year fifth third securities the private bank and fifth third wealth advisors the ria platform we launched in all generated strong performance digital banker and global private banker recognized us again as the best private bank for high net worth clients for the third consecutive year turning to capital our strong profitability allowed us to resume share purchases during the quarter while also increasing our cet1 ratio to the federal reserve stress test results highlighted our strong capital levels consistent profitability and simple yet welldiversified business model importantly we maintain the capacity to increase our dividend support organic growth and continue share purchases fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 as we look ahead to the rest of the year we remain cautious due to the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could unfold as a result we will remain disciplined and will not chase loan growth at the expense of our return targets well continue to maintain flexibility by staying liquid neutrally positioned and broadly diversified all while investing in the long term before i hand it over to bryan to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year i want to express my gratitude to our employees for the consistent hard work innovation and passion for service that you bring to our customers this morning euromoney named us the best super regional bank in the us as part of their awards for excellence im honored to be part of your team with that bryan over to you bryan d preston chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks tim and thank you to everyone joining us today our second quarter results were strong reflecting our balance sheet strength diversified revenue streams and disciplined approach to expense and credit risk management for more than a year we have emphasized the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment this approach has proven effective as the markets expectations on rate cuts changed dramatically from the start of despite this change in rate outlook our nii has been consistent with the performance trajectory we discussed back in december increasing sequentially during the second quarter from the first quarter bottoming and then has increased for two consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter low additionally our full year nii outlook remains unchanged as tim mentioned our profitability remained strong and stable which allowed us to resume share repurchases early and grow our cet1 ratio to up basis points as noted on page of our earnings release our reported results were impacted by certain items including the valuation of the visa total return swap an update to the fdic special assessment and the impact of certain legal settlements and customer remediations excluding the impact of these items adjusted net interest income for the quarter increased from the prior quarter to billion and adjusted net interest margin improved basis points compared to the prior quarter increased yields on new loan production contributed to this improvement and offset the impact of increased interestbearing core deposit costs which were well managed and increased only basis points compared to the prior quarter while total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially we continue to benefit from fixed rate asset repricing led by our indirect auto business average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially primarily reflecting the increase in indirect auto originations offset by a decrease in other consumer loan balances average commercial portfolio loans decreased due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers periodend commercial revolver utilization remained at consistent with the prior quarter middle market loan production increased compared to the prior quarter driven by strong performance in our southeast markets primarily in the carolinas georgia and florida as well as continued success in indiana texas and california the pipeline for the second half of the year is improving and we are continuing to invest in our middle market banking teams including our recently announced expansion in the alabama market however we remain cautious on commercial loan growth expectations in the second half of the year as customer demand for credit remains muted fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 our investment in analytics continues to help us optimize deposit outcomes demonstrated by our strong deposit growth in and prudent management of deposit costs in our strong track record of liquidity management combined with datadriven analytics will aid in maintaining pricing discipline and optimizing liability costs average core deposits were flat sequentially driven by higher cds and consumer savings and money market balances offset by lower interest checking and commercial demand balances our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs with the fed on hold and preparing for potential rate cuts later this year by segment average consumer deposits increased sequentially while both commercial and wealth deposits decreased the southeast branch investments are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were as of the end of the second quarter stable with the prior quarter as migration of dda balances continues to slow consistent with our prior expectations for a higherforlonger rate environment we expect dda mix to fall below during the third quarter and stay around for the remainder of the year we ended the quarter with full category lcr compliance at and our loantocore deposit ratio was we are well positioned to continue to grow net interest income and our balance sheet provides flexibility to navigate the evolving economic and interest rate conditions moving on to fees excluding the impacts of security gains and the visa total return swap adjusted noninterest income decreased million or compared to the yearago quarter this yearoveryear decrease is attributable to a million private equity gain recognized in the second quarter of within our businesses commercial payments and wealth and asset management fees continued to deliver strong results both achieving doubledigit revenue growth over the prior year driven by our continued strategic growth investments in products and sales personnel these areas are not only fastgrowing but are sizable contributors to fee income and profitability today given our strength and scale in these businesses we expect these businesses to continue to deliver strong revenue growth our marketsensitive businesses such as mortgage and commercial customer hedging have been impacted by the higher rate environment the reduced demand for credit and reduced market volatility the combined impact for these businesses was a million decrease versus the prior year leasing business revenue was down million versus the prior year due to our decision to deemphasize operating leases but it was offset by a million decrease in leasing business expense the securities gains of million reflected the marktomarket impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is more than offset in compensation expense while we have continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives and technology we managed our adjusted non interest expense flat to the yearago quarter due to our focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from the process automation efforts adjusted noninterest expense decreased sequentially primarily due to seasonal items during the first quarter related to compensation awards and payroll taxes moving to credit consistent with our guidance the net chargeoff ratio was basis points up basis points sequentially driven by two commercial credits for which we had previously established specific reserves fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 consumer chargeoffs were basis points a reduction of basis points sequentially primarily due to improvement in our indirect consumersecured portfolio other credit metrics showed strong sequential improvement with the ratio of earlystage delinquencies to days past due decreasing basis points to basis points which is near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade npas decreased by million or during the quarter and the npa ratio decreased basis points to basis points in commercial our credit discipline is grounded in generating and maintaining granular highquality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class region or industry we continue to see no material signs of broadbased industry or geographic weakness and believes potential future commercial credit losses will be idiosyncratic in nature in consumer our focus remains on lending to homeowners which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures we have maintained our conservative underwriting policies and well continue to evaluate our positioning as economic conditions change our acl coverage ratio decreased basis points to and included a million reserve release driven by the previously mentioned specific reserves we continue to utilize moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings moving to capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of significantly exceeding our new buffered minimum of reflecting strong capital levels as we assess our capital priorities we believe that is an appropriate nearterm operating level during the quarter we completed million in share purchases which reduced our share count by million shares our pro forma cet1 ratio including the aoci impact of the securities portfolio is we expect continued improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that of the afs portfolio is in bullet or lockedout securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations assuming the forward curve is realized approximately of the aoci related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of increasing tangible book value per share by before considering any future earnings of the securitiesrelated aoci will accrete back to equity by the end of moving to our current outlook while the rate environment and customer credit demand have played out differently than we were expecting at the start of the year we remain confident in our ability to deliver ppnr and earnings outcomes in line with or better than our original expectations for the full year we expect full year nii to decrease to consistent with our guidance from january this outlook assumes the forward curve as of early july which projected two rate cuts in the second half of the year september and december we also believe we can deliver this nii outcome with no interest rate cuts and no loan growth in the second half of given the yeartodate trends in customer activity we now expect full year average total loans to be down compared to average total loans in the fourth quarter of are expected to be stable to up compared to the fourth quarter of with similar performance in both the commercial and consumer portfolios customer demand is the primary driver of this change given the interest rate environment and other economic uncertainties if theres more economic optimism in the second half of the year we would expect to see loan growth in line or better than market growth fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 we are forecasting fourth quarter average core deposit growth of to when compared to the fourth quarter of our forecast also assumes commercial revolver utilization and our cash and other shortterm investments remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of we expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be stable to down in reflecting the impact of weakerthanpreviously expected credit demand and customer hedging activities we expect strong growth in commercial payments and wealth and asset management revenue to continue in response to this expectation of lower customer activity in the second half we expect to manage full year adjusted noninterest expense stable to levels our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the midsingle digits and sales additions in middle market commercial payments and wealth we will open to new branches in our higher growth markets and have already closed a similar number of branches in our outlook still projects an efficiency ratio of around for the full year for full year the net chargeoff outlook remains in the basis points to basis points range while we expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth and mix in the second half of we expect the second half build to be less than the first half of release therefore we expect full year provision to be a to million release assuming no change to credit quality of the portfolio or projected economic conditions moving to our quarterly outlook we expect nii and nim growth to continue in both the third and fourth quarter we expect nii in the third quarter to be up sequentially reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the continued benefit of our fixed rate asset repricing our current outlook assumes interestbearing core deposit costs which were basis points in the second quarter of to increase just basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up from the second quarter we expect modest middle market auto and solar production to offset continued low credit demand from corporate banking customers we expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up to compared to the second quarter largely reflecting strength in commercial payments and wealth and asset management and a modest increase in commercial banking revenue we expect third quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up compared to the second quarter due to the impact of the previously discussed investments in branches technology and sales personnel third quarter net chargeoffs are projected to be in the to basis point range as mentioned in the full year outlook loan growth and mix are expected to drive a provision build which should be around million in the third quarter assuming no change to the economic outlook the trajectory of our income statement performance should deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and a net interest income exit rate for the year that positions us for record results in assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes finally moving to capital with our consistent and strong earnings we expect to execute share repurchases of million per quarter in the second half of assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current npr fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 in summary with our well positioned balance sheet disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue streams we are positioned to generate sustained top quartile profitability and deliver long term value for our shareholders customers communities and employees with that let me turn it over to matt to open the call up for qa matt curoe senior directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks bryan before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions well take our first question from ebrahim poonawala at bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc maybe first question hey tim for bryan on just looking at slide in the deck around rate sensitivity it implies that rate cuts should benefit nii so you talked about the second half guide i think as we think about but just talk to us around the comfort level i think it says to effective betas on the downside just talk to us in terms of the deposit beta assumptions whats contractual within your deposit mix that should reprice lower and is it fair to assume that rate cuts are positive for fifth third bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you ebrahim we certainly believe that rate cuts are positive for fifth third if you look at slide we actually give a little bit more detail on the mix of the interestbearing deposit book of our book right now would be classified in kind of the higher beta categories this represents our indexed deposits which were up to billion the cds that we have in place weve done a nice job of managing maturities in the cd bucket so that most of our cds will mature by the end of the year thats another billion of balances and our promotional balances as well so we have a lot of captions where within that book that were going to be able to reprice down overall thats about of the deposits we certainly have some lower rate buckets still that we think the betas are effectively zero we have a high amount of confidence though that were going to be able to get costs out fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 and be able to manage we really only need to be in a kind of mid to low beta to be able to be neutral to liability sensitive and were confident we can deliver that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats clear and i guess maybe one for you tim i think you pulled back in terms of loan growth much earlier this cycle as you think about the creditors your comments on reserve outlook is it all clear if we get rate cuts do you just worry less about something really bad happening systemically on credit quality for fifth third and then the other side of that is whats the trigger that leads to that growth i heard you say you should have aboveaverage loan growth if things pick up whats the catalyst we should be working for thanks timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes good question i think thats the milliondollar question for the industry right there there is no question that if we see some relief on rates its a positive both for loan demand and for credit quality jamie leonard and i have been out in several of the markets this quarter doing market visits and weve been running a straw poll on where rates need to be before activity picks up and the wisdom of the crowds at least inside fifth third at the moment is about is the meridian where well see a pickup in more activity that said while rates would be constructive i think i continue always to worry about the broader macro issues and weve got land wars in two volatile regions in the us right now we have an election thats upcoming we have massive fiscal deficits in the us we have a ton of treasury issuance thats going to be required to reload the tga at some point here and theyre going to have to turn that out and thats going to put pressure on the long end of the curve and while i think we have some stability here im uncomfortable with the level of support that the federal government is having to provide to keep gdp growth at where it is at the moment i mean the jobs numbers this most recent batch unless im mistaken a third of the new jobs that were created were created by the government when we look at our footprint and we look at where the activity is where there is federal stimulus were seeing robust activity everywhere else we got a client in tennessee tell us that the current environment was half speed ahead right so we will continue to be mindful about that i am a believer that in uncertain environments you have to focus on getting growth from the businesses that you know and the strategies that are proven youre not going to see us stretching into categories we dont know or doing things that were uncomfortable with from a credit perspective and where we have to bet on a favorable macro to bail us out in terms of getting repaid ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color thank you operator well go next to scott siefers at piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question lets see actually bryan i was hoping you could speak a little bit about the fee trajectory youd discussed sort of the second quarter softness a month or so ago it feels like it might persist a bit into the third quarter but i imagine were still feeling like thatll rebound just hoping you could maybe share some thoughts on sort of when and how that ends up looking you know theres just a little more color on the fee trajectory please fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely scott the second to third quarter increase were talking about not too aggressive of fee growth perspective we continue to expect continued performance out of our wealth and asset management business as well as commercial payments payments has been ticking along at million to million a quarter increases and we expect that to continue and feel really good about it were also going to see some seasonal impacts actually come out associated with our mortgage business weve benefited a lot from the servicing portfolio all the servicing adds that we did right at the end of the lowrate cycle has benefited us and generated a lot of great income but there is a seasonal headwind to that we felt thats about million thats not going to repeat so were set up really well for that to growth that weve laid out and then in the fourth quarter well get some additional seasonal benefit out of the msr the payments and card spend will continue to pick up especially the seasonal card spending consumer well get the million tra benefit and then we always see some pickup in both commercial banking and leasing in the fourth quarter that should both generate some additional income as well that gets us to that little bit higher growth rate trajectory that you can see thats implied from to r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good and then maybe switching gears just a second just hoping you might be able to sort of put into context the cfpb news from earlier this month that just based on my read kind of felt like we closed the book on the account issues from a few years ago which is good but then there were the autorelated items so i know there are just sort of questions floating out there about sort of cost to comply cost to remediate whats within the existing outlook could you maybe address those kind of broadly please timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah scott its tim im happy to do that and i think you hit on the most important thing here which is the best thing for you to do is focus on the statements of fact as opposed to the press releases on this one i think that by the bureaus own statements of fact here these were old issues so one was nearly five years old the other was nearly years old respectively theyre things that we identified and reported and in case of auto we completely canceled the program before they ever even started their investigation and i think while of course we always take anything that impacts customers seriously at fifth third the size of the fines which are a fraction of what youve seen in other places probably speak for themselves in terms of the limited scope of the issues here we elected to close these things out because given the fact that they were small and in the past it just didnt make sense to continue to spend more money litigating than it was going to spend to settle so weve put them in the rearview mirror we have the onetime expense this quarter and thats where its going to stay you shouldnt expect any incremental ongoing expense because these are issues that are so old anything that needed to be done was already done from an ongoing operational perspective r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay wonderful good thank you for taking the questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah thank you operator our next question comes from mike mayo at wells fargo timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i might requeue sorry timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp he has to requeue operator well go next to ken usdin at jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys on the deposit side i heard your comment about basis points increase in with no cuts and im just wondering you talked about the mid to downside beta can you give us a little bit of context on how that starts and then how that moves forward and you talked about having a good twothirds of your deposit base high beta but just wondering like how you kind of expect the some of the pricing stuff youve been doing to grow deposits in the southeast to juxtapose against that downside beta thanks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely thanks ken great question what we would tell you is that what itll create is itll create some opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive on some of the rate cuts associated with the cds and the promo portfolios that weve seen historically when we navigated through these down rate cycles those first couple of cuts on the consumer side do have a pretty decent impact on customer mentality and sentiment and your ability to create some sticky balances weve been through this a few times now where weve seen the ability to convert those balances into a lower rate balance and cause them to stick around and on the other side of that the commercial balances in particular the indexed balances those are immediate impacts and will just move with the market we have really no concern around that indexed strategy its another one that weve executed in prior cycles i think weve done a nice job of kind of navigating and managing those balances up in those indexed portfolios as weve reached peak rates it gives us a lot of confidence in the ability to very quickly get those costs out ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 okay got it and then just following up on your comments about record versus nii can you just talk to us about how much of that do you expect to be growth related and how much of that you expect to be just the outcome of rate scenarios bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i would actually tell you that most of it is just the natural transition of the balance sheet in the business today i think our nii story is actually pretty simple right now its the continued fixed rate asset pricing and slowing deposit cost and if you look at just the trends that were laying out were adding about million a quarter right now just on the natural repricing of the existing balance sheet and you think with weve talked a lot about billion of fixed rate asset repricing thats happening at about basis points thats million a quarter and then the deposit cost up bps this quarter on a billion interest bearing book theres your million of incremental cost to take us down to that net million we get a little bit of continued slowing on the deposit cost side i mean that can approach million million million a quarter day count were going to pick up million here in the third quarter and then that sets us up for an exit rate where if you just take the times the fourth quarter math youre right around what is our record nii of billion throw on a little earning asset or loan growth on top of that and the path is there for us thats what gives us confidence the big wild card like we always talk about is just how competitive deposit pricing ultimately ends up being but if we start to see rate cuts we would expect to see some decent relief on the liabilities side timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah ken its tim we talked a while ago and maybe we havent been doing enough of this recently but about the power of having these intermediate duration fixed rate loan origination platforms was and by that i would only mean you think about provide you think about the auto business you think about dividend like if you just look at the yields on the indirect auto and specialty business yearoveryear weve added almost basis points to the yield in the portfolio and if you look at the solar product its north of basis points that we have been able to add yearoveryear and that just speaks to the power of both the one the sort of origination capacity that exists there that we can dial up in an environment where spreads widen and it makes sense for us to do it and two the fact that these are asset classes that are going to reprice a lot faster than the mortgages that were originated at the low point in the rate cycle and that are going to persist much longer than the jumbo mortgages and the other fixed rate product that you see being available to banks out in the market today which are all likely to prepay if we get any sort of meaningful movement out of the fed so that will be an important part of the way that we continue to drive outcomes even in an environment where you dont get a meaningful improvement in loan demand across the industry ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you for that color timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah operator well go next to gerard cassidy at rbc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi bryan timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc tim bryan can you give us a little color on slide the transfers to nonaccrual status of loans fell nicely this quarter and when you go back you give us the data back to the second quarter of and its a meaningful drop from those levels any color that you can give us on what led to that drop and then second and i apologize if youve addressed this already on the commercial loan chargeoff number that jumped in the quarter were there any specific idiosyncratic loans that caused that to happen greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp gerard hey its greg great question so ill answer the second one first so yeah we had the two names that bryan mentioned that were two different industries were not seeing any dramatic concerning trends emerging out of the portfolio geographically ph by individual by product but we talked about lumpiness on the commercial side and thats what we experienced this quarter were normalizing off very low loss rates and so when we have one or two of these episodic events theyre going to get highlighted and thats what we saw but as bryan mentioned they were not a surprise we had reserves against those two loans and so we think were through those the overall credit metrics remain really solid our delinquencies were down quarteroverquarter the npas that you referred to were down quarteroverquarter at basis points thats below our 10year average were up basis point yearoveryear on npas and its really across the board we had about million in commercial losses this quarter but we are down almost million so were working the portfolio very hard were working out of some of the npa loans without experiencing the loss rates but its really across the board where were not seeing the npas are in the commercial real estate portfolio we had about million in npas there so that portfolio continues to perform very very well had virtually no delinquencies in that portfolio so its really across the board where were seeing the improvement in our npa numbers had a little bit on the gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp consumer side most of its being driven on the commercial side fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the color and then second when you look at your shared national credit portfolio and you give us good details once again on the slide the financial services slice of that portfolio how much if any is in sectors that is considered private equity or private credit because as we all know it seems like the banking industry has been derisked since the financial crisis and the private equity private credit side of the equation might be taking on more of that risk do you guys have many loans to the blackstones or the carlyles or any of those types of companies and where there might be indirect exposure to that industry greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah yeah another great question so weve got subscription lines to some of those type of companies highly rated borrowers but as you know those are mostly predicated on an and underwritten over collateralized through the lp capital but were not in that leverageonleverage space were just were not active there weve got a couple of direct lending lines of credit they total about million so about million apiece so were not active in that space gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good okay good thank you again greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp thank you timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator well move next to bill carcache at wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i wanted to follow up on your credit commentary and ask for your thoughts on the longerterm trajectory of chargeoffs given what youre seeing in both consumer and commercial crystal clear on all the sources of uncertainty that you highlighted tim but if we assume that the softlanding scenario materializes and think about the loss content implicit in your loan book today would you expect fifth thirds nco rates to level off from here drift a little bit higher revert to levels i know you cant give guidance but any help on how youre thinking about that longterm trajectory would be super helpful greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah its greg again so yeah certainly as tim mentioned any kind of rate cut is going to help us from an overall asset quality it will on the consumer side it will on the commercial side it takes a little while for those rate cuts to play through the portfolio so as bryan mentioned in his prepared remarks we still feel good about the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 to basis points for the rest of this year then well see how the rest of the marketplace plays out but as i just mentioned in the previous question still feel really good about the overall metrics of the portfolio our npa rates is a good indicator of potential loss rates moving forward and those numbers continue to come down and improve and so i think even without rate increases i still feel really good about our portfolio get a little bit of goodness from the rates and yeah i think it certainly helps as we get into bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks thats helpful and then separately you talked about some of the variables impacting the curve can you discuss how fifth thirds positioned for either a flatter or a steeper yield curve environment bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely were typically our normal business is about twothirds sensitive to the frontend of the curve i would tell you with our current cash position were probably closer to sensitive on the frontend of the curve so relief on the frontend is part of what would be the big driver from an asset sensitivity perspective and the interesting thing about how this environment could play out is we could potentially get some of that relief on the frontend of the curve and still benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing that were expecting over the next couple of years because whats rolling off right now is a lot of that loans that were originated in those periods of really low interest rates so even if you see a little bit of lower rates on the longerend of the curve you would still have a nice pickup relative to the front bookback book dynamic so that frontend relief and as tim mentioned around our concerns that are out there concerns around continued treasury issuance if thats the scenario that were to play out it would be one that would be a nice situation from an nii perspective but it would probably continue to the longer end of the curve could cause some additional challenges for the economy from a growth perspective bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood very helpful thank you for taking my questions timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator well go next to erika najarian at ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi i have a few timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 hey just a few followup questions your cash position was twice that of last year as we think about obviously that makes you more sensitive to short rates come down how do we think about how youre managing that cash position from an interest rate standpoint versus an anticipation of liquidityrulescoming standpoint and maybe give us a sense of how much is there sort of supervisory encouragement today to keep liquid liquidity as we anticipate new rules bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i would tell you that we are very focused internally on maintaining plenty of liquidity to deal with any uncertainty associated with potential rules as well as the market so that has just been a big driver of our positioning and why weve done that but the other thing that it allows for us yes it is a good liquidity risk management tool but it does allow us to have a little bit more confidence on the interest rate risk management side as well because we can be more aggressive on our liability management actions because of that cash position so it really is the combination of that liquidity and liability management benefits that we are focused on and why we continue to keep those levels that we have as rates come down we and as we get through that environment and see stability in the market from a liquidity perspective we really have an ability to take that down over time as you pointed out it was a big increase year overyear the yearoveryear increase was a basis point impact on our nim so getting back to more normalized levels would be a nice trend for us from a nim perspective erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and ill follow up with that on the liability side later so i wanted to squeeze in a second question and this is for you tim tim i think that you and management and the board have done such a great job in terms of the makeover of fifth third and now investors essentially take for granted and see you as a highquality bank among your peers to that end it seems like the cfpb stuff in terms of your response to scotts question is in the rearview mirror the one question i keep getting from investors is are you still the proper owner for dividend and it made sense in terms of when you did the deal and obviously solar is the future but its clearly something that is a product thats sold not bought and given all the litigation against you it just doesnt feel on brand from a quality perspective in terms of how youve rebuilt fifth third so how are you thinking about i mean its so small but its like it comes up in conversations often right but like the impact to your stock is it feels like more than the impact to earning so love your thoughts there timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp all right sure so just to make sure that im clear and i know you were but i mean dividend has nothing to do with the cfpb so that is erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc right right timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp those are two separate issues right right fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp okay the erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes separate issues timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes look on the dividend front right we are believers that the best way to get growth is to attach yourself to longterm secular trends so that focus on the southeast was to get the bank linked to the demographic migration that was going to support the growth in that market the focus on commercial payments has been about attaching ourselves to this trend in digitization in general and in particular the intermediation of these legacy workflows with software and in the case of dividend and what weve elected to do on the project finance on the commercial solar side of the equation the focus is on both the diversification of energy sources with a focus on renewable and i think in particular in the case of dividend the need that were going to have across the country to have more distributed power generation and storage if were going to avoid rolling brownouts and other sorts of issues that come from the fact that we have a very old energy infrastructure and in particular now with the explosion in data centers that are going to be required to support ai and otherwise a lot of very powerintensive commercial applications so we view the residential solar and battery storage as an important part of the way that our customers and people we dont do business with today are going to be able to meet their power needs in the future and i actually think that for products like this with an intermediate duration and a superprime credit risk profile banks are the best source of liquidity and not the worst the focus is just making sure that you do business with the best because youre right the same way that in auto were reliant on the quality of care that the dealer provides to ensure that our borrower has a good experience were reliant on the quality of the installer and the actions that we took shortly after acquiring dividend to refocus the business on the best installers in the portfolio are going to continue to be we think a very viable and high quality way to go to market erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and just to follow up here im sorry that im taking up a third question are you confident that after the vendor changes that youve made that fifth third is not going to be in the news with like some older lady saying like she got solar panels she cant afford right thats the risk i totally get the secular trend and everything that you have said makes so much elegant sense but i think thats the risk that investors are trying to ph ensure that its not embedded in your stock which is obviously not an eps impact necessarily but a reputational litigation impact fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp sure there were some installer failures as interest rates rose because the volume went down i think its a matter of policy here we take care of the customer so if an installer is unable to complete a job we complete it on behalf of the installers we have done that in every case where we had an installer who was unable to complete a project and get it to pto and you would expect that we you should expect that were going to continue to do that thats the standard of care that we would provide for any customer inside the bank regardless of the channel that they came through regardless of the product and so as those installer failures work their way through the system were going to take care of the customer erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you so much tim operator well go next to manan gosalia at morgan stanley manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to follow up on your comments on the level of cash you noted that the lcr is is there room to take on a little bit more duration and deploy some of this excess liquidity because you really need to be that far above the threshold bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp no i think the other issue that youre facing right now is youre actually not getting paid to extend your duration given the inversion of the yield curve i mean the 10year rate this morning is what but were earning on the frontend of the curve and given our rate outlook we just dont think it makes sense at this point to be adding duration giving up earnings today when we think over the horizon that were not sure that is a good entry point manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then bryan at our conference last month you noted that you were seeing some competition drive driving loan spreads lower across the industry and yeah thats not necessarily a level that youre always comfortable with has that continued since then if yes i know you dont want to lean in here but with deposit costs coming down is there some more room to lean in there and do indiscernible fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp again were looking for a were looking for the spots where it makes sense to continue to evaluate where loan growth should come from as tim talked about were certainly not going to sacrifice on earning appropriate returns as part of this but just given some of the confidence that we have in terms of that we think we are going to see a cut this year that we are going to start to see some relief and we are starting to see a little bit of the animal spirits in the market start to build like our pipelines are looking better than where they were three months ago six months ago so we think theres going to be opportunity to continue to see some growth in those areas and feel good about the positioning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator well move next to matt oconnor at deutsche bank timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys there was an article earlier this week just talking about risk in the commercial bond market and you guys have commercial real estate bond market that is you guys have a good slide on just reminding all of us that a lot of it or most of it is agency can you talk to the nonagency cmbs and i guess kind of like almost like dumb down ph what these are bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp you cut out there right at the end could you repeat the end of the question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc ph just give some color and the protection there thanks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah so the so we obviously have had a very cautious outlook from a commercial real estate perspective for a really long time we do think that there is some value in participating in the market and so where weve really chosen to do that is in that nonagency portfolio and structured form because we do think those structural enhancements create a lot of credit protections for us the article that you were mentioning this week was in regards to a specific structure called a sasb a singleasset singleborrower structure which funny enough basically every commercial real estate loan is a singleasset singleborrower structure but in our case for our broader portfolio we have very little sasb within our portfolio i had mentioned about a month ago at morgan fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 stanley that that amount was about million for us and all of our bonds in that structure are continue to be performing very very strongly the broader structure we have nearly credit enhancement that is in front of us from a firstloss perspective and the weighted average loantovalue on the nonagency portfolio is still around we use some advanced analytic tools that the industry has available and we stress the portfolio regularly as part of our process our credit underwriting team underwrites and evaluates the top loans in every structure to make sure that we are comfortable we monitor the portfolio very closely and continue to have no concerns on what were seeing matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay perfect thats helpful thank you operator well go next to christopher marinac at janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning i wanted to ask about the commercial criticized and the fact that you had some of the chargeoffs this quarter would that improve those and do you see any other kind of upgrade trends that could happen in future quarters greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp i mean yeah these chargeoffs are going to both of those loans and overall chargeoffs are coming out of the criticized so yeah anytime were going to have commercial chargeoffs its going to improve we were pretty stable quarteroverquarter in our criticized and were starting to see it level off and so im not overly worried that were going to see continued increases based on what we know today based on unforeseen economic conditions timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah i think the trend in criticized in general has actually been encouraging from my perspective greg you may want to talk about this but the only real growth weve seen in criticized are a few abl facilities if you look at it over the last months and were well secured there and well within the collateral greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp exactly right that was the driver of our first quarter increase in criticized assets about of our criticized assets are in that abl fully conforming were not doing sofrs were within assets so i think the loss content now that said we could have a weakness or welldefined weakness that well work out of but i feel good about the trending that weve seen and for the rest of this year again based on what i know today i would expect stable criticized levels christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for the background i appreciate it fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 operator and well go next to gerard cassidy at rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp welcome back gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you ive got a followup for you talking about loan growth i noticed there was a small uptick in growth in the home equity portfolio i think it was slide you guys show this data timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc whats the opportunity for you because one of your bank of america saw an uptick as well in home equity lending in view of the fact that people are not refinancing their houses because of where rates are but there is a ton of equity in houses have you guys considered looking at this and maybe as an area of potential growth i know that home equity has got a bad reputation from what happened in but obviously and the world is different today but any of your thoughts here timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah i tell people here all the time that the first rule of holes is that you have to stop digging so it is nice after many years of having brackets around the change in balance number for home equity to see a turn of the tide there i would not anticipate that its a big driver of our loan growth over the course of the next few quarters not because we wouldnt like it to be but if you look at the amount of spending in home improvement in general right now just look at the big home improvement retailers youll see that thats a category that remains pretty depressed that said i do think that the right strategy here for homeowners who have these fixed rate mortgages is going to be to improve where they are as opposed to moving and home equity is a great way to do that so we would like to see more growth in home equity we like the credit quality there its going to be slow and steady here in terms of the pickup gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate the color fifth
