evolving so with that lets go ahead and get started we had a strong finish to a tumultuous year with net income of billion and earnings per share of in the fourth quarter we ended with over billion in net income despite the doubling of credit reserves as a result of the pandemic and the impact of cecl overall we increased our acl by billion over the course of the year as a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise our revenues were flat to despite the massive economic impacts of covid19 globally our deposits were up nearly as we supported our clients throughout the year and we see significant franchise value in the growth that were seeing in the deposit base turning to the fourth quarter our institutional clients group performed well as they have throughout the year highlighted by our markets businesses which saw revenues up from the fourth quarter of banking saw a revenue decline as investment banking activity slowed and low rates continued to impact treasury and trade solutions although the private bank was a standout with a increase our consumer banking revenues continued to be impacted by the pandemic although we did see deposit growth in every region citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 in the us our retail business did benefit from exceptionally high mortgage refinancing as homeowners saw opportunities in this ultralowrate environment and we saw continued momentum in digital deposits in mexico lower loan volumes pressured our revenues in asia card spending was down again but we continued to see strong performance in wealth management we remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients our common equity tier ratio increased to well above our regulatory minimum of our tangible book value per share increased to up from a year ago and we welcome the federal reserves decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital we can return to shareholders and we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter given my upcoming retirement from citi at the end of february i recently looked through some of the challenges we faced when i became ceo and while theres always more work to do im very proud of what the firm has accomplished were in a fundamentally different place than we were in october of weve streamlined our consumer business and embraced the shift to digital so we could serve our clients the way they want to be served weve reestablished citi as a goto bank for our institutional clients throughout our global network no matter what part of the world youre in our bankers have a seat at the table during the most significant transactions weve optimized our capital base working through our legacy assets and reducing our dta by more than half generating billion of regulatory capital in the process we dramatically increased the return of our capital to our shareholders we went from a dividend to returning over billion in capital since and weve reduced our share count by before the pandemic we had significantly improved the quality and consistency of our earnings our return on assets and return on our equity as a result of the pandemic while the financial results this year arent what i would have wanted them to be for my last year as ceo in many ways i couldnt be prouder all the work we did to strengthen our firm helped us get through this extraordinary year and im proud of the fact that weve shown we can go through a crisis and emerge even stronger unlike the events of more than a decade ago just for context lets compare to in the year of pandemic we had nearly billion more in net income a basis point higher return on assets and basis points higher return on tangible common equity than we had in that shows you just how far citi has come and we also showed what our firm is about by serving our customers our clients and our communities we were the first bank to launch an accommodation program for consumers when the pandemic hit we stood up a small business program for lending in just a matter of weeks we donated its profits to covid relief efforts part of million in such grants we made throughout the year and in the aftermath of the murder of george floyd we announced billion in strategic actions to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the united states as i said theres always more to do but i feel really good about the firm as jane prepares to take over shes thrown herself into the transformation weve launched to strengthen our risk and control environment and ensure that the firm operates with excellence in every area i know shell do everything she can to maximize returns and move citi forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders with that mark is going to go through the presentation citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you mike and good morning everyone starting on slide citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of billion revenues declined from the prior year while trading remained strong this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of consumer activity expenses were up yearoveryear reflecting continued investment in our transformation including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment along with higher repositioning costs as we look to adjust capacity in targeted areas credit performance remained strong with credit losses of billion down sequentially as well as yearoveryear and cost of credit was roughly neutral for the quarter as these losses were offset by an acl release of billion driven primarily by an improvement in our base macro scenario eps was and rotce was in constant dollars end of period loans declined yearoveryear reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer deposits grew reflecting consistent client engagement with corporate clients building liquidity along with higher savings rates and reduced spending in consumer turning to fullyear results in we delivered solid performance despite the crisis with net income of over billion even as we increased reserves by roughly billion we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and grew tangible book value throughout the year on the top line while the pandemic had a significant impact we held fullyear revenues flat to with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenues expenses increased in line with guidance as we invested in our transformation results also included covid19 related expenses and a civil money penalty in the third quarter offset by lower discretionary spending and continued efficiency savings full year eps also includes a impact related to revising the previously determined accounting for thirdparty collection fees reversing the benefit to net income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings from capitalneutral as of yearend on slide we provide additional detail on reserving action as a reminder these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty which provides for the possibility for a more adverse outcome our reserve release this quarter primarily reflects our improving macroeconomic outlook although i would note we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty as the pace and shape of the recovery is still evolving overall looking at the reserves we hold today we believe that we are wellpositioned with nearly billion in reserves which represents an allowance for credit losses of roughly on funded loans turning now to each business slide shows the results for the institutional clients group for the quarter icg delivered ebt of billion up from last year operating margin declined on lower revenues and a increase in expenses primarily reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls while credit costs were down considerably given a billion acl release the release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global gdp as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio as of quarterend our overall funded reserve ratio was including on the noninvestment grade portion total net credit losses were million looking at fullyear results the icg businesses performed well this year with revenue growth positive operating leverage and operating margin growth of but given the acl build this year icg ebit declined and for the full year icg delivered a return on allocated capital citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 slide shows revenues for the institutional clients group in more detail revenues decreased in the fourth quarter as strong trading performance was offset by lower revenues in tts investment banking and corporate lending on the banking side revenues declined treasury and trade solutions revenues were down as reported and in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues average deposits were up in constant dollars and we had solid growth in our underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdowns with increased digital adoption crossborder transaction volumes growing over and our record quarter in clearing investment banking revenues were down from last year as solid growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenues in ma and debt underwriting private bank revenues grew driven by capital markets strength as well as improved managed investments revenues and higher lending corporate lending revenues were down driven by lower spreads higher hedging costs and lower average volumes total markets securities services revenues increased from last year fixed income revenues grew as higher revenues across spread products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currencies although i would note that we saw solid performance in fx and global rates and good client engagement across the entire business equity revenues were up versus last year driven by strong performance in cash equities derivatives and client finance reflecting higher client volumes and more favorable market conditions and finally in securities services revenues were unchanged on a reported basis but up in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients with growth in deposits settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads for full year revenues increased driven by the significant strength in markets this year along with a solid contribution from investment banking and the private bank throughout the year we continued to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses as we actively helped our clients navigate through this uncertain environment given our global platform our progress in creating new digital solutions and our fullservice model which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise and given the momentum weve seen this year in key drivers including digital adoption deposit growth and client engagement were even better positioned to ensure additional share gains in as these clients more fully recognize the benefits of using citi as their platform of choice turning now to the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars on slide gcb delivered ebit of billion revenues declined as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management were more than offset by lower card volume and lower interest rates across all regions that said we did see signs of stabilization sequentially this quarter expenses increased across both north america and international consumer driven mostly by higher repositioning excluding repositioning costs total gcb expenses were flat as covidrelated costs were largely offset by efficiency savings credit costs decreased as lower volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit losses coupled with an acl reserve release in all three regions and looking at full year results gcb delivered ebit of billion down significantly from last year reflecting the impact of the pandemic and higher reserve build under cecl slide shows the results for north america consumer in more detail total fourth quarter revenues were down from last year but we did see positive momentum in our drivers this quarter and on a sequential basis revenues grew branded cards revenues were down reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 loans purchase sales grew sequentially on both cecl activity as well as a continued recovery in consumer spending but were still down yearoveryear at the same time were seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay so while purchase activity has improved our clients are also paying down more quickly resulting in continued pressure on our loan balances retail services revenues were down yearoveryear reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner fees net interest revenues were down as average loans declined by on lower purchase sales activities and higher payment rates similar to branded cards purchase sales grew sequentially but remained down yearoveryear higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year reflecting the impact of lower losses in and therefore higher income share retail banking revenues were down yearoveryear as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads average deposits were up including growth in checking we saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with digital deposits increasing billion quarter overquarter and we saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with yearover year growth in citigold clients and growth in assets under management overall we feel good about our client engagement as we exit the year with spend activity continuing to recover underlying strength in wealth management drivers and significant deposit growth giving us the opportunity to grow and deepen these relationships going forward as we continue to invest in our products and digital capabilities on slide we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars in asia revenues declined yearoveryear in the fourth quarter we continued to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenue grew with a increase in citigold clients and growth in net new money and average deposit growth remained strong at albeit at lower deposit spreads card revenues remained under pressure yearoveryear with purchase sales down given a continued significant impact on travel in the region however we did see sequential improvement in purchase sales this quarter in line with our expectations turning to latin america total revenues declined yearoveryear similar to other regions we saw good growth in deposits in mexico this quarter with average balances up and purchase sales improved sequentially however deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continued to decline given the macro environment slide provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends credit loss rates generally trended downward this quarter given high levels of liquidity in the us lower spending and the benefits of relief programs however in asia credit loss rates increased mostly driven by those accounts that exited relief programs in line with our expectations the yearoveryear rise in delinquencies outside the us is concentrated in accounts rolling off relief programs and reflects more modest levels of stimulus in these regions relative to the us given these trends we continue to expect peak losses to occur in asia and mexico during the first half of and should begin to recover thereafter meanwhile in the us while we do expect losses to begin to rise in given todays delinquency trends and the expected impact of recent stimulus we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of whether continuing to push out these losses is simply a matter of timing or if it will ultimately result in lower aggregate losses remains to be seen and its something we are watching closely citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 slide shows the results for corporateother revenues declined significantly from last year reflecting the impact of lower rates the winddown of legacy assets and the absence of episodic gains expenses were roughly flat as the winddown of legacy assets offset investments in infrastructure risk management and control and the pretax loss was million this quarter roughly in line with our prior outlook slide shows our net interest revenues and margin trends in constant dollars total net interest revenue of billion this quarter declined billion yearoveryear reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances partially offset by higher tradingrelated nir sequentially net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding markets was roughly flat to the third quarter and net interest margin declined basis points reflecting lower net interest revenue and balance sheet expansion due to strong deposit growth turning to non interest revenues in the fourth quarter nonnir declined to just over billion given lower levels of consumer activity yearoveryear turning to full year results revenues were flat with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher non interest revenues driven by continued strong performance in markets throughout the year as well as strength in investment banking on slide we show our peak capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio increased to or basis points above our regulatory minimum our supplementary leverage ratio was and our tangible book value per share grew by to driven by net income before i hand it back to mike let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for on the top line we saw an extraordinary year in markets performance in and would expect some degree of normalization this year and subject to how that plays out we could see revenues down in the mid to high singledigit range this year largely driven by markets this outlook assumes industry wallets more similar to levels and for net interest revenues specifically it assumes continued stabilization in the first half of the year with an improvement in the back half tied to our base case which assumes loan growth by this point in the recovery on a fullyear basis a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between billion to billion versus on the expense side we expect fullyear expenses to increase in the range of to mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda our cost of credit should be meaningfully lower than and we expect a tax rate of roughly for the year so pulling this together we expect operating margin pressure this year but given lower credit costs we should still see significant improvement in profitability relative to and finally as mike mentioned earlier we look forward to repurchasing shares through the balance of subject to board approval starting this quarter to wrap up as i look at how we performed in we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise we sit here today with strong capital and liquidity position overall client engagement remains strong we grew book value every quarter and we remain focused on supporting colleagues customers clients and communities all of which give me a great deal of confidence as we move into with that let me hand it back to mike michael louis corbat chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mark now id like to turn it over to jane so you can hear from her for a few minutes citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 jane fraser president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc thank you mike and good morning to everyone i want to thank mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition it was important for him to ensure citi has a seamless ceo transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful to me as i prepare to step into the role at the end of february i am extremely excited by the opportunities ahead for our firm and i am equally determined to address the deficiencies in our risk and control environment that have been raised by our regulators weve embarked on a transformation program that will clearly benefit our clients and investors as well as meeting the regulators expectations of one of the worlds most globally significant financial institutions and of course we still have to get through this pandemic while we hope the end is in sight this virus has surprised us and taught us the folly of best laid plans so we will remain vigilant and adaptable my two major priorities as i transition with mike are our transformation efforts and refreshing our strategy so we ultimately achieve three things best position citi to win to improve our returns significantly and to address the issues raised by our regulators while its early days our work on these priorities is well underway so on the transformation were taking the time to step back to tackle the root cause issues to define our target endstate and develop the detailed plans to get us there we put in place specific work streams against risk and controls data and compliance but we also have workstreams on creating a culture of excellence and accountability and on strengthening our critical business processes each stream is led by a member of the executive management team together we are accountable for simplifying and modernizing the bank in february we will deliver our gap analysis to the target state and in may the detailed implementation plan this effort will take time and it will require significant investment in technology and talent you have my commitment that we will invest your capital wisely and that you our clients and our regulators will all see and benefit from the results at the end of the day we want to achieve a state of excellence in our risk and controls in our operations and in our service to clients switching tacks to strategy i have the benefit of having worked in a number of businesses and regions in citi over the last years nonetheless this transition is giving me valuable time to step back and to take a dispassionate look at our strategy and businesses you wouldnt expect me to come out with specifics at this rather early stage but i can talk about how we are looking at this we have a wonderful franchise firstclass capabilities and a terrific brand name we are the worlds most global bank with a network no one can match and this means we are uniquely able to help clients grow and succeed globally our capital and balance sheet are strong we have a deep talent bench around the world so while we have work to do this is a pretty good hand to play a few principles will guide how we refresh the strategy were taking a clinical look at our strategic positioning assessing which businesses can attain leading market positions in a much more digitized world similarly i believe in the value of focus and directing our investments and resources to the businesses that will drive stronger growth and improve returns over the long run i also believe in ensuring the businesses were in fit well together so collectively they are competitively advantaged and generate synergies and finally like any true scot i believe there is value to unlock by simplifying the firm as you know on wednesday we announced that we will integrate consumer wealth management and our private bank into one business line its a growth opportunity im particularly excited about citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 in asia as well as the us earlier in the week we also announced the new head of our tts franchise and our us consumer leadership and i look forward to sharing new opportunities and moves with you as we go i want to end as i began by thanking mike he has spent his 38year career at citi no one has been more dedicated he always put citi first and he took over at a very difficult time he had to make tough calls steering the company through the postcrisis restructuring he made citi a simpler smaller safer and far stronger institution returning it to growth closing the gap with our peers and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders just as he promised he would his steady leadership this year helped us through this very difficult period for all of us but this last year showed how the work he led has strengthened our firm as we supported our people clients and communities through this pandemic he leaves us with a tremendous foundation and i am committed to building on his success we are very grateful to him and proud of him and all of us at citi wish him the very best in the next chapter mike would you like to say something to close michael louis corbat chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jane i appreciate your comments and i know the firm is going to be in great hands jane mark and i are now happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much and thank you mike jane i think its great that you came on so i cant resist asking you one so i agree with you focusing on strong business positioning on its own and then making sure businesses fit well together you came for part of your tenure from latin american consumer side and global consumer id love to get your perspective and thoughts on the question thats come up over the years of how much does global consumer fit well together are they individual business on their own how much can they leverage going forward to be a true global consumer platform thanks so much jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc thanks glenn for your question so we are just beginning the work on the strategy and as i say were taking it a step back and mark and i are working on a dispassionate view of all of the businesses and looking at what are the leading franchises we want to invest behind what are the others that we want to grow to win and as we do that work we will let you know whats the direction were going to be taking as we have done already in the announcements this week on wealth and on the new leadership in tts but i would say let us do the work and then well let you know how everything fits together and if there are pieces that end up not being part of the core well let you know but let us do the work first citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay thats cool maybe ill follow up with a more nittygritty one on the card side i think part of the plans the last couple years has been converting card customers into digital banking clients i noticed in the appendix that theres been growth in customers but there hasnt been a tremendous amount of growth lately in active digital and mobile customers i would say the last five quarters so im curious if that what youre doing to attack that opportunity and if that fits into the going forward plan mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc yes so in terms of the digital customers its a different picture in different parts of the world so we saw tremendous growth in mexico that starts with a much lower digital base and so with covid we saw a pretty rapid acceleration across the industry and were a major leader in that when we look at the states we already have an extremely active card customer base on the digital front and so we werent expecting to see the same levels of pickup id say the other piece as well is customer acquisition across the board is lower because of covid and you typically do tend to see that the new customers when they come onboard anyones platform they tend to have a higher digital adoption rate so i think were pretty optimistic that as and when we see the recovery that well also see growth in that digital adoption in the us going forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey jane the only thing id add to that is that we have been seeing greater estatement penetration or e statement usage i should say and epayment usage our estatement usage and payment usage is up some and so as you would imagine through this crisis people have been actively engaged with our digital capabilities and thats in part a byproduct of the investments that weve been making in digital technology and so we feel good about that operator your next question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mark was wondering if you could unpack some of the drivers of your expense outlook between investment spend maybe the transformation spend and where youre saving money mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so look as ive said in the outlook there we see expenses being up about to most of that is likely to be driven by the transformation spend as we get our arms around what that cost is going to be you know already weve spent billion this year thats in our run rate already but there is a broader investment strategy that were working towards and were doing that in the context of well obviously do that in the context of how the strategy jane spoke to evolves and so continued investment in digital citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 capabilities both on the consumer side as you heard me mention but also on the icg side particularly in our tts platform where weve seen good benefits from the investments already made there but as you know thats an area where innovation in technology is whats required to maintain a competitive advantage there we just announced the wealth management business if you will bringing together wealth and the consumer and in the private bank and that i would imagine would be not i would imagine that will be an area of investment for us as we grow fee revenues as jane has pointed to as an important objective of ours well also see growth in advertising and marketing so in that outlook i talked about net interest revenue stabilizing but picking up in the back half of the year with growth in loans and that growth in loans is going to be a byproduct of us starting to put money to work again back in advertising and marketing which was down materially this year as we managed through this crisis so those are a couple of areas that we would look to invest in in the context of that to but again a lot of it is going to be towards this transformation and it is an investment which i continue to remind folks of and that is to say that we expect to and will focus on ensuring that we get a payback on that in the coming years and so hopefully that gives you a good sense john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research no thats helpful and just to follow up on the net interest income outlook you mentioned i think you said it could be down billion to billion on a yearoveryear basis what are the swing factors that would bring into the low end of that versus the high end of that thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so again the net interest revenue could be down and thats in part because you got to look at the pace of the recovery that were forecasting and so how loan volumes trend will be an important factor there obviously the gdp forecast that we have factors into that and then obviously the rate curve and how that evolves will be another important factor that comes into play that said i would add that we have seen on the card side you heard me mention this in my prepared remarks we saw good sequential momentum across purchase sale activity some of thats seasonal but some of that just really good activity with our customers and were looking for that to continue obviously theres been a stimulus thats been announced already there are certain talks of a significant stimulus or additional stimulus to come and hopefully that kind of bridges us to a place where it fuels some of the gdp growth that were seeing in our forecast operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning my first question is for jane like glenn i cant resist i think investors are very excited to hear about your strategic plans because the constructive criticism that i get on citi is that i think that investors are onboard with your current plans on remediation and recovery but i think they continue to wonder whether you have a lot of breadth but not as much depth in terms of market share and businesses and its a longwinded way to ask this question im sorry your peers seem to be settling on a midteens rotce or a little bit higher on a citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 normalized level and as you think about the wonderful franchise that you already have and the opportunities that you have to improve upon it do you think that citi can get to that level eventually whenever that normalized period arrives jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc its a great question its one weve been spending a lot of time working on and talking through as mark and i look at what is the right configuration of businesses how do we as ive said in the principles were laying out for how were looking at the citi of the future particularly in a digital environment the world is changing quite quickly on that front so once we finished doing the work well be laying out what are the different metrics and milestones to measure us both in terms of progress and in terms of the desired outcomes ive been im talking to a number of our key investors which have been great very helpful conversations over the last few weeks and getting input from them around what sorts of outcomes are desirable and theyre very much part of mix as we look at doing this work on the strategy and on the transformation as mark said the two go hand in hand going forward so we look forward to getting back to you with that picture when were ready and mark i know has been key in all of this so let me pass the mic to him mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks jane look in your prepared remarks you rightfully focus on strategies that are geared towards identifying growth opportunities and improving our returns and narrowing the gap to peers and i think that type of strategic focus along with the investments that were making both transformation and growthoriented investments will certainly put us on that path i think the normalization of gdp and the credit environment is going to be helpful as well and then as many people know weve got a deferred tax asset and some legacy assets that well continue to work down over time and i think those the combination of those things starting with the strategy and a plan to continue to return capital and return on capital put us in the right path to getting to those improved levels of returns not to mention the prospect of increasing rates over time or in a normal part of the cycle erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc thank you for that and my followup question is for you mark it seems as if the stimulus plan so far and potentially the additional stimulus could build a bridge thats strong enough and long enough to perhaps not delay losses but lower actual cycle losses in card how should we think about the stimulus related to how that could impact spending and loan volume trends as we trace that back to that nii guide mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look i mean when we think about our reserve levels and the activity there we certainly did factor in the impact of stimulus i think whats important to point to is the stimulus thus far has resulted in high payment rates and a consistent kind of ability to pay for the consumer and thats been good and it showed up not only in our payment rates but it also shows up in the lower level of delinquencies that weve seen and obviously the lower level of losses that weve seen there certainly is a need for additional stimulus and i think the good thing about that is it citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 should continue to support the payment rates that weve seen and if it is significant enough can ultimately drive greater consumption and support improved gdp improved unemployment our current forecast as you heard me mention earlier assumes that that loan momentum picks up towards the end or the im sorry the back half of if we see that take hold sooner we could see higher levels of volume and loan growth and obviously that would be beneficial to our nir forecast so stimulus is good in that regard it also will as it takes hold there will likely be some early pressure on lending volumes because people tend are using it as a liquidity tool and to pay down but over time i think it will be beneficial operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi one simple question and one hard question mark you get the simple one when can citigroup start repurchasing shares and how much do you think you can repurchase in the first quarter and i dont think you were allowed to purchase yet this quarter but did you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so as you know the fed guidance allowed for us to reinstate buybacks there was a cap on the first quarter thats based on the trailing fourquarter average of income for us that would equate to about billion or so in buybacks in the first quarter and so subject to board approval we will approve some level of buybacks in q1 we have not started those buybacks as of yet mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right and then the hard question is for jane is who does citi want to be in when we step back or years from now and have a picture of citi and the reason i ask that is you mentioned citi being global but despite this global status citis fallen short of expectations in each of the past five decades you can go back to walter wriston you can go back to the you can go back to sandy weill and john reed the financial supermarket you can go back to the financial crisis and even with the retrenching and derisking and i agree the chance of bankruptcy is far less the return on capital has fallen short of the cost of capital for the last decade so youll be the seventh ceo at citigroup when you take over why will it be different this time what can you do differently whether its business mix or customer mix or geographic mix because from my perspective and i its great youre going to take a clinical use a dispassionate look im extremely passionate about the underperformance of citi over almost any timeframe over the last years and so im just trying to figure out what you can do given your years at citi your experience at mckinsey to actually finally change citi to generate sustainable returns above the cost of capital so once again whats citis endgame thank you jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc well thank you mike so i think the endgame and you asked a question if terms of what do we look like in its pretty simple really as you said were a global bank we want to be the leading global bank were very well positioned from that from our businesses that means top tier franchises in their respective competitive sets with a strategy that has been well understood by the markets over that timeframe we want to be bestinclass in citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 serving our clients and our customers certainly in safety and soundness and id add in we want to be seen as playing a positive role in society as i think thats a very important part of mix these days but all of that is with a purpose of generating the desired returns for our investors so to be fair while we have made demonstrable progress over the last years since the crisis ph equally know that there is a gap to close with our peers you can hold me accountable for doing so along with the management team were a team on a mission to get this done and we will get this done operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global securities james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities not to beat a dead horse maybe just one quick followup if theres any help you can give us i think one of the biggest concerns on investors is they cant see the path to the kind of peer level returns do you think of it as you look at it without giving away specifics on strategy and things like that is it really an efficiency issue is it a capital issue because of the dtas how do you think about where you are today and whats driving the gap jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc so these are all the questions that mark and i are sitting down and looking at our different businesses and saying how do we make sure as i said in the opening remarks were looking at how do we drive our resource allocation and how do we drive our investments into businesses that will be important growth drivers for the franchise and highreturning areas for the firm going forward weve come out with one already that we thinks an important one on that dimension in wealth where weve got many different parts of the puzzle that we think will enable us to be highly successful in this domain bringing the different pieces of the firm together to drive this forward and is clearly going to be one of several areas that we see helping us improve our returns and as mike said thats not the only piece there are other elements as i said in the different principles we see value from simplification and thats in terms of obviously the operating efficiencies and the like that we will get from that as well as potentially business mix and we want to drive the businesses to make sure that theyre really fitting well together so that they are achieving the synergies as well as the competitive and collective comparative advantage so its going to be a combination of pieces but as i say were doing this work well let you know as we go of what the decisions we make along the way and look forward to sharing them with you frankly with the intent that we have both a leading global firm as well as an organization thats delivering the desired results to our investors mark anything to add my friend citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think you said it well but i want to repeat one thing you said which is that were going to get this done right and it is a combination well continue to refine the strategy here weve got some very strong businesses with competitive advantages that we want to continue to shore up were going to make investments in the franchise because thats what its going to take in order to continue to drive improved returns yes there are some drags i mentioned that earlier they certainly do weigh on the returns between the dta and legacy assets but we also have excess capital as we sit here with the cet1 ratio of an versus target that we have and so were going to continue work all of those things in combination and i believe those are the things we believe those are the things that are going to get us back to continued improved levels of returns that we saw coming into this crisis james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay fair enough and maybe just speaking to one of those businesses where you see growth youve been investing can you talk to the underlying obviously with pressure on interest rates its hard to see it the underlying growth in tts how you feel about the business as weve seen competition whether its in treasury services or payments wholesale payments it seems like its a competitive environment how do you think about that business and growth from here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes sure ill take that so first of all we feel very good about the tts business that we have we think of it as part of our services business inside of the icg services would include tts and security services as you know we have a very unique position within this part of our franchise and youre right the headline numbers are affected by interest rates but we feel very good about the underlying momentum in the business and we think thats evidenced by a couple of key drivers youre aware were in countries that gives our clients the ability to transact in over currencies and we do that on a global platform we have users on that platform which is up about from last year and within that the mobile users are up about were continuing to grow accounts with our clients and we now have the ability to open accounts digitally in countries in we opened over accounts digitally representing more than a increase and growing accounts deepens our relationship with clients and allows us to penetrate new activity centers that allows us to capture more flows across our platform and ultimately that delivers more revenue and so this digital activity drives revenue for us in the future and it also is a more efficient way for us to do business with clients were also seeing good transaction volumes across different payment types with these clients weve had very good clearing performance and crossborder flows through the year and so those things give us a lot of insight into what the momentum will look like coming out of this crisis and thats not to mention additional opportunities with new clients as you know weve moved our commercial business squarely into the icg theres more upside for our tts platform with the commercial client base and so we feel very good about where we are were not taking our position for granted were going to continue to invest in this platform and were looking forward to capturing the growth and supporting our clients as they come out of this crisis operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i want to follow up on expenses so the guidance implies about billion this year and as you alluded to a lot of investments in that as we think out its all hypothetical because there might be changes to the strategy and simplification that can impact the expense base but as we think out beyond this year should we view that as kind of a bloated expense base that some of these investments are running at higher than normal levels and you can bring them down or is this more of kind of a normal run rate and then the efficiency will really come from growing revenue mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me make a couple quick comments one as i mentioned and as you repeated we will see expense growth here jane mentioned were in the midst of making progress against our transformation and well need to submit a plan in may and get that plan approved and continue to invest to get that executed against and that will inform the thinking around some of the outer years but to answer your question around a bloated expense base i would say no its not a bloated expense base at all these are investments as you heard me mention repeatedly and there is going to be a return on the investment the return will come in both revenue and a more efficient operating platform weve got a history now weve got some credibility now with having demonstrated productivity across our platform whether thats through automating processes or reducing data centers or low cost location strategies since our investor day weve continued to improve our productivity and thats what you should expect thats what were expecting of ourselves and will deliver on kind of coming out of these investments that we need to make and so no not a bloated expense base with that said so put that aside we are going to continue to invest in the business and so if there are opportunities that present themselves either as a byproduct of the strategy refresh that jane has mentioned or otherwise we intend to take advantage of making those investments because that is the only way we get to those improved returns that were targeting and focused on so hopefully that answers your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc that is helpful and then just separately as we think about the strategic review i think theres been some speculation in terms of which businesses if any you might exit and im not going to name them but some of them are pretty high return businesses if you just look at them on a standalone basis some arent but how do you think conceptually about as you potentially exit or sell a certain business there might be a gap between youre giving up some earnings before you can deploy them in things like digital and tts and wealth in terms of the payback right because there could be you lose some earnings initially and you might have bloated capital and again some investments take time to play out so is that something that youre mindful of or jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc yes what were looking at the moment is much more around what do we want to be going forward and where we are in the work is looking at how what are the different businesses how do they best fit together digitization is changing quite a few things as mark was referring to its providing a lot of new opportunities but also some important investments for growth as well as for returns and if it ends up that there are businesses we look at it that we dont think that fit well into the mix then i think weve got good skills in terms of thinking about how we citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 divest of those in a way that makes sense but thats honestly not where we are at the moment were focused on what were going to be so as i say wait for it to get the work done and then we can come back to you with the plans of what were looking at and what that path looks like i think its too early to speculate right now operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one on the improving profitability that weve been talking about here i know weve been talking a lot about it from the expense side and from the revenue growth side but im also wondering about the funding cost side and given the fact that you have a great brand in the us you have a really good mobile app and we have a relatively low interest rate environment why not put up a highcost savings product and reduce your wholesale cost of funds by switching from wholesale to a highcost savings product which at this rate you can actually you should be able to pick up some roa on that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look we have seen very good deposit growth and some of that is a byproduct of our highyield savings accounts but weve also seen strong checking account growth this quarter and weve seen the growth in our digital deposits as well and so youre right theres a funding cost advantage to that weve seen that play out in the liquidity thats in the market we intend to continue to grow as it relates to increasing those deposits and weve been smart about how weve been managing our liquidity keeping some liquidity obviously there for lending needs as they may evolve for our customers and clients but also paying down wholesale debt we did that through the year and also investing weve made some investments through the year i think weve invested as much as another billion or so up for the year and so weve been thoughtfully managing the liquidity that weve seen through the course of this year well continue to do that and well continue to grow deposits on the consumer side because youre right it is a lower cost funding alternative and well do that indiscernible makes a lot of sense betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the other question for you mark is just on how youre thinking about credit i know you mentioned that credit costs will be lower in versus i think we all agree with that trying to understand how much flex there is there maybe one question there is on the reserve analysis and what kind of level of unemployment youre looking for and youre reserving today at yearend and is there some room for that reserve relief to be potentially larger as we go through the year and then maybe i know you talked about how stimulus could help net charge citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 offs peak so its hard to give an estimate on that but maybe give us a sense as to how youre thinking about the trajectory for credit costs year on year thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so i guess a couple of pieces there so one as you know betsy when we model this we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time and so you look at kind of page we laid out the variables that weve used this quarter and you can see that both for us unemployment as well as for us real gdp weve seen improvement since the third quarter forecast that we ran and id tell you even as you look at this theres been further improvement even off of the fourth quarter forecast thats here and so those are important factors in the assumptions and what were able to model in the way of reserve levels and as we see that improve or improve further we would expect that that would be that would play out in the way of even lower reserves i think the other important factor is the stimulus and how that and the additional stimulus that is out there and how that ultimately evolves and what that means and whether that drives consumer consumption and whether that drives even further levels of improved unemployment will be important factors that come into play here and then i guess the final piece id mention is that we continue to hold management adjustment for economic uncertainty and as we see these variables continue to improve thats going to impact how we think about severity and probability associated with that downside scenario so all of those factors come into play as to how we think about the reserve levels that we carry while we still feel good about the billion roughly that we have in the way of balances we feel very good about the direction that these economic variables appear to be moving in terms of losses again its been interesting the way this has played out and so really what were all trying to figure out is whether the lower delinquencies and lower level of losses that weve seen thus far is a delay or is it a deflation of losses right and that only time will tell as we sit here today and as you heard me say in my prepared remarks we think its a bit of a delay in that we would expect to see losses peak in now particularly for us consumer but again with another stimulus right around the corner that in fact could be further delayed and ultimately we would hope that it would just go away and be deflated and come down so operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey good morning a followup question mark on the fee side understanding that well see this tough comp yearoveryear just wondering if you can separate when you expect normalization for some of the areas back to 2019ish i know thats a moving target given the environment but just if you think about separating out trading and investment banking can you just think talk to us about the visibility stuff that you see a little bit more easier how you see that trajecting notably investment banking tts et cetera mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes so again we see we continue to have good dialogue on the investment banking side with our clients obviously weve seen very strong performance as it relates to the spac space and equity capital markets and that will continue to play out just when you think about the nature of those deals and so that will continue to play citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 out into but the dialogues been very good and thats both in investment banking but also just broadly with the corporate clients as corporate clients are trying to figure out what coming out of this crisis means for their own business models and how they think about their digital capabilities and needs and how they think about their supply chains and how that might be shifting and those types of dialogues theyre having both internally but also with us and so were part of that conversation and being part of that creates opportunities on the tts side on the investment banking side and potentially even as it relates to the corporate lending activity which we hope to pick up in the back half of the year as well and so very strong and continued corporate dialogue and i think thats going to contribute ultimately to driving some of that fee revenue that you mentioned in terms of the markets piece again weve had an extraordinary year the industry has seen a great deal of wallet growth in markets and thats got to normalize at some point obviously and we are forecasting that it does but ill tell you in the early days of january weve continued to see robust activity and it is early days in the quarter but we have seen that and so well have to see how that plays out over the balance of the quarter and going into the balance of ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood and ill follow up on rates its always a little harder to dig out how much rates benefits you guys just given the global nature of all the yield curves that you guys face but is there a way you can help us or just remind us how sensitive or not the company is to just if the long end were to move here in the us and how much contribution that might be able to add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look we tend to be more sensitive to the short end of the curve but we disclosed some ire information in our qs and in fairness thats kind of tough to compare relative to peers so we show what basis point increase would be on the long end and but the reality is that we would see with curves steepening we would see some upside as we would think about investing out on the curve and as it would also impact the pressure weve been seeing from mbs repayments and the like and so were more sensitive to the short but with a steepening we think we would see some benefit operator your next question is from the line of chris kotowski with oppenheimer chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning thank you im looking at page of your handout on the global consumer trends im trying to understand that and i guess i have two questions one narrow one broader and the narrow question is just looking at latin america the losses are down and the delinquencies are significantly up is that an accounting thing a forbearance thing or is that a real underlying economic thing and does it have to do with covid or does it have to do with other economic variables mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look what were seeing there is as people come off of the relief programs that have been in place were seeing delinquencies pick up as was expected and so thats whats playing out in the increase that we see in the fourth citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 quarter and ultimately that will play out in the ncls but again that is along the lines of what we were expecting in latin america chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay and the decline then presumably is the flipside of that the forbearance mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thats right chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc right okay and then i guess just looking at the picture more broadly i mean i guess if you look at infection rates of covid north america is high asia is low and latin america is somewhere in between normally i think all of us like or months ago would have thought that the economic disruption and the loss rates would somehow mirror that and it doesnt seem to be in any way shape or form that i can tell and im wondering if you can account for that and how are we to gauge kind of the disruption that covid is causing and i guess particularly in your kind of global businesses michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc go ahead im sorry michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc mark i was going to say chris i would say that weve got to look at what i would describe as the unevenness right the unevenness the way that we went into this in terms of timing in terms of position in terms of health response in terms of economic response you look at the demographics and clearly in at the different layers or different strata you see different things headlines in the paper this morning one out of every five in new york city on rent subsidy are behind in their payments at least two payments but at the same time we continue to see paydowns in terms of credit cards businesses on different trajectories and so again as i think as we see vaccines roll out on a statebystate basis that will cause different outcomes and then as we see the second round and what presidentelect biden announced last night and ultimately what comes through and how that makes its way into the sector so from our perspective not just in the us but around the globe we are really taking a very granular approach on a geographic by geographic client segment by client segment around that and trying to remain very sensitive to each of those and so i dont think there is a single formula that allows you to look at this and come with the outcome its got to be done at a pretty granular level operator your next question is from the line of ph charles peabody with portales citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 q yeah i had a followup question on the markets commentary or trading businesses and specifically i wanted to focus on your ficc trading businesses can you give us a little bit more color as it relates to the fourth quarter where the strength in ficc was and where the weakness was in terms of rates credit commodities currencies and then as part of that its my understanding that you were caught wrongfooted in the rand and i was wondering and im assuming that losses there were not material because its not a deep market but is there something changing about the environment thats going to make it more difficult in for positioning or market making or trading because you do talk about normalizing was there anything in that rand experience that you can extrapolate mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure this is mark sorry mike go ahead michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah first off ph charles i would say that in the rand piece that that was more of a research recommendation than an actually firm a firm positioning play and so it was our analysts going out with what they believed was a recommendation around that and so that shouldnt be read as the firm necessarily having that position independent research came out with that on your second piece i think as you look at ficc trading for us if you look at the fourth quarter and the numbers that weve posted i think you should look in there i think relative strength in terms of credit and credit spread products again as we measure that against our rates and currencies business its not as large its still a meaningful business for us but not as large some of that other people have spoken to as having outsized or quite significant returns in the leveraged lending space were not as large in that space and i think as we look at our trading revenues we tend to look at those over not just quarter but longer cycles and if you look at the street research today its indicating that the trading wallet for was up somewhere in the neighborhood of mid as you look at our trading revenues for were probably up somewhere in the mid so again quartertoquarter less important but again for us continuing to take share in there and the underlying mix tends to kind of bounce that around a little bit but again i think we feel pretty good about our position and the dialogues where we are i think as we think forward i think its unlikely to think that were going to see wallets up to the same degree certainly in the trading space that we saw this year we think seasonality will resume but as mark said as we kind of started and its early in the new year we have seen activity remain high and as i think we see more potential stimulus or governmental programs coming out the fed and others continuing to take stances on rates and trajectory and where things go that could keep trading volumes relatively high so again we think were pretty well positioned and were in dialogue around those but we clearly cant escape all of the market dynamics of where the wallets go mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 and mike the only thing i would add is if you look at the numbers right ficc is up for the year rates and currencies up spread products up weve had very strong performance this year its hard to be upset with those numbers and so everything you said is exactly right mike and i think the business has been fully engaged with clients and were going to continue to do that q just as a follow up i recognize it was an unusually strong year particularly in ficc which was nice to see but does that make it when you look out at are you looking for ficc to be less robust and equity sort of offset that or is there any mix between ficc and equity in your thought process mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look our equities was up were up this year as well right so the normal and the wallets were up for equities as well so well see a normalization take place across the board next year at some point michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i would also say ph charles we need to look at the new issue calendar and clearly the calendar on both the debt and the equity side was strong we saw the seasonality and we saw clearly debt issuance slow in the fourth quarter our recommendation and the uptake around our clients was to go ahead and to build lots of liquidity and to shore up the balance sheet and so probably less debt financing needs in terms of but at the same time ive got to say and i reviewed it last evening that the equity calendar remains very strong and again well see what the markets afford but weve got to be able to have a market thats welcoming to new issues and in particular the spac space which weve excelled in has been strong and so again that will also i think then dictate some of the secondary activity as we go forward in the year operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good afternoon mark and everyone mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark coming back to share repurchases obviously theres limitations based on income and you explained it very clearly for you and also your peers if those limitations are lifted possibly after this years stress test and we go back to the more traditional or the regulations that are in place that went into effect october with the stress capital buffer where as long as you pass your cet1 requirement youre free to do whatever youd like that at the backdrop would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program if you got the green light rather than doing it every quarter like it was done in the past because thats what the regulations required in the past citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah well need to look at first of all the stress capital buffer obviously is an important component to how this all comes together and coming out of the recent resubmission you saw the prospective stress capital buffer go up by basis points they havent applied that were still subject to the stress capital buffer but that will be a factor that we have to consider in the outer quarters from and then post that there will be another ccar submission and well get results that inform the goforward there every quarter well look at what our projected performance would suggest including that stress capital buffer juxtaposed against our target and that that view will allow for us to take the capital actions that we think are appropriate inside of what those results would suggest and so we will take this in quarterly decisions so to speak ensuring that our outlook supports the capital actions that we want to take and so thats how we intend to approach it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and jane you pointed out that a lot of work is going to be done about looking at the opportunities to drive growth for citigroup so that you can narrow the gap between your peers in terms of profitability and i dont expect you to give us answers obviously on this call but one of the differences between citigroup and two of its biggest peers that are more profitable is your us consumer banking franchise and those two peers one of which announced their numbers today have roes in that business of over whereas when we look at your global consumer business based on your fourth quarter numbers the roe was about is there an opportunity for depository acquisitions in the united states is there an opportunity to grow the consumer banking business in the us jane fraser a president chief executive officerglobal consumer banking director chief executive officerelect citigroup inc we certainly believe there is a strong opportunity and the strategy we have as we put all of the us consumer business together over the last year or so has been to make sure that we capitalize on that by holding out and deepening our customer relationships in the us and weve had a number of important ph thrusts digitally and digital acquisition as mark referred to so yes we do see important growth opportunities and our home market is an important one for us the specifics of that as we said more to come operator your next question is from the line of andrew lim with société générale andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi thanks for taking my questions so mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 for the system thanks for the system as a whole weve seen excess deposits really accrue quite a lot at banks i think one of your competitors has noted how this is putting pressure on certain ratios one of which would be your supplementary leverage ratio and i think if you took away the temporary exclusion of cash and treasuries from its denominator of that ratio things would look quite tight i just want to see how that pans out for citi whether you see that same kind of pressure and how you think about that and then if i could ask two short technical questions i didnt quite catch what you said about latam ncls coming down what was the reason for that it just strikes me as a bit surprising that that should be the case and then just lastly on your riskweighted assets they climbed quite a bit this quarter doesnt seem to me that it could be entirely creditdriven just if you could give a bit more color on that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure let me start with your first question which was on i think the impact of deposits and so yes we have seen a significant increase in deposits that does impact a number of the important metrics from an slr point of view if not for the relief which kind of goes away at the end of the first quarter wed have lower slr by basis points so the reg relief provided basis points of relief there it also has had an impact on and by the way we are managing to that slr relief going away at the end of the first quarter so were aware of that were managing accordingly to that its also had an impact on our gsib score which has kind of tripped into the next bucket the bucket and the large percentage of that increase that weve seen in the gsib score was also driven by deposits and so well have to manage that as well obviously we have a view that some consideration needs to be given to both of these metrics as the fed has been clear in terms of their view that there is enough capital in the system and so were hopeful that as kind of things evolve that some consideration is given to that but in the meantime were managing the balance sheet and deposits and capital accordingly and with a full knowledge of how the relief might evolve in the case of the slr in terms of your question on credit risk in latin america the point that i was making here was that because weve had customers that were part of a relief program that the ncls that weve seen have been lower than what they would have been if those customers were not running through the relief program so you see the ncl the lower ncl in the quarter but you also start to see delinquencies pick up and those delinquencies are picking up as people come out of that relief program and start to or stop paying i should say and therefore you see delinquencies tick up and so shortly youll see the ncls start to pick up as people go beyond the days past due delinquent and go into losses hopefully that was clear the last question you asked was on advanced rwa growth and we did see rwa increase quarteroverquarter the drivers there was they were a combination of credit risk market risk and operational risk and inside of that we saw fx drive some of that increase as well as derivatives and mostly derivative and fx exposure increases including cva so those were the major drivers of the rwa on an advanced basis tickup that we saw operator as a reminder youre limited to one question your final question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 hi thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc for taking my good morning thank you for taking my question i just have a quick clarification i know youve been talking about wealth management being a focus and we see the stats that you give us for asia like investment sales up linkedquarter but the fee revenue in asia consumer is actually down linked quarter by so is this a really small business in revenues since theres no disclosure its hard for us to tell or what are the other offsets because i hear you talk about it as a material part of asia but theres no way to put any context around this mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes and look were going to we just announced obviously the creation of this wealth management business where well bring the private bank together with the wealth management business we have globally on consumer so well provide more detailed metrics as it relates to that but our asia wealth management is a sizable business and we are going to continue or expect us to continue to see growth there and so stay tuned on kind of more disclosure there and more details around the strategy for how we get after that operator there are no further questions are there any closing remarks elizabeth lynn managing director head of investor relations citigroup inc thank you
