centered on supporting customers banking where and when they want and meeting them through their preferred channel as part of that strategy we are continually optimizing our distribution network we will be consolidating branches in the first quarter of equal to of the combined branch network and these are in addition to the branch closures announced as part of the tcf transaction importantly we will continue to retain the number one share of branches in both ohio and michigan in addition to branch consolidations we are continuing to diligently optimize roles and resources within the bank were committed to delivering positive operating leverage as we did annually for a decade leading up to finally on the capital front we accelerated our share repurchase in the quarter as well as announced an increase to the quarterly dividend these actions demonstrate our confidence in the performance and outlook for huntington as well as our commitment to our shareholders to actively manage our capital levels slide provides an update on the tcf integration when we announced the transaction we saw strong potential for expense synergies as we leverage the benefits of scale but to also drive additional organic growth and today i can say that weve been more excited about the revenue opportunities in front of us the combination of new growth markets and increased density the addition of more than one and a half million customers and expanded specialty capabilities collectively set up our future revenue growth let me share a couple of the most compelling aspects in middle market and in corporate banking were now bringing greater scale in chicago milwaukee in addition to new capabilities in the twin cities and denver with expanded coverage and product offerings were already gaining traction with early wins including capital markets and treasury management fees in consumer and business banking were deploying huntingtons capabilities products and services across the entire

improve retention and with huntingtons digital and competitive product set we will deepen our customer relationships additionally we are bringing awardwinning sba lending platform and growing our wealth and private banking customer base in our newly expanded markets our investments are well timed as were seeing continued robust economic recovery in our footprint our regions have seen economic activity expand yeartodate faster than the national average as well as higher labor force participation we see a unique moment in time to capitalize on huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 these revenue opportunities as our local economies continue to perform very well we are entering a new era at huntington with momentum and we look forward to growth in the years ahead zach over to you provide more details on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone turning to slide we reported gaap earnings per common share of for the third quarter which included acquisition expenses of million earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for the acquisitionrelated notable items rotce was as we expected and consistent with guidance we provided in september we were pleased to see loan balances ex ppp grow in the third quarter driven by robust new production with continued strong liquidity were actively managing the balance sheet and have grown the securities portfolio by billion from the end of the second quarter deposit balances were reduced by million as a result of the branch divestiture excluding the divestiture deposit balances remained relatively stable on a periodend basis loans associated with the divestiture totaled million fee income was another bright spot where we saw continued momentum in our capital markets cards and payments treasury management and wealth and investment businesses as steve noted weve been actively managing our capital and were pleased to complete million of share repurchases in the third quarter we also announced a increase to the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter which takes us to an annualized dividend rate of per share finally credit quality continued to improve with net chargeoffs of basis points while nonperforming assets decreased to from the prior quarter turning to slide periodend loan balances totaled billion excluding ppp loan balances increased by million during the quarter with underlying growth in ci mortgage auto and rvmarine portfolios on the commercial side while ppp and auto dealer floor plan balances were lower all other ci loans increased by net million during the quarter driven by growth in asset finance and core ci were seeing very encouraging trends from new commercial loan production and pipelines that continue to grow both yearoveryear and sequentially consumer growth was somewhat offset by marginal pressure from the continued run off of the home equity portfolio additionally we continued to observe solid activity levels in our consumer portfolios with residential mortgage rvmarine and automobile all continuing to post sequential quarter balance growth auto saw its strongest third quarter for production activity todate while mortgage continued to see robust origination activity in the quarter excluding ppp we believe the trough for underlying loan balances is behind us and we expect continued modest growth from these levels in the fourth quarter with respect to commercial portfolio specifically we expect to see momentum accelerate as we move through the fourth quarter and throughout moving on to slide as noted previously total deposit balances excluding the divestiture were relatively stable we continue to optimize funding given our strong liquidity levels and reduced higher cost cds by million overall we continued to see much of the excess liquidity remain fairly sticky as core commercial deposit balances increased during the quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 turning to slide fte net interest income increased primarily driven by the fullquarter benefit of tcf net interest income increased by million while net interest margin was both driven by the acquired tcf assets excess liquidity moderated slightly during the quarter with billion of cash at the fed at quarter end on an average basis for the quarter excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately basis points core interest income excluding ppp and accretion was million we expect core net interest income to grow from these levels on an absolute dollar basis in the fourth quarter and throughout were positioned to be asset sensitive today and we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to become increasingly asset sensitive to capture the benefit from expected future higher interest rates this includes the heads rolloffs as well as the addition of pay fixed swaps on june our modeled net interest income asset sensitivity in an up basis points scenario was based on the deliberate actions we took during the quarter we increased our asset sensitivity to and we continue to dynamically manage the balance sheet going forward over the course of the quarter we terminated select downside rate protection hedges and added billion of forward pay fixed swaps turning to slide noninterest income increased primarily driven by the addition of tcf fee income several of our businesses performed quite well within the quarter cards and payments benefited from higher customer transaction volumes mortgage banking performed well due to higher production and relatively higher saleable spreads and wealth and investment continued to be driven by positive net asset flows capital markets income also grew driven by solid performance in interest rate derivatives foreign exchange and syndications turning to slide total noninterest expense came in at approximately billion for the quarter including the million of notable items excluding these items noninterest expense totaled billion primarily driven by the full quarter of tcf expenses our overall outlook for the magnitude of expense reductions is unchanged from prior guidance the timing to realize these benefits however has accelerated due to our actions to drive realization of cost savings as a result we continue to expect that while q3 was the high watermark for core expenses we should benefit earlier than we previously thought as they stepped down into the fourth and first quarters core expenses on an absolute dollar basis should trail down throughout as we recognize the benefits of the tcf cost synergies while continuing to invest in the initiatives that drive top line revenue growth slide highlights our well capitalized balance sheet as well as a few highlights from the recent capital return actions common equity tier ended the quarter at well within our medium term to operating guideline over the past quarter we focused on returning capital to our shareholders in alignment with our capital priorities we executed over half of the million share repurchase program following the authorization as they noted and we are pleased to have recently announced an increase to the common stock dividend as you can see on slide our quarterending allowance for credit losses represented of total loans down from at prior quarter end the improved economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of million for the third quarter additional key credit quality metrics are shown on slide further reflecting our improving credit profile net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases most of the lowest levels in recent history well below our target range of basis points to basis points on average through the cycle consumer chargeoffs remained low in this quarter of basis points with net recoveries in auto home equity rv huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 and marine our npa ratio declined as portfolios continue to perform as expected and the acl coverage of npas increased to finally turning to our outlook on slide as we operate in a dynamic macroenvironment were focused on managing what we can control we remain committed to investing in our peoplefirst digitallypowered strategy driving sustained revenue growth while managing expenses within our longterm commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a return on tangible common equity we expect a peer group leading efficiency ratio and a normalized effective tax rate of to we believe these key metrics revenue growth return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders now let me turn it back over to tim so we can get your questions timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thank you zach well now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions they can add themselves back into the queue thank you operator lets open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys hey thanks for taking the question zach i was hoping maybe there might be a way to put sort of a finer point on the degree to which you might expect costs to come down in future quarters from this quarters roughly billion core base you of course mentioned the acceleration just trying to get a sense for sort of the core investment spending minus the cost saves and then along the lines of acceleration sort of when do we think that cost savings will be baked into the results zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah thanks scott great question overall as i noted in my prepared remarks just really really pleased with our delivery of the cost synergies and the trajectory and im not going to give you specific guidance but i would say that we do expect sequential reduction each quarter and for the next couple of quarters for that to be a larger amount in the doubledigit millions is likely the level you could think about but in the end what i would point you to is the overall expense guidance that ive given which is net of the cost synergies and the investments that were making to selffund those revenue synergy investments and to generally drive the revenue growth huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 across the business so slightly more frontloaded driving sequential growth throughout the balance of the next five quarters r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then maybe switching gears just a bit you sound pretty constructive on overall lending momentum i was curious if you could maybe let us know sort of how that translates into aggregate sort of an aggregate outlook for exppp loan growth i think previously you guys have been saying underlying loans kind of flattish through the remainder of the year and then they grow thereafter does the more constructive tone suggest maybe we get a little more growth sooner zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question let me elaborate a bit more i think as we talked at the barclays investor conference in september i noted i expect to see some modest growth between then and the end of q3 and thats ultimately what we deliver and were really pleased with that i would characterize the growth were expecting for q4 as well to be modest so we do expect growth likely modest i think its really driven by the continuation of the factors weve seen over the last several quarters and we noted a bit in the prepared remarks that is really strong calling activity and pipelines driving continued robust new production in commercial and quite a bit of momentum in business banking and then in the consumer space continued strength in residential mortgage and auto and rvmarine continued to perform pretty well also the other thing i would say is now that we have the conversion behind us that weve got were able to now focus thousands of colleagues on growth and so we do expect the modest growth as we go into q4 and then continuing and frankly accelerating as we go out throughout the course of next year as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc first i wanted to follow up zach on the expense question so you talked about the core in terms of the i guess merger related or the notable items that you call out when do you think those completely go away or does some of that stick around as we think about just the overall expense on rate huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question ebrahim i think q4 should remain relatively elevated similar to the levels weve seen overall taking a step back overall our outlook for the mergerrelated costs that we guided back in december at the time of the announcement was million and we continue to expect it to be relatively near that level so i think that the timing of that weve seen in more than million at this point through this quarter and so well see a bit more come in q4 and then likely a last bit in q1 perhaps a tiny bit trailing into q2 and then by the end of q2 they essentially should be done ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just shifting to with the tcf integration sort of nearing an end steve strategically i mean youve been an acquisitive bank were hearing some concerns around just the regulatory stance around deal making getting tough just give us a sense of what your priorities are from a capital deployment is ma still a piece of the puzzle in terms of how you think about growing the bank stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well ebrahim weve done two larger bank combinations in years so i dont really think the characterization is apt but beyond that as weve said before our focus is on driving the core performance we think we have tremendous revenue upside here weve got greenfield opportunities for a number of businesses in denver and certainly the twin cities weve got a scale that weve never had in chicago frankly weve got density in michigan thats significant to us so were very focused on driving revenue and getting the benefits of that part of the combination equation weve done a few nonbank things in the past id say more likely over the next years possibly to do some of that but our focus our entire focus is on driving the core ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great thank you operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning can you remind us how much relative gearing you have to the short versus long end of the curve and how you think about performance in an environment where the short end rises perhaps a bit faster than the long end bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah first of all thanks for your question bill this is zach were most sensitive to the two to fouryear range within the yield curve to give you a sense and look i think were going to benefit here as rates move up irrespective of the steepening but certainly wed appreciate it if that two to fouryear range continue to move up huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 as it has been doing and its in our continued expectation and were positioning to benefit from that as i noted in some of my prepared remarks by driving incremental asset sensitivity and to give you a sense the average duration of our current downsize hedging portfolio is years versus the almost years for the duration of our payfixed swaps at a little benefit as rates start to rise so i think were positioned now in the quarter by more than a point of asset sensitivity as i noted and well look to be dynamic to improve that even as we go forward bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks zach thats super helpful and following up on that as you look ahead to higher short rates and better loan growth as utilization rates normalize how comfortable are you with the rate at which youve been reducing the amount of liquidity that you have parked at the fed and then as we look ahead over the next few quarters i guess should we expect you to continue to grow the securities portfolio from here just curious about the extent to which youd consider preserving liquidity through the rest of this year just based on the outlook zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a terrific question and its certainly something that we watch very very carefully i would say full stop we feel great about our liquidity levels and we think were managing exceptionally well but the cash the fed is a key area that we watch very very carefully and so were i would say i would characterize our approach as intentionally incremental watching the behaviors in our clients and deposit holding activities and seeking to kind of optimize incrementally periodbyperiod as more information comes out as weve guided for a couple of quarters now we expect it to add to the securities portfolio and i think last quarter we mentioned a number of billion we completed that during the third quarter well see where it goes from here if liquidity trends continue as we expect i also expect that we will add some additional securities in the fourth quarter were currently at about securities as a percentage of assets and wed be comfortable if that rose modestly over time here given the acceptable returns were seeing and the fact that its accretive to nim versus holding that cash but as you noted the priority is funding growth and so well as i said take a very much incremental approach watching both trends bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats super helpful thank you for taking my questions zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome thank you operator our next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right indiscernible thanks good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc in terms of the core nim i know there is a bit of confusion around why your guidance was or wasnt if we did our math right where i think your core nim just ex the paa is about which is a fair bit lower than that i think we were sort of shooting for can you just talk about i guess two things so one what drove sort of the weaker nim ex the paa but also how do you think about that core nim on a goforward basis thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure yeah thanks for the question ken so fully reported nim came in at and excluding paa as you noted it was so it was a few basis points lower than we expected my prior guidance had been just a few basis points lower than and it came in ultimately at so a bit lower than that the two biggest drivers of that were the things we just talked about in the last question actually interestingly elevated fed cash contributed several basis points additional drag in the quarter than we had previously expected and we did accelerate the purchase of our securities which also impacted the mix and drove yields lower generally spreads were sort of spot on our expectation ph overall at the core low level look i think what i would tell you is going forward im expecting stable from these levels it will be a function of what happens with the elevated liquidity and fed cash and the rate environment but generally stable from these levels is a fair assumption and our key focus at this point is trying to drive net interest income dollars at million of net interest income excluding paa excluding ppp given the sequential loan growth that were projecting given that rate stability my expectation is were going to grow those dollars into q4 and grow them throughout ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay perfect and then just in terms of the branch closures that you talked about in first quarter thats all wrapped up into your expense guidance i just want to make sure that were not we shouldnt take the expense guidance plus anything else because thats just part of the outlook correct zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre spot on ken so as steve noted in his prepared remarks we continue to optimize the network dynamically manage expenses and ensure that we can invest to capture those really powerful revenue synergies and overall the guidance we gave on expenses is net of all those things and ultimately what this is all driving toward is achieving our moderate term financial targets that we talked about over time the return on capital the revenue growth accelerating positive operating leverage to drive to that in the second half of ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hi steven good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to follow up on scotts initial question on loan growth and your response you guys sound pretty bullish on low momentum right steve you talked about how much of the commercial pipeline is up zach you talked about how momentum is building why are you not looking for stronger loan growth here in the fourth quarter stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steven great question this is steve this is a funny quarter because of the holidays interrupting so well have very good asset finance origination but weve had a substantial effort around the conversion weve had ambassadors out in our different business lines for a couple of weeks we pulled in at sort of peak production moments a lot of the talent the focus on making sure we got a great conversion and we think we did so its harder to do new business between the thanksgiving and year end if its not already in the pipeline so were talking about another three three and a half four weeks max for the pipeline now the pipelines are up as we indicated theyre up yearoveryear theyre up quarteroverquarter sequentially so thats contributing to the bullishness but its an odd quarter to be driving were very optimistic about how this will translate then for full year as we go forward we have some great capabilities that have come to us with tcf and weve already put in place much of the management and a number of the rms and other revenue producers that we were looking to do in the twin cities in denver and increasingly in chicago so the pieces are coming together very nicely and ahead of schedule and thats also contributing to the optimism steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and steve for my followup we all know huntington scores really well from a client satisfaction view did the branch consolidations have a notable negative impact on satisfaction levels and how long do you think itll take to move tcf below peer client satisfaction up to huntingtons level thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc just the sheer amount of activity has required substantial efforts and resources during the course of the year so we would expect to see a very modest decline in customer set and frankly we could be flat but we wouldnt expect to see an increase with respect to the tcf the new branches from tcf and our colleagues who are new from tcf they are embracing fair play and the product set what we saw during the conversion was just outstanding efforts with our customers and so were very encouraged it will take maybe a couple of quarters but huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 it wont take a couple of years in order to get that customer service level at an equivalency in those newer branches were very very pleased we got a great group of colleagues who have joined us from tcf steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc absolutely operator thank you our next question comes from john pancari with evercore please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi i know youve given your expectations here youve indicated your expectation for continued positive operating leverage how do you think about that for maybe if you can help us with the magnitude i know youre not specifically guiding on the top line or expense growth expectation but maybe if you can help us with the magnitude of positive operating leverage on a core basis that you think is reasonable for next year thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah john thanks for the question and youre done with your question and i will have to repeat to that im not going to give you specifics guidance but i will try to characterize to answer your question i think next years financials are going to be challenging to look at from a yearoveryear growth perspective and to some degree to calculate that metric just given the continued two quarters of growover impact of adding the tcf business but we do expect fullyear positive operating leverage in total and the big thing that were very focused on is driving to the point where the momentum coming into the second half of the year and its certainly exiting the year is on the levels that weve targeted for those moderate term targets and so at that point as we sort of get into a clean yearoveryear growth period to be able to see it better huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 and look i think well be dynamic as we always have been to ensure that we can modulate the expenses given where revenue is trending well continue to invest and might ph potentially well see solid positive operating leverage but not going to characterize the level specifically at this point john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thats helpful and then i guess sort of a related question is on the mediumterm efficiency goal of currently on an adjusted basis youre and curious on how youre thinking about that glide path down to the what type of timing do you think is reasonable updated based upon updated trends in the business whether youre seeing when do you think you can hit the thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah ph were going to drive towards that i would note that the efficiency ratio was sort of an outcome frankly and the most important metrics are revenue growth return on capital and positive operating numbers that were driving too but the efficiency is a key metric and so we are watching it carefully my expectation at this point is sort of during the second half of the year we will see those emerge were still doing some of the budgeting to modulate the precision with respect to quarters but certainly i think by the second half of the year and the exit run rate of q4 is my expectation john pancari q analyst evercore isi second half of zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc correct correct i said i misspoke indiscernible john pancari q analyst evercore isi no no no i just want to clarify okay all right thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning terry huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi tcf had about a 2plus billion inventory finance portfolio im curious where is that portfolio today and then the auto dealer floor plan balances at huntington kind of precovid versus today what im getting at is whats the upside to the balance sheet when inventories in both of those portfolios hypothetically normalize zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think as weve talked about a bit over time interestingly each of the three major kind of line businesses that weve got auto inventory and general middle market each of them represented roughly billion opportunities when those utilization rates return to normalized precovid levels so thats sort of give you an order of magnitude the trends were seeing at this point in auto were down a couple more percentage points to be precise between the end of q2 and the end of q3 to at this point im seeing relative stability in the auto floor plan business to some degree some of the chip issues and other supply chain issues produce some incremental pressure were also getting some defined and known new commitments and some term debt into those businesses such that my expectation is relatively flat in that space and interestingly inventory finance has similar opportunities where were creating some very known planned uses of those lines so expect stability perhaps even a modest uptick actually into q4 that the general middle market should continue to be flat here for the time being however im going to indiscernible answer your question but i was holding back a second i would just highlight that its our planning expectation at this point that the totality of these lines is going to be relatively flat throughout the course of there could well be an opportunity against that but at this point for planning purposes were trying to zero that out but we still expect pretty good loan growth and i think thats really just sort of pointing back to the robust new production activity that were seeing so this could be ultimately the tailwind we do expect over time indiscernible be and the headwind nature has largely moderated at this point we expect it generally flat terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and then as a followup the million of service charges on the tcf part were the fee adjustments made right after the conversion i remember there was some revisions that ph were going to made that would result in lower fees and im just looking at that run rate and asking if thats sustainable going forward zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question and upon conversion that we completed over the columbus day weekend all the tcf customers are now on to the huntington products the platform and all of our fair play product dynamics and so we will expect to see a modestly lower trajectory for that line into q4 overall over the longer term we feel great about the conversion to the fair play business as weve talked about a lot and this is a play we have run many times and were very confident in the returns that are generated typically the dynamic is sort of a higher degree of fee income reduction in the early periods offset over time by incremental deepening and incremental acquisition in the market from those products generally about an 18month payback and so thats sort of the dynamic were huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 expecting to see a bit lower into q4 and then clawing back and paying back over that kind of roughly year period terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thank you zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just back on the loan growth topic you highlighted the latestage middle market up and then just curious what you think is behind that and how much things have changed over the last couple of quarters and then steve or rich do you have any feedback on the supply chains loosening up from your borrowers stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc jon ill start this this is steve rich or zach may choose to add but the supply chain issues continue to be a challenge youre seeing some oems ship and deliver without ships even some of the autos are doing that but weve got auto dealers with no new inventory on the lot is shocking to illustrate the challenges here and as i think you saw with the ford gm earnings announcements expectations that its going to go deep into next year before it gets normalized so thats why zachs earlier comment is were not counting on utilization normalization and inventory finance or auto to be a tailwind next year if it happens thats great now we do see supply chain issues getting resolved or getting to a resolution over time and i would expect that to continue again through next year maybe even a little bit beyond depending on the industry but theres a lot of activity in the footprint about tooling and additional manufacturing capabilities in with adjacency in north america including in the footprint states that we are in so we like how this steps up over time in terms of additional opportunity for us and we are bullish but we clearly had both the supply chain and the labor issue in virtually every business thats out there today richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 thank you steve its rich maybe just to piggyback on that i think as it relates to middle market low demand were seeing in a couple of places i think steve mentioned increased capex given the labor issues i think there is a bigger push to automate production to garner that productivity that will offset some of the labor issues the other thing that were seeing is just a heightened level of ma i think as were coming out of kind of the covid fog here with respect to ebitda levels and things there is just a greater sense of certainty around cash flows and i think buyers are aggressively looking to expand if they can and sellers i think some of them have just got a little tired kind of going through a covid environment and when their cash flows are picking back up to a position where maybe they want to sell and so we are seeing increased ma in the middle market space as well stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc there is also jon a dynamic in the twin cities and denver tcf did not have their market banking there were a series of things they just didnt do so these are greenfield every customer is net new and that the teams are in place as earlier mentioned and i will be building them out further but weve got the core in place were seeing success and thats translating into additional crosssell revenue as well and thats contributing to this optimism jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah im guessing sba fall in that as well is that fair stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yes it does really jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then can you just touch on your repurchase appetite from here zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill take that one jon i think look were being pretty dynamic on it we had a very intentional plan thats going into the third quarter as we noted in the july call to accelerate in front load and we felt great about the million i think were going to likely continue to be somewhat front loaded with the balance of that here in q4 and as we go into q1 but still working through it and i think looking to be dynamic as we do that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thanks good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company zach i was just wondering in the third quarter did you have some gross savings in there or and can you tell us what they were i know youre only kind of telling us that were going to decline from here but just wondering what you might have already captured zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i would say that they were quite modest in the third quarter i think if you think about the cost savings they came largely from ultimately branch rationalization employee level of reductions technology synergies supporting the tcf business essentially onto the huntington tech stack and thats sort of a long tail of other savings including a number of vendor and sourcing related opportunities that come with sort of increased scale and for the most part most of those really were beginning to be executed on during the third quarter with sort of effect more into the fourth and as you go into the first quarter the decisions around them and the planning and actions necessary to achieve them have essentially all been completed and now were in the execution mode of just realizing them so not much i guess is the longwinded answer in the third quarter more substantively in the fourth quarter which is partially why were talking about sort of a larger step down in the fourth quarter than weve done before and then if we go into the first quarter sort of yet again a similar level of step down is my current expectation then a bit of a more of an indiscernible function as you get into q3 and q4 but still stepping down ken usdin q analyst jefferies company and a followup on that do you have any change to your view of the original ph in total that you expect i know youre telling us maybe we see a little bit more of a pull forward from a timing perspective but what about the absolute amount zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no i mean the absolute amount is solid at that level and i mean were kind of within rounding errors higher than that so nothing overly substantive that i would call out i point you to the ph is thats the number were looking to achieve and weve got ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay and last cleanup one just ppp in the deck you showed that youre million of the fees left how do you expect the nii related to ppp to traject from here fourth quarter and beyond on the ph million something zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 its kind of like a halflife function i would tell you over the next three quarters were expecting roughly of the adv to reduce into the fourth quarter and then roughly of that reducing into the first and then yet again into the second these are planning assumptions im giving we should note that its pretty dynamic and the sba to their credit has been accelerating forgiveness quite substantively recently and so these numbers move around but from a planning perspective thats essentially the kind of outlook function that weve got ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it thank you zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator our next question comes from david long with raymond james please proceed david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc just i wanted to drill down on the service charge on deposits here and a good quarter from i think expectations and steve when you look at the press the headlines that it gets talked about a lot that there is going to be some restrictions on overdraft and just curious how you are thinking about that and how that may impact your fees going forward and then secondly when i think of the overdraft side of things fair play banking something that you guys have i think your overdraft fees would be a smaller portion of revenue to peers but get your screen a little bit higher there just curious as to why you think that may be the case as well thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc david great questions we put hour grace in more than a decade ago and that continues to this day we opened it up last year for small business and were continuing to do certain things to help our customers standby cash is a classic example of that there is no limit to the use of those funds with our customers we put up a minimum of in last year for an overdraft and call that safety zone so we have been continuously over time working to benefit our customers as part of this fair play banking philosophy we tend to be very strong on a relative basis in terms of customer acquisition as a consequence of the different features and functions on our checking products and thats ameliorated the revenue give up over the last decade or so very very substantially as zach pointed out there will be a bit of a step down in the fourth quarter for a couple of quarters thereafter with the tcf customers but theyre going to get the same advantage of products and services that all of our previously existing customers have as well huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 and it will accompany our expectation around both customer retention and customer acquisition its hard to i cant speculate on what regulators may do but again weve been trying to do things to help consumers and businesses for quite some time not just with overdraft fees but other types of fee eliminations reductions notice requirements we put a new alert system in in that regard years ago so theres a lot of tools available to help customers manage their money budgets et cetera and avoid overdraft fees david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you steve i appreciate that color
