president mt bank corp thanks don and good morning everyone as noted in this mornings press release we were pleased with the improving level of economic activity our markets experienced in the third quarter particularly in terms of consumer and business spending specifically we saw strong debit and credit card usage both by consumers and business which also manifested in an increase in merchant volumes the mortgage market was robust in the third quarter where we witnessed an uptick in both residential origination volumes and margins our trust business experienced the increase in money fund fee waivers we had been anticipating but those were offset by strong equity and debt markets during the quarter expense trends were in line with our expectations as we continue to exercise diligence in a particularly difficult revenue environment also encouraging are the trends for commercial customers granted some form of covid19 forbearance and for which have reached its endpoint approximately have asked for additional relief the common equity tier1 ratio improved by basis points to at the same time the allowance for loan losses grew to of loans positioning mt to meet the needs of our customers and communities now lets review our results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the third quarter of compared with in the second quarter of and in the third quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the yearago quarter on a gaap basis mts third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur mts net operating income for the third quarter which excludes intangible amortization was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in last years third quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in second quarter and in the third quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the second quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity turning to the balance sheet and income statement taxable equivalent net interest income was million in the third quarter of marking a decline of million or from the linked quarter that decrease primarily mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 reflects the impact on loan yields from the basis point decline in average onemonth libor compared to the second quarter higher premium amortization on residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities was also a factor the net interest margin declined by basis points to compared with in the linked quarter average interestearning assets increased by billion to billion for the third quarter primarily reflecting a billion increase in funds invested with either the federal reserve bank of new york or into resale agreements those investments were funded by a similar increase in deposits approximately evenly divided between interest and noninterestbearing dda the increase in cash equivalent investments caused an estimated basis points of pressure on the net interest margin while having little effect on net interest income the lower interest rate environment primarily the lower average rate on onemonth libor that i mentioned previously contributed to approximately basis points of the margin decline the net impact of lower loan yields was somewhat mitigated by a basis point decrease in the cost of interestbearing deposits the accelerated premium amortization on both residential mortgage loans and on mortgagebacked securities contributed some basis points of margin pressure all other factors contributed to an additional basis point of the decline for context since the fourth quarter of the combination of shortterm liquidity investments primarily placed at the fed and investment securities has increased by billion reducing the net interest margin by approximately basis points while incrementally benefiting net interest income average total loans increased by million or a little less than compared with the previous quarter looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans declined by billion or primarily the results of a billion decline in vehicle dealer floor plan loans that reflects the usual seasonal softness as well as the delays some dealers are having in replacing inventory being sold ppp loans were effectively unchanged from the end of the second quarter at billion commercial real estate loans grew by less than compared with the second quarter residential real estate loans increased by just under billion or reflecting loans purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools pending resolution partially offset by repayments consumer loans were up by reflecting higher indirect recreation finance loans partially offset by lower auto loans and home equity lines of credit average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at mts cayman islands office and cds over grew by billion primarily in interest and noninterest checking or about compared with the second quarter turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the recent quarter included million of valuation gains on equity securities largely on our remaining holdings of gse preferred stock while the second quarter included million of such gains mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter improving from million in the linked quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were billion in the quarter up from billion in the second quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were million in the third quarter improved from million in the prior quarter the increase reflects the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 higher volume of loans originated for sale combined with stronger gain on sale margins residential servicing revenues declined very slightly commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled million encompassing both originations and servicing and which was little changed from the second quarter trust income was million in the recent quarter down slightly from million in the previous quarter recall that second quarter figures included million of seasonal tax preparation fees aside from that business remained solid with slightly higher money market fund fee waivers offset by continued strong debt capital markets activity service charges on deposit accounts were million improved sharply from million in the second quarter the improvement comes primarily from some of the covid19impacted categories on the consumer side the result of higher levels of spending compared with the prior quarter similarly the million improvement in other revenues from operations compared with the linked quarter reflects a rebound in covid19impacted payments revenues that are not included in service charges such as credit card interchange and merchant discount with a slight improvement in loanrelated fees including syndications turning to expenses operating expenses for the third quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were million compared with million in the second quarter the million linked quarter increase in salaries and benefits reflect the impact of one additional workday during the quarter and higher compensation tied to the uptick in both mortgage banking and trustrelated activity compared with the prior quarter recall that other cost of operations for each of the first and second quarters included a million addition to the valuation allowance on our capitalized mortgage servicing rights there was neither an addition nor release from the valuation allowance during the third quarter the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in the second quarter and in the third quarter of next lets turn to credit net chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net charge offs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the third quarter compared to basis points in the second quarter the provision for loan losses in the third quarter amounted to million exceeding net charge offs by million and increasing the allowance for credit losses to billion or of loans the allowance at the end of the third quarter reflects an updated macroeconomic scenario that is different and modestly less severe than those used at the end of the first and second quarters which modeled the uncertainty of the covid19driven damage to the economy the allowance and the related provision in the recent quarter reflect ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors the uncertainty over additional economic stimulus and the ultimate collectibility of commercial real estate loans where borrowers are requesting repayment forbearance our current macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and gdp our forecast assumes the quarterly unemployment rate increases to in the fourth quarter of this year followed by a sustained highsingledigit unemployment rate through the forecast mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 assumes gdp contracts during and recovers to prerecession peak levels by the third quarter of our forecast assumes no additional government stimulus nonaccrual loans as of september amounted to billion an increase of million from the end of june at the end of the quarter nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans was it is important to keep in mind that some of the usual credit metrics have been affected by the ppp loans on the balance sheet which are zero riskweighted and carry little or no credit risk excluding the impact of ppp loans the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans would be similarly the ratio of nonaccrual to total loans would be and annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans would be basis points loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter of these loans million or were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities government guaranteed loan under covid forbearance and which we have purchased from servicing pools are generally not reflected in these figures consistent with regulatory and cares act provisions loans that have received some sort of forbearance whether payment deferrals covenant modifications or other form of relief as a result of covid19related stress for the most part are not yet reflected in our nonaccrual or delinquency numbers a significant majority of commercial loans that were granted covid19 payment relief were for days with the ability for clients to request second days for example substantially all of the billion of forbearance as of june given to vehicle dealers was for days and less than million are under some form of forbearance relief at the end of the third quarter for the total commercial and industrial portfolio including the aforementioned dealer portfolio loans under covid19 forbearance have declined by to slightly higher than million or about as of september customers in the commercial real estate portfolio generally received 180day covid19 deferrals in total deferrals in the cre portfolio have declined by to billion over twothirds of the loans on active forbearance as of september that have not reached their endpoint relate to the cre portfolio segments most impacted by covid19 notably hotels and retail cre well know more over the next days or so as the day deferrals reach their end of term for the consumer portfolios deferrals declined from just under million at june to under million or less than at the end of september for residential mortgage loans we own nongovernmentguaranteed loans under deferral amount to billion down about from the second quarter total deferrals have increased to billion from billion days ago all of that increase reflects governmentguaranteed loans purchased from servicing pools that represent no credit risk to mt all of these figures do not include approximately billion of forbearance on residential mortgage loans we service for others turning to capital mts common equity tier1 capital ratio was an estimated as of september compared to at the end of the second quarter this reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividends mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 paid and slightly lower riskweighted assets mt did not repurchase shares during the third quarter and will not be doing so in the fourth quarter mts net income comfortably exceeded its common stock dividend both for the quarter and under the trailing fourquarter calculations outlined by the federal reserve now turning to the outlook our usual practice is to offer thoughts on the coming year in the january earnings calls after weve completed our planning process so my remarks today will be somewhat brief were all pleased to see that the economy has improved while recognizing that were still a long way from conditions we saw in january and february core commercial loan growth excluding ppp loans has slowed and we expect those balances to remain flat to slightly down over the remainder of compared to where we ended the quarter given that the auto manufacturers or still not running at normal levels we dont expect the normal seasonal rebound in dealer floor plan loans during the fourth quarter our portal for receiving forgiveness requests of ppp loans is open and applications are being processed and sent on to the sba most of the activity so far is on the smaller loans on which the sba is expediting relief the residential mortgage loans we purchased from servicing pools arent fully reflected in the third quarter average combined with the potential for further buyouts we should see modest growth in average residential mortgage loans for the current quarter allin we expect modest linkedquarter growth in total loans more difficult to forecast has been our liquidity assets or shortterm investments and the deposits with the fed which continued to rise over the past quarter although at a much slower pace as i noted earlier this was primarily the result of further deposit inflows although uncertain at present we may be approaching the peak and may see declines in the current quarter as both deposits and associated shortterm investments decline wed expect that the net interest margin would benefit by about to basis points per billion decline with limited impact on net interest income with libor having reached a steady state and our expectation for additional modest downward trends in deposit costs we expect net interest income to be slightly higher in the final quarter of if a significant balance of ppp loans are forgiven the accelerated recognition of the ppp loan fees would be a further benefit weve previously mentioned that the size of the active cash flow hedge position on our floatingrate loan portfolio will step up during this quarter to be more specific the billion notional amount of active cash flow hedges will step up to billion this quarter and then remain at those levels for about one year the benefit to net interest income is less substantive as the older swaps with higher fixed receive rates mature and forward starting swaps with lower receive rates become active turning to fees residential mortgage applications continue to be strong with rates as low as they are we expect continued solid origination volumes this quarter but likely with some pressure on margin for trust income we have seen the increase in waivers of money market mutual fund management be somewhat offset by strong debt capital markets activity we expect those waivers will reach a steady state shortly and will persist while the zero rate environment endures mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 service charge income was boosted by higher levels of customer activity notably in payments with some volumes at or even better than precovid levels further upside from the current levels appears likely sorry unlikely we have no change to our expense guidance for the remainder of we continue to expect expenses for the second quarter or second half of the year to be in line with the first half excluding the seasonal factors in this years first quarter any additional loan loss provisioning will be determined by changes to the macroeconomic variables that we see at the end of the year and by the portfolio composition lastly turning to capital we are continuing to build capital levels as limited loan growth and profits in excess of the dividend bolster our capital ratios consistent with the guidance from our regulators we wont repurchase stock or recommend that the board consider a change to the dividend during the fourth quarter of course as youre aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now lets open the call up to questions before which maria will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the credit side wondering if you could give us a little bit more color behind the rationale for the reserve build in the quarter i know you mentioned some of the ongoing uncertainty and the backdrop around stimulus so just curious was there an overlay that you applied or are you seeing something specific there to justify the addition darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure john i guess if you break down some of the components the big driver obviously is the macroeconomic variables that you run through the model and while they were modestly better the out quarters really havent changed much from what we were looking at in the third quarter so those really drive the magnitude of the allowance at its core and so there is really no change there and then when you look underneath you see some growth in certain segments of the portfolio so growth in the consumer book and some mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 growth in cre much of the addition was for that and then the other just reflects the uncertainty i guess is the way to put it or some conservatism in the forbearance portfolio and what that ultimately might look like john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thats helpful thanks and then separately on the credit front can you give us an update on the performance trends that youre seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio from a credit perspective how are you seeing your borrowers impacted amid the backdrop and are you seeing some stress there in terms of credit performance thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so i guess looking at the commercial real estate portfolio the ones that we are most focused on right now the segments were most focused on are the hotel segment and the retail segment and those are ones where there has been significant amount of forbearance in those portfolios and for the most part those portfolios received 180day forbearance and so they will start to show themselves over the next days and the hotel business continues to be challenged particularly in some of the larger cities where you have a hotel that maybe relies on conferences or food and beverage as part of their business those ones are probably the most challenged when you get into other segments of the hotel portfolio where youre able to get there by car and able to drive up weve seen some return of revenue not all the way back obviously to where things were but able to cash flow and so were watching those portfolios as we go through this quarter but were pleased by the reaction weve seen from the customers so far and their ability to manage their expenses down to try and keep their cash flow at least as close to breakeven as possible we continue to feel very positive about the loantovalues in the portfolio and that in particular in new york city which i know gets a lot of attention i think the average loantovalue is less than and when i look at in new york city we have about million of loans outstanding which are two loans that are between and ltv and five loans in million between and and then the vast majority is less than ltv and so when you look at those properties and the values theres a lot invested by the clients already in those properties and they have a real strong incentive to figure out how to maintain it on the retail side its a similar space i think retail has been a bit of a challenged industry much before covid hit in that watching things going on line we were seeing challenges on pricing and rents and covid just accelerated that but again when we look at our portfolio and the distribution of the ltvs again skews very low and in particular in new york city skews also below and when we look at some of our larger relationships they have some ltvs where theyre multigenerational ownership of properties and their cost basis in some cases is down in the of current values and the tax basis that they have is very low so they also have a very vested interest in protecting those properties and so its longwinded way of saying theres certainly stress out there but the clients have been active in adjusting their operations to the environment and then many of them have outside resources and liquidity to help carry the properties while things try and come back to normal so well know a little bit more in days but were very pleased by the actions that our clients have taken so far to protect their investments operator our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so the loans that you purchased out of the ginnie mae pools whats the yield on those and are you likely to purchase again at a similar level in darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so in round numbers the yield on those ginnies is about each one will be slightly different but its right around there plus or minus basis points and its something that we will continue to do just because it makes economic sense to take some of these loans that are being serviced and buy them out so that we only have the carry cost and we dont have to advance the principal and interest to the investors but i think what you saw in this quarter was a larger than what will be normal uptick in those balances because there was some residual hangover from the second quarter where there hadnt been active buyouts happening and so the run rate is probably more in like the million to million a month range give or take and it was just a larger uptick this quarter because that hadnt happened very much in the second quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and i think you also said the purchase were late in the quarter so well see the benefit flow through into from this quarter darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah it continues through the quarter there will be a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter but not as big as what we saw this quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thanks for taking my questions darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of americamerrill lynch hi good morning darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of americamerrill lynch my one question is on the contribution from the swap portfolio heard you loud and clear in terms of the notional stepping up to billion and im wondering if you could give us a sense on what the contribution was to net interest income from your derivative book in the fourth sorry in the third quarter and how that progressed either on an annual or quarterly basis however you want to give it in darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so i think we talked last quarter about the hedging adding about basis points to the net interest margin for the quarter was up slightly in the third quarter to about basis points and what youll see going forward is as we mentioned earlier as the notional goes up but the coupon the received fixed comes down the impacts about the same we think in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year and then over time as the start of the swaps that become active have a lower coupon the benefit will start to trickle down as we go through and probably a good assumption would be like after you get through the second quarter basis points a quarter decrease in the benefit of the hedge based on our forecast of what the balance sheet looks like erika najarian q analyst bank of americamerrill lynch got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor of deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i want to followup on expenses the cost control has been very good this year and the guidance for is in line with what you said three months ago but how sustainable is the expense management is it kind of just a onetime sort of pulling in on something is that is all that sustainable is that kind of some structural changes or a combination of two of them darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah matt its a good question i guess some of the things that i think are sustainable that you really see illuminated in the third quarter results is if you look at the salaries and benefits and you compare them to where they were in the third quarter of last year you can see theyre basically flat theyre up i think about million but if you look at the other cost of operations which is where the professional services shows up you can see the drop there now some of the drop obviously is because there was impairment that we took in the third quarter of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 last year that didnt repeat itself this year but outside of that you seen weve seen a decrease in the professional services line and weve been talking for a number of quarters about the path weve been on to build technology skills and insource those which would impact the salary benefit line and it took a while for the professional services to come out and so youve seen that remixing weve got a little bit more to do and so i think there is some evidence that that is working and we can continue to do that which i would say is more structural a couple of the other big items obviously are travel and entertainment and advertising and promotion i think look were seeing in the advertising and promotion line item is that obviously you need to be competitive in the markets that youre advertising in but also were learning that there is different ways that you can reach customers and prospects that might be more costeffective than traditional means and so well be continuing to look at that as we go forward and being smarter about that and also thinking a lot harder about how much travel we need both internally for sure and then oftentimes with clients i dont think you can get away from facetoface interactions in banking but maybe we dont need quite as much as weve had in the past so were looking at how were doing our business and i think the last thing you see is through the ppp process were able to handle such a massive amount of loan volumes in a short period of time i mean we literally did about three years worth of sba loans in a week and we did that through changing the process and using more digitization and so we think that there is opportunity to take that thought process beyond just business loans into other lending and deposit opening and other operations to drive expenses down and so i guess long story short i think theres been some things that were gifts so to speak from the pandemic but its also really got us to rethinking and continue on the path of rethinking how we do the work and that offers continuous improvement i dont know that there is a step change down but we continue to chisel away and i think that that would allows us to slow expense growth and to get close to positive operating leverage i mean to me to be in this environment where weve had challenges in revenue and the efficiency ratio this quarter was the same as last year i think just speaks to the ability of the team to be disciplined on expenses which is kind of classic mt matthew q oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful im going to guess you dont want to give explicit guidance on cost but you just said no step down but also kind of described an implication that it wouldnt be a step up as well so if i had to guess i would think seems like youre trying to keep costs relatively flat by parsing some of your comments together there darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i think thats a safe assumption well like i said well be back with more detail in january but thats certainly a safe assumption matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey darren can i ask how are you can i ask you further on the trust income you said that the fee waivers would be run rated i think going forward can you just help us understand what was in the third and what the step up if any is going to be into the fourth darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so i think we talked before about maybe million a quarter impact from those fee waivers and i think this quarter we saw about million and it was offset by an uptick in some of the loan agency fees that we get because youve been watching the debt markets i think they hit a record for issuance at the end of september and they still have three months to go and so that activity our participation in that market you saw reflected in some of the agency fees that show up in that trust income line and so it massed the impact of those fee waivers on the money fund accounts also we had and continue to have strong equity markets and thats impacting aum positively maybe a little better than we might have thought going into the quarter and so that also was a positive that was an offset and so the money fund waivers that we had talked about are basically in there there might be a little bit more to go and then the question will be what happens with some of those other parts of the trust business and how robust those markets are as we go through the fourth quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you and then just a followup on mortgage can you give a little bit more discussion of just the differences between resi and commercial origination activity and then also are you still seeing opportunities to buy additional servicing assets as you guys have been pretty frequent opportunistic buyers there thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so i guess most of the action for the last couple of quarters has really been in the consumer space and its just with rates where they are theres a lot of refi activity going on and so thats really whats been driving the volume there what i think has been seen for the last two quarters both for us and for the industry is that there was so much volume it overwhelmed peoples capacity to handle it and so one of the ways the industry manages capacity is through pricing and so thats why the margins were so strong this quarter and last and so look what do we expect to see in the fourth quarter is we expect to see similar levels of volume maybe seasonally slower just because of the fourth quarter but well start to see the margins come down we started to see that at the end of the last quarter that the gainonsale margin in september was down from what it was in mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 july and august and so we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter and thats why we think well see a drop in the mortgage fee line item in commercial things have been slow really since covid hit theres just not a lot of activity in the commercial real estate space third quarter i think for the last couple of years has been a blowout quarter for us in the commercial real estate sector this year was the notable exception and we dont see that changing into the fourth quarter its just a slowdown in activity there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks a lot darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure thing operator our next question comes from the line of saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys i wanted to parse through some of the moving parts on net interest income so i think in the response to erikas question you mentioned darren that the protection from the hedges gate were about bps which by my calculations amount to roughly million just to clarify then your guidance for nii in the fourth quarter that assumes that that level of protection more or less stays flat ie theres no incremental benefit and youre also assuming no ppp forgiveness in that outlook is that correct darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thats right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then just following up there you kind of painted a picture on the outlook into for the benefit sort of trickling down gradually especially in the latter part of the year but your disclosure show that your i think the average weighted average maturity is about years on the swap of where it was at in the second quarter which would seem to imply that there would be some more material step down in protection at some point between now and say yearend i mean i guess how should we read that and think about that is there going to be more of a cliff effect on the hedge protection that you get late next year into just maybe a little bit more color in terms of how that evolved not just during the course of but looking out over the life of those hedges darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess so when you think about the hedging that we did and the way we constructed the portfolio we were always adding a consistent level with the exception obviously of this next months of forward starting mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 swaps and so the idea was to keep the outstanding notional amount fairly consistent through time and really what starts to happen is each month one swap falls off and a new one starts and it would be reflective of the rate environment at the time at which we entered into that agreement and so were in the spot now where were entering these agreements and the curve was positively sloping and rates were higher and over time you saw those received fixed coupons come down and so theres not really a cliff per se but more a continual gradual decline as each month some swaps go inactive and forward starting ones become active and that brings the average received fixed coupon thats in place in any month declining through and into and then as the duration of the swap portfolio will shorten because the rates really fell down at the end of and then at the start of there wasnt a benefit that we saw in continuing to add forward starting swaps to lock in rates at or basis points now that we continue to believe that zero is for all intents and purposes the practical floor right now and that negative rates are not a huge consideration of the fed and so weve slowed down in the hedging and that youll see that it gradually goes away through the next months donald j macleod a administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp just a point of clarification the weighted average maturity is not from the reporting date but from the start date of the forward starting swap to the end of the forward starting swap saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay so its not years necessarily donald j macleod a administrative vice president assistant secretary directorinvestor relations mt bank corp from now yeah saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah from now okay its from when they all the forward starting swaps come on board okay i guess the second let me just pivot quickly to second question the cre book days forbearance i think you mentioned billion and twothirds of that i guess exiting the initial deferral period so a couple of questions there do you have any expectations as to what percentage of that will ask for second modification and how do you expect to account for additional modification do you anticipate taking advantage of the cares act the to not classify it as a tdr or will you say these loans have been in modification for an extended period and hence we think they should be treated as tdr even with some of the i guess the negative implications for risk weighted assets and other things im just curious what youre expecting there and how you plan to account for it darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so i guess a couple of things obviously its hard to predict exactly what will happen with each of these portfolios as we go but i look at what weve seen so far and so i mentioned that the ci portfolio was going to be down to about million of loans still in forbearance the bulk of that is really folks who havent reached the end of their current term mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 when i look at the dealers and the floor plan dealers that were in forbearance i mean basically of them have gone back to paying when i look at the rest of the ci portfolio its about have gone back to paying and there has been some decrease in the commercial real estate portfolio levels of forbearance and when i look at folks who have come up for or to the end of their time period so far about of them have gone back on to their normal payment schedule and so from what weve seen so far about have gone back or have asked for some extension of their forbearance when we get into the next group that will come up i think its a tougher segment and so im not sure im bold enough to say it will be but the trends that weve seen are positive and we know that there are a number of clients that weve talked to that do actually plan to resume payments because they have outside liquidity and the wherewithal to go back and maintaining their loans as it relates to how theyll be handled i mean each loan and each client will be treated individually and considered individually and well look at first of all are they looking for some kind of change to their terms and if they are are we getting anything back we might be able to get an interest reserve we might be able to get a little bit of equity we might get a different rate and so the combination of those things will help us go through our determination of whether we think it qualifies as a tdr or needs to go on nonaccrual but i think its safe to say that there will be an uptick in those categories as we go into the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay so it will be treated on an individual basis then okay thats helpful darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah itll go through our normal portfolio assessment and grading process saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and presumably youve reserved for it already under cecl so darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp weve set aside some for that yeah saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay great thanks so much darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp no problem operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc while weve seen some improvement in metrics like unemployment and gdp and your outlook there is helpful but some of the cre metrics have been going the other way can you give us a little bit more color on what your outlook is contemplating for some of those key drivers for cre metric performance some of the industry forecasts have metrics like vacancy rates continuing to rise and commercial real estate prices continuing to decline as we look out to i understand that shouldnt have an impact on your cecl allowance as long as it contemplates that degradation but it would be helpful to understand a bit better what your expectations are if possible darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess one of the most important parts of this is understanding not just whats going on but how the loan was underwritten to start and so when you look at a lot of our real estate portfolio and ill speak to multifamily we take into account the current rents and we dont assume the rent increases when we underwrite we take into account the current vacancy but we underwrite to a higher level of vacancies than what exists and another really important element is just the interest rates and that as the interest rates drop that creates a lot of capacity to support these properties and so a lot of those factors will also help maintain collateral values and so weve seen vacancy pick up one of the places obviously we watch a lot is in new york city and weve seen rent collections in the to range so we feel pretty good about that there hasnt really been much to straight it in terms of values to think about commercial real estate price index which the crepi would be an important element in the cecl modeling so we havent seen much there so those factors rent changes we would look at and look at the vacancy rate and the realizable rent as we forecast cash flows for each of these individual borrowers and think through whether or not theyre running at a deficit or not are they able to adjust their expense base and then what outside resources they have to maybe come in and maintain the properties and thered be a similar viewpoint on the hotel portfolio obviously slightly different where youre looking at revpar and youre looking at occupancy rates and again weve seen and it depends on the geography some uptick new york has been a little bit more of a challenge but we see that in office also so far rent collections are holding up and strong and people are going back into the city at least youre hearing announcements particularly from the tech sector of space being under contract and so i guess little bit of a longwinded answer to say that when we look at the trends in these portfolios were not seeing a severe degradation its gradual and what weve watched so far weve seen the clients doing very good job of adjusting their business to be able to manage their cash flow and where they dont do that they often mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 have the outside liquidity to be able to maintain the property and i guess the question really is how much liquidity do they have and how long can they sustain it in this environment bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful thanks darren if i can squeeze in one last one darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc beyond the hedging benefits that youve discussed can you give a bit more color on the loan and securities portfolio paydowns on your back book perhaps by product if possible whats the yield differential between whats paying down and what youre deploying into today darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i guess when you look at the ill take the loan book separate from the securities book on the securities book we basically run it for not a lot of duration risk and certainly not a lot of credit risk and its we describe it as a barbell where there has been a significant amount invested in when your treasuries are less and then another significant amount in mortgagebacked securities and with the mortgagebacked securities as they pay down we havent been buying additional securities at this point just given where rates are and those dollars are basically going into cash and so thats part of the cash build interesting when you look at the loan portfolios what weve seen in the last days and probably started a little bit earlier is that the margins on new business have been increasing and so when we look at the returns that are being generated on new loans over the last days theyre higher than whats in the book and so between floors going into the loans where the floors are actually active the day the loan starts and some firming in the pricing were actually starting to see rollon margins higher than rolloff margins in the loan book and so when you get it will take a little while for that to start to shift the whole portfolio but as you get out into and beyond you start to see a greater proportion of that benefit in the loan yields and the loan margin and so its encouraging to see where things are heading at least based on the last days bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thanks again darren operator our next question comes from the line of brian klock of keefe bruyette woods brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning darren and don mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hey how are you doing brian brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc im good im good hey real quick on the fee income you talked about the deposits service charges snapping back nicely in the quarter when i look at the other revenues from operations i mean can you give us a little color on whats going on in there because it feels like the overall level is sort of back to precovid if you get rid of the bayview from the first quarter i dont know was there anything in there when you look at boli or the discount merchant discount any of the insurance revenues or is there anything in there that you can give us color to that is that million somewhat runratable into the fourth darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah sure brian by and large when you look through the components in that category we have seen a strong snapback in merchant discount and credit cards theyre pretty much back to precovid levels boli was pretty consistent as was some of the underwriting loan fees were up quarteroverquarter but not back to precovid level and obviously thats a function of whats going on with the activity in the market and then sometimes in that line item there is some lumpiness of things that happen and we were i guess on that line item close to where we average ive seen some quarters where its million higher than what we had before and last quarter was particularly low so it might be a little bit high from where we might run rate in the fourth quarter but theres still some spots where theres softness some softness in insurance and some softness still on some of the fees were not quite all the way back to precovid levels on loan fees and merchant card brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it got it and just quick follow up same question on the other side the other miscellaneous costs looks like they were down a little bit lower than the run rate over the last few quarters and usually the fourth quarter has like the professional services or the accountant accruals and stuff like that that might be in there so should we expect that one to be kind of back up to sort of average levels versus the million within the third quarter darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i think that the spot were at now is probably pretty reasonable for where we are in the fourth quarter and barring the only other thing that goes through there that creates some lumpiness is there has been litigation costs or msr impairment or when we took the write down on the asset manager that we sold that goes through that line item so kind of holding that stuff aside i think we are give or take a few million bucks in the right zone of where that will be for the fourth quarter brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it great thanks for the time appreciate it darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 sure brian operator ladies and gentleman we have time for one more question our final question will come from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning gerard how are you doing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you for taking the question to wrap up can you give us a comment on what youre thinking about for next year on capital action plans obviously the fed has suspended buybacks for all the banks like your size but what are you guys thinking should the gate get lifted and second if its not lifted until lets say the third or fourth quarter of next year and your capital really is starting to accumulate is a dutch auction tender offer a consideration to bring in to get all the stock at once darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so i guess the first part of ill leave the dutch auction thing for a second i havent really thought much about a dutch auction to be honest with you i appreciate it youve always got great questions on deployment of capital well obviously have to wait and see what comes from the fed through the resubmission process that were all going through right now and if the fed actually allows the scb framework to be effective but generally our thought process on capital deployment really isnt changing and that the first place we want to deploy capital is in the service of our customers and the communities that we do business in and weve got the liquidity as you can clearly see on the balance sheet and we keep generating the capital so that were in a position to be able to lend and support growth in the communities and so hopefully well see some of that and as i mentioned before i really like the returns that im seeing on some of the businesses right now after that well obviously hope that were maintaining our income and so we can maintain the dividend and then well look at what other alternatives we have to deploy the capital to me the most important thing is well try and return it if we got excess and were allowed to but really the key of how weve always run the bank is to make sure that we dont take the capital that we believe to be excess and consider it free if we sit on the capital its inefficient and wed certainly rather not do that but investing it in low return businesses or low return loans then youre stuck in that position and that lowers your overall returns for the organization youre stuck with that for the length of that asset and so we do that from time to time to win new prospects and customers but we wouldnt want to make a practice out of deploying capital into low return businesses and so well see what the alternatives are but well continue to manage it the way we always have which is to be thoughtful stewards of capital and make sure were focused on returns mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just as a followup question clearly you and your peers have indicated that many of your customers have built up their liquidity in their deposit accounts because of these uncertain times can you compare this to the time period because we had the same phenomenon of customers building up liquidity how long did it take do you recall to have those customers bring those deposits down to a more normal level and what do you see for this cycle is it going to be as long as it was at the darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well my crystal ball is as good as yours gerard but i guess i look at the level of liquidity that we have this time i think people are smarter this time than they were last time i think the industry not the banking industry per se but the customers we bank have been a lot quicker to build liquidity have been a lot quicker to adjust their business operations to the revenue environment and thats why weve seen that build up i think part of what youre seeing in the liquidity also is the lack of alternatives of places where they can invest their excess cash right and it doesnt make a lot of sense to have it in sweep right now if youre a larger middle market client doesnt make sense to keep it in time and money market accounts if youre a small business or a consumer because there is no rate there and so were seeing it all sit liquid and what i think starts to happen is as things improve youll see some of it get deployed in hiring in building inventory and youll see some of it get deployed into higherreturning asset classes from the customers perspective to the extent that theyve got excess and how long that takes i think will be some combination of how quickly we see gdp recover and how quickly we see interest rate movement up from here i guess id just keep in mind that last time it took us until we probably got to or basis points on fed funds before people started to really move and pay attention to moving dollars out of savings and tie our savings and interest checking and checking into higheryielding types of products so i think were thinking its here for a while kind of next months hopefully not much longer but well see how the economy goes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate all the color thank you operator and id like to turn the floor back over to the management for any additional or closing remarks donald j macleod administrative vice president assistant secretary
