the conference over to mr edward wehmer wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you very much welcome everybody to our first quarter earnings call with me as always are dave dykstra dave stoehr kate boege who is remote so i dont have to shock collar on so im in great shape for today tim crane and rich murphy we indiscernible go with the same format as we always do im going to use some general comments regarding our results turn over to tim for more detail on the balance sheet dave dykstra will follow some details on income statement and rich murphy will comment on credit and then back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future and some questions after that all in all was a very good quarter and went pretty much according to plan asset growth may seem muted compared to prior quarters last year we had approximately billion per quarter and billion in the fourth quarter we noted probably half of the billion of growth was going to be transitory not like inflation but really transitory its related to the few big customers who experienced large liquidity events the end of the year does turn out to be the case so it appears we are back on billion growth level per quarter as were up just little over million in total assets net interest income and the margin both improved as expected basis points of the margin sans ppp and million net interest income despite two fewer days in the quarter indiscernible approximately million plus or minus the core deposit increase occurred late in the quarter so we expect to see further benefits moving forward this core deposit increase should provide up to million net interest income on an annualized basis but were all positioned for future rate increases loans grew at the upper end of our guidance at around so was very diversified pipeline has remained extremely strong keep saying credit cant get any better but it does npas and npls remained extremely low npa npls fell million million or of total loans npas decreased million to million or total assets these are incredible numbers for a billion bank indiscernible say so myself how to get much better but we will continue to try tim will discuss other income in detail i want to make one comment indiscernible valuation increases or decreases theyre very important part of our planning increases seen this quarter basically offset the oci effect higher rate on our tangible book value worked according to plan wealth management fees continued to grow our expenses were our expense growth was pretty much benign indiscernible i can repeat everything but million over the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of pretax pre provision of indiscernible anyhow im sorry pretax preprovision preprovision million indiscernible preprovision and margin at we feel pretty good about where we are right now and with that im going to turn over to tim who is going to cover additional detail on the balance sheet go ahead tim timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp great thanks ed in addition to the million and the loan growth important to note that period end loan balances excluding ppp were over million ahead of the quarter average which should help our second quarter results ppp loans continue to run down as they are forgiven and at roughly million at quarter end theyre no longer material and will largely be gone by midyear going forward while encouraged by growing pipelines we believe that loan growth in the mid to high single digits on an annualized basis remains a wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 reasonable expectation given the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook ed mentioned deposit growth of approximately million for the quarter this was influenced by a handful of very large client outflows related in most cases to funds that came to us in the fourth quarter and then left in the first quarter essentially in and out transactions that crossed yearend absent those outflows organic deposit growth continued as expected entering the second quarter we continue to watch deposit levels and expect some continued volatility from atypically large commercial transactions interestbearing deposit costs of basis points for the quarter was down basis points from yearend and likely represents the low point of the cycle while competitor deposit pricing remains muted we are starting to see increases in the most rate sensitive of the deposit categories an example would be municipal deposits that track some of the state investment indices on the investment front with rates increasing we deployed some liquidity during the quarter total investments were up approximately billion remaining patient in deploying our excess liquidity continues to benefit the bank as rates continue to rise at quarter end liquidity remained strong with an excess of billion yet to be deployed of note our securities book of billion is approximately available for sale held to maturity the rapid rise in rates resulted in unrealized losses on the afs securities that combined with dividends and net of the banks earnings resulted in a small reduction in tangible book value on a percentage basis this is of of the yearend tangible book as rising rates and rate sensitivity remain a topic of interest i want to reiterate some of what we discussed on the last quarters call first we remain very asset sensitive and wellpositioned to benefit from rising rates as shown in our presentation materials of our loans reprice or mature within a year to reinforce eds earlier comments were early in the rate cycle we continue to believe each basis point increase in rates will generate approximately million to million in pretax net interest income on an annualized basis and approximately a basis point improvement in the margin to be more specific on the margin for the quarter the margin improved basis points on a reported basis points excluding ppp on our last call we suggested that the consensus rate forecast could result in a margin approaching by yearend with more current projections its likely we will meet that target much earlier than anticipated and may approach by yearend on the capital front there was very little change in the banks capital as earnings supported the quarters growth capital remains appropriate on a riskadjusted basis lastly we continue to be pleased by our market momentum in past quarters weve highlighted the recognition the bank received from greenwich regarding the satisfaction of our commercial clients this quarter we learned the bank was ranked highest in retail customer satisfaction by jd power and associates for illinois for six consecutive years weve ranked first or second in customer satisfaction something were proud of and it speaks to the strength of our retail banking franchise with that ill hand it over to dave david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim as usual ill cover some of the noteworthy income statement categories starting with the net interest income for the first quarter of net interest income totaled million this was an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million as compared to the first quarter of wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 the components of the million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter are as follows million of the increase related to earning asset growth and an improvement in the net interest margin with that increase offset by approximately million less net interest income due to two fewer days in the quarter and another million decrease due to less ppp interest income in the quarter the margin improved basis points from the prior quarter to a beneficial decline of basis points for the rates paid on liabilities combined with the basis point increase on the yield on earning assets resulted in the improved net interest margin the increase in the yield on earning assets in the first quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the impact of investing a portion of our short term liquid assets into longer term higher yielding securities during the quarter resulting in an overall yield on our liquidity management assets increasing by basis points the decrease in the rate paid on net interestbearing liabilities in the first quarter of compared to the prior quarter is driven by a basis point decrease in the rate paid on net interestbearing deposits primarily due to lower repricing of time deposits i think its important again to note that the net interest income expanded despite less interest income from the ppp portfolio and the two fewer days in the quarter and also the net interest margin excluding the impact of the ppp portfolio increased by basis points turning to the provision for credit losses wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of million compared to a provision of million in the prior quarter and the million negative provision recorded in the yearago quarter provision expense in the first quarter was driven largely by loan growth excluding ppp loans of approximately million offset by a small decrease in net chargeoffs and an improvement in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including improving loan risk rating migration rich murphy will cover credit quality and additional detail in just a few minutes turning to the other noninterest income and noninterest expense sections in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue declined by million to a level of million in the first quarter this compared to million in the prior quarter but was up from amount recorded in the prior year the slight decline in revenue source was negatively impacted by lower equity market valuations which impact the pricing on a portion of our managed asset accounts along with slightly lower brokerage trading activity and associated revenue but all in all it was still a strong quarter for our wealth management division and were pleased with the results there consistent with overall industry trends and the impact of higher home mortgage rates our mortgage banking operations saw lower loan origination volumes during the first quarter with lock adjusted origination volumes down approximately this production volume was less than the gains we provided in the prior quarter earnings release due to the substantial rise in mortgage rates subsequent to that time however our mortgage banking revenue actually increased million to million in the first quarter of revenue was higher in the current quarter primarily due to a positive valuation adjustment on our portfolio of mortgage servicing rights this was offset by lower lock adjusted origination volume and a compressed production margin the company recorded a positive million valuation adjustment in the first quarter of related to the mortgage servicing rights compared to a positive valuation adjustment of million in the prior quarter the company purposefully build up its servicing portfolio for the last few years in order to not only maintain the customer relationship but to provide an economic hedge against the impact of rising rates on loan origination revenue although point in time msr valuation changes and fluctuations in quarterly origination volumes rarely work as perfect hedges the general relationship was effective this quarter and helped the company maintain strong overall mortgage banking revenue as the economy transitions to a higher rate environment the sharp and rapid increase in interest rates during the quarter that benefited the msr valuation in other segments of the company introduced headwinds though that impacted the mortgage production volume and wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 margins the impact of the volatility on secondary marketing results as well as competitive pressures were the drivers of the lower production margin reported during the quarter looking forward to the second quarter based on the current pipeline activity and the market conditions we expect mortgage originations to be very similar to the origination volumes experienced in the first quarter with production margins in the to range other noninterest income totaled million in the first quarter which was relatively stable with the million recorded in the prior quarter turning to noninterest expenses they totaled million in the first quarter of and were relatively consistent with the prior quarter total of million in fact looking back over the last six quarters total non interest expenses have remained on a very tight band ranging from million to million and the current quarter lands well within that range so the company has been able to control the overall noninterest expenses despite significant growth in the balance sheet over that time horizon despite the consistent level managed expenses there were a handful of categories that showed variance that ill address salaries and employee benefit expense increased by million from the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year the current quarter increase was primarily related to million of higher commissions and incentive compensation program expense due to higher accruals for our longterm and short term incentive compensation programs associated with the increased earnings level additionally approximately million of the increase was related to employee benefit expenses which were due to higher payroll taxes and 401k match contribution accruals which tend to be elevated in the first quarter of the year advertising and marketing expenses decreased by million from the first quarter the decrease relates primarily to reduced level of mass media and digital advertising campaign costs the miscellaneous expense category totaled million in the first quarter compared to million in the fourth quarter representing a decrease of million and this decrease was primarily impacted by a lower level of travel and entertainment expenses other than those expense categories just discussed no other expense category had a change of more than and all those expense categories in the aggregate were down by approximately million compared to the fourth quarter of the net overhead ratio a measure of operational efficiency stood at which is down basis points from the recorded in the fourth quarter the ratio benefited from increased mortgage banking revenue and i should note the efficiency ratio improved to in the first quarter from in the prior quarter which was aided by an improving net interest margin and gains on the msr portfolio during the quarter in summary core fundamentals were strong with growth in pretax preprovision income an expansion of the net interest income despite ppp loan reductions and the fewer days in the quarter improved net overhead and efficiency ratio strong loan pipelines and very good credit quality metrics so with that ill conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier by ed and dave credit performance for the first quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter net of ppp was just under million or annualized equally as important and similar to the past few quarters we saw loan growth across the portfolio specifically life insurance premium finance loans which were up million core cre loans wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 which were up million commercial premium finance loans which were up million and residential real estate and core ci loans both showed solid growth yearoveryear we saw total loan growth of billion or net of ppp loans this total included million of agency finance loans acquired from allstate indiscernible portfolio by the way continues to perform very well relative to the initial business case which we had laid out previously as noted on our prior earnings call we continue to see very solid momentum in our core ci and cre portfolios pipelines have been strong throughout this past four quarters and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings during the past several quarters we continue to be optimistic about loan growth for the remainder of for a number of reasons our core pipelines continue to be very strong with solid momentum in q1 line utilization as detailed on slide continues to trend up from to when netting out our mortgage warehouse lines we anticipate that this trend will continue also on slide youll see that business expansion and inflation pressures have resulted in many customers requesting increases to their credit facilities to help finance these costs and also wintrust life finance had another strong quarter growing their portfolio by on an annualized basis this momentum has been strong for several quarters and we believe it should continue through the better part of as a result while macroeconomic conditions may pose a heightened level of uncertainty we are reaffirming our loan growth guidance of mid to highsingledigit growth from a credit quality perspective as i pointed out hard to get much better and as detailed on slide we continue to see that this performance again was across the portfolio and it can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans decreased from million or basis points to million or basis points a meaningful part of this reduction came from the sale of an million portfolio of loans the majority of which were nonperforming npls continue to be at record low levels and roughly half of where we were this time last year chargeoffs for the quarter were at million approximately of which was a result of the loan sale i just mentioned as we continue and we continue to see reductions in our special mention and substandard loans as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks guys suffice it to say we like our position if all the prognosticators are correct on rate increases we should continue to perform extremely well im looking forward to seeing that indiscernible long time credit stats are terrific as indiscernible getting better were going to continue to try continue to call the portfolio for potential problems kind of scary that you could have one loan indiscernible almost double your npas right now but we keep looking deep and were going to continue to do that loan demand should remain strong through the year inflation should increase line usage numbers pipelines remain strong across the board acquisition opportunities have picked up a bit pricing expectation is still a bit of a detriment though and you can count on us not doing anything stupid in that regard very proud of the entire wintrust crew and their earning the jd power award yet again i read somewhere that our numbers would have put us in second place in the entire nation indiscernible winning seven greenwich awards again greenwich awards are for commercial banking side of the equation you have to wonder why people bank anywhere but wintrust indiscernible market disruption bodes well for continued organic growth wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 so indiscernible our best efforts we appreciate all your support and now its time for some questions thank you very much question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of david long of raymond james your question please david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi david how are you david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc i am doing well thank you can use a little bit better weather here in chicago though if you can help with that that would be great edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how about indiscernible this weekend hows that david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc that sounds spectacular thank you id appreciate it so a question i want to ask about is sort of indiscernible expenses mortgage banking revenue or the volume sounds like its going to be coming down and i think dave you discussed sort of the million to million range in expenses can you stay there and does the lower mortgage volume does that allow you to keep the expenses in that range for a little bit longer period david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well its a good question i do think the mortgage as volumes come down the mortgage expenses will come down some more we keep working on that so there is some positive expense numbers that come out of that as you know as you go into the second and third quarters our marketing expenses tend to go up a little bit because of the baseball season sponsorships and just the community sponsorships we do in the summertime and te tends to go up and we gave raises that go into effect in february so there are some increases in expenses that we might see in the second quarter we do think mortgage expenses will come down were certainly attempting to control the other expenses so there might be just a tad of overall increase but it shouldnt be extraordinarily high just maybe they bump up a little bit but can we keep them in that range possibly but might be just a little bit higher wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think you have to look at that overhead ratio which we expect to be right around between for the whole year about to somewhere in that so indiscernible in the first quarter to probably be around to i think the rest of the year would be a good number david j long a analyst raymond james associates inc yeah thats what we think if you took out the msr that we gained this quarter and just had a look at the rest of that excluding that valuation wed be in that to range so we think that thats reasonable and you have to understand that we do think the revenue in that scenario goes up quite a bit too with the margin increase so we still think that we have good operating leverage and well have growth on the balance sheet david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it got it cool and then as it relates to the rate hikes with the beach ball being released here and should see some acceleration in the net interest income how much of that falls to the bottom line will almost all that fall to the bottom line or does that allow you to take on any additional projects or are there any other expenses that youd have to add with several rate hikes edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible to wages inflation raging right now we will have to wait and see how that plays out but i would imagine that our midyear we usually dont like to do a lot of midyear increases but i think this year were going to have to keep everybody happy and in line i mean weve got a lot of good things going on here its all to our people weve got to keep our people happy because again theres a lot of poaching going on out there as we speak but a very deep bench and were able to fill where we do get poached and disruption in the markets helping a little bit there too in terms of being able to bring people in so i guess i would david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp probably i mean the other thing i mean people ask us all the time well if you make more money will you just invest a lot more into technology and some of those other initiatives and i think the answer we our approach on that is weve always sort of had a rolling threeyear initiatives plan and technology plan and investments to continue to increase the mobile and digital benefits that our customers see and our teams pretty full up from a resource capacity executing on that plan so are there things at the margin you might spend on it if you have it maybe but nothing significant because our play is full doing the things we plan to do anyway david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you thats all i had appreciate the time guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey ed maybe a question on just the overall rate profile id listened to conference call this morning about banks reaping the benefit but also taking down some of the rate sensitivity as we get rates priced in any thoughts about adding some swaps to just to mitigate some of it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp you mean on the downside christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah just the futures market is projecting cuts in a couple years like were going to raise and then were going to apparently cut so i was wondering if you is there a scenario where you would just mitigate some of the volatility edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thats the plan were finally in a position where we again can indiscernible rates go up and down but theyre pretty expensive right now we were fortunate when rates were really low when pandemic first hit put on some some derivatives have been helpful or will be helpful to us as rates continue to go up but indiscernible expensive right now but we continue to look at that understand its a vulnerability for us right now and we will continue to evaluate that to tighten the market a little bit and anybody else want to comment on that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well no i think that was right i mean its a little bit odd that were a month into the first increase and were already talking about decreases weve got another eight or so increases planned the market projects more into so we look at it every day chris wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and i would just say you can go back and look at our prior 10k and 10q disclosures and we have in the past put on forward starting derivative transactions to address that kind of a situation looking at the overall interest rate sensitivity of our entire balance sheet if you see those sort of opportunities sometimes the cheapest way to address that in the short run is a derivative contract and we certainly have done those in the past so we are looking at those things and well keep you apprised if we do it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay maybe one more your growth outlook has been i would say consistently strong above peers you run the capital structure more optimized than some of your peer im just interested given the outlook for growth and the remix of the balance sheet and also the concerns in the economy is there a scenario where you would just proactively come to market and just shore up the balance sheet even further to just make the capital position give you more flexibility david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well weve always talked about this in the past the way we look at that we like to be very efficient on our capital structure and we actually like leverage in our capital structure we like having preferred and subdebt and we even still have some old trust preferreds that are very efficient for us and so for us its sort of where you think growth is going to go if you look at this quarter we supported the growth and if you look going forward and these rate increases come through and your profitability goes up if you stay in this mid to highsingledigit loan growth area we can support that loan growth so i think what we need to just do is look and see whats the outlook for growth if it becomes sort of supersized then yeah to be opportunistic and raise capital to support that growth weve always been a growth company so we would look to do that but currently the earnings are supporting the growth and well just continue to monitor christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks dave operator thank you our next question comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp whats up jonny wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys maybe start with tim your comment i hate to ask the question but your comment on the margin by yearend what kind of rate assumptions are baked in to that commentary timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah jon weve got basis points from this point forward in so roughly in the second quarter and in the ensuing quarters your guess is as good as ours as to what it actually turns out to be jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right okay and then i guess the flip side of that question is in that kind of an environment how do you guys think about deposit pricing and deposit growth can deposit growth match loan growth in that kind of an environment without you guys having to really take up deposit rates edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well we probably will have to bring up deposit rates to attract some stuff but thats built into our overall plan here indiscernible built into tims tim gave his margin numbers momentum is still pretty good on the deposit here and the growth side we havent had a market product in a long time because stuff just came to us basically we just did a lot of name recognition stuff and in the past we always had market products and now indiscernible products again and see how that goes but it will cost a little bit more to grow we always say that but i think were far away its far outweighed by the asset sensitivity on the asset side jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah that makes sense timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp and jon we havent seen much market reaction so other than deposits that are sort of attached to indices at this point everybody seems to have been pretty disciplined jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it and i guess more the elephant in the room is just on mortgage and tim to your point whether or not basis points comes through but how would you guys think through that kind of a rate hike impact on production volumes with the mortgage company and kind of whats the strategy to deal with higher mortgage rates david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp indiscernible disconnect a little bit between indiscernible wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah i know different parts of the curve yeah david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp right so we consistently have been bringing in million or so or million of applications per month and we expect refinances are more fall off they were still kind of close to in the second quarter but my guess is thats going to be more purchase we positioned ourselves really well and tried to service the purchase market and do that out of our retail locations and with our local people being involved in the communities and the realtors and the like and so we still think that rates are indiscernible got our first mortgage at or wed still think mortgage isnt going to stop the purchase activity and so we think well gain more than our fair share of the purchase market so we still think that we can maintain the volumes that we have right now and well see there is a supply inventory of houses is hurting that a little bit too i think you could have more volume if there was more supply out there but we believe well pick up on the purchase side and lose on the refinance side but think right now based on what we know even with these sort of level mortgages that we can maintain the production volumes edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp and even jon even it doesnt when rates fall again people will be back just trying to market home equity loans again because the cycle is indiscernible rates go down and they refinance again so we expect lower rates and thats why were positioned indiscernible our margin goes up substantially to cover the mortgage side of the equation so i think that its working according to plan it wont always be perfect but the margin should cover a lot of the other problems in the in that in the drop in mortgage business and well make it up indiscernible rates go down it gives you mortgages and rates go up it gives you other opportunities so thats how its structured like we are david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp but and i think you have to think about that interplay that ed talked about about the margin on the mortgage but we have built into the revenue right now million million of servicing income yeah and then if you look at those projections the production income is what say million million a quarter but thats not falling to the bottom line because you have commissions and other expenses so the impact of the mortgage business now from a volatility perspective should be rather low going forward and should be sort of dwarfed by the changes in the overall rate environment and the earning asset base the related improvements there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats a good point yeah its clearly the balance pull through this quarter but i think addressing the mortgage thing helps so i appreciate it guys thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy of stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe a followup on jons question what are your thoughts about holding more mortgages on the balance sheet now that rates are higher and then while im kind of on the balance sheet just maybe talk about future deployment of excess liquidity into this investment securities portfolio richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i can talk a little bit about the arm we are seeing more arm production in the marketplace right now we do have some opportunity to hold more and this last quarter as i kind of pointed out in my remarks we did hold little more resi going forward i think youd probably see a very similar amount that we would hold probably for the second quarter we typically will do that infootprint as opposed to more of the national products but generally speaking i think that there is an opportunity there and we really like the space i mean we had in earlier years we had a lot of resi on our books over the past number of years weve had a substantial loan growth in other areas and we really didnt most people wanted 30year fixed and so we didnt so to eds point we take what the market gives us and right now its more arm production gives us that opportunity david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and then i guess on the securities portfolio we ended up billion in securities more at the end of the first quarter versus the fourth quarter so we did put some of those securities to work and you could see that that impacted indiscernible positively but the rate increases will also help on the short term liquidity earning there so for the time being were still going to be cautious and edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp opportunistic david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp opportunistic and replace the runoff maybe invest a little bit more but were not going to dive into the deep end and put all billion or billion of excess liquidity to work right now hopefully well start some of that up with loan production and then well continue to slowly leg into it i think wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then as a followup question ed in the press release you talked about gaining new market share i was wondering if you could expand on that is that kind of chicago milwaukee is that some of your national businesses and whats behind that statement edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp all the above i think theres plenty of room for us to continue to grow in chicago in our defined market area there are a number of branches being prepared for opening right now were only what of the market as it stands so chase and boa and bmo have to look out because were coming for them im sure theyre all shaking in their boots right now but probably hiding in the basement or something but plenty of room for us to grow here i think we can capitalize on the awards we continue to get in terms of service and as i said indiscernible we give the best service bar none our approach works in that regard high touch high tech stuff works really well but across the board we expect to have continued growth in all of our products and services get continued market share we expect that every year anyhow so it make any sense i terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc it did yeah i appreciate the color and its nice to hear its broadbased market share gains thank you operator thank you our next question comes from nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi nathan david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp good morning nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co a question on some balance sheet dynamics i appreciate some of the noninterestbearing deposit outflows was somewhat transitory in the quarter but also curious if thats a function of some of your commercial clients kind of sifting through all the excess liquidity levels that are accumulated over the last couple years as they work through those liquidity levels can we maybe perhaps expect some more of a meaningful increase in line utilization appreciate it was only up maybe or so in the first quarter so just trying to think about what the increase in line utilization potential maybe factors into that high single digit loan growth outlook for this year wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah as i pointed out in my comments i do think thats a its a nice tailwind that we have i think as we pointed out in the last several calls line utilization through the pandemic and over the last several quarters was definitely muted but now we are seeing or if you just look at our assetbased lending group and as they work through the requests from the our customers in terms of rising supply costs rising raw material costs youre definitely seeing utilization start trending up were also seeing expansion of the lines that are out there and you can see that in the what we included in our release showing that there are more and more customers coming in looking for expanded line facilities so its a good story for us and i think that thats over the course of the rest of the year it is going to be a real nice tailwind david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp nate to the first part of your question the deposit run out was really related more to a handful of large businesses that sold as opposed to a drawdown of liquidity although clearly there was a lot of liquidity in the system and we continue to watch how some of our commercial clients manage their deposits but the fourth quarter was more of isolated incident type situation nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood appreciate that color and changing gears and thinking about mortgage expenses dave when i think about kind of what you described about a year or so ago when we saw a pretty decent decline in volumes in the second quarter of last year you spoke to the potential for the commission line related mortgage to step down by about million or so is that a fair kind of starting point as well to think about the commission line into the second quarter within the context of what you spoke to in terms of just the overall expense run rate starting in david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well if origination volumes stay the same in the second quarter as the first quarter and the fourth quarter origination volumes if you kind of look at those relative to where they were in the prior quarter they came down a little bit but i would expect that because the first quarter was down from the fourth quarter the way it went through but youll see a little bit of a reduction in commissions but then if it flattens out and we stay stable i dont think youre going to see a dramatic decline because the production will be the same so i think youll see a slight decline in the second quarter in the commissions line just because of the production dynamics but then should level out and well have to see where production goes into the third and the fourth quarters nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood but just generally speaking there is a lag in your mortgagerelated expenses compared to revenue david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 yeah because we book the revenue based upon a locked production and the probability of close but we dont and that includes the net revenue number so sort of includes the discounted cash flow of the net revenue we do that on a locked basis but the commission expense doesnt flow through until the loans actually close nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood i appreciate all the color thank you guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp welcome operator thank you our next question comes from michael young of truist securities your question please michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question its great to see the strong growth again in the insurance book with life and property and casualty i know some of those areas particularly life will start to reprice into that higher 12month libor is that ever result in some choke off of demand in either the life book or the property and casualty book as rates rise edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp its interesting in my opinion not really because the crediting rate goes up too if they get any insurance policies so the credit rate goes up on the insurance policies the spreads still the same and they make out okay you follow me so indiscernible to take one of these policies out on your lets say indiscernible may be getting a credit rate of before and a and pay indiscernible on that now youre going to get or and pay so thats as long as that spread is there the spreads had actually contracted before theyre actually probably going to expand a little bit over time so it will make this product more attractive i think so and we still see richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp and rates really dont have an impact on the commercial premium finance book at all so thats more insurance premiums and whether youre having catastrophes or whatever its going on in the insurance rates but interest rates really dont impact the commercial premium side at all timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah talking to some of our customers in the life side they will tell you that there could be some effect with rising rates and particularly as ed points out if you dont have that crediting rate change that arbitrage gets maybe a little bit squeezed but you are seeing much more popularity of the product in general much more awareness out there so we think that theres its a very viable market and will continue to do well through this year as rates continue to rise but obviously that is something that were going to keep an eye on but that product as youve seen has seen dramatic uptick here over the course of the last couple years and i think it goes beyond just where the rate markets are wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah where we might see a problem is in terms of competition somebody will jump in and they try to steal market share and they think its an easy deal this is not an easy business you have to have real expertise indiscernible thats the value add we give is that expertise we have in terms of structuring these and indiscernible lot of places and if you do it the wrong way these guys will jump in and think its easy it aint easy so i would expect that would be a bigger issue than the market itself is competition coming in fighting over basis point or but most people are pretty happy with the service we give and the knowledge that were doing it right as opposed to some people where we have to jump back in and take it over and fix it and thats real pain in the neck we should be should get paid for those and we do but we they leave us and they come back and we have to fix it so its not easy business it seems like it is but it aint michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and thanks for that just another question just on the deposit side is there any interest to term out any deposits kind of earlier in the rate hike cycle to give more benefit later on or i know youve got a lot of cds kind of rolling through at pretty low pricing right now will a lot of those just roll off kind of how are you guys thinking about that book timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah i mean i think i guess theres two parts to that the retail client base is usually pretty aware of rates and so our cd book is down to of our deposits essentially we think theyll start to wade back into cds depending on the rates that get offered but you got to go pretty you got to go substantially higher to get people locked right now they know rates are going up and again were still pretty indiscernible the futures market and the expectations for a lot higher rates there really isnt much higher rates yet in the banks and so we havent seen anybody say theyre ready yet but well watch for it and as theres opportunities well certainly take those but you see some people out there now with for example rates around a year and they dont seem to be getting much traction so michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from ben gerlinger of hovde group your line is open benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp morning how are you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc im doing well thank you ed and dave i know you guys always you always have great color commentary for the broader economic outlook but when you guys think about kind of the mom and pop this lower level ci indiscernible really think the global geopolitical events ukraine or anything to that extent really has a lot of impact on their daytoday operations not nearly the extent that inflation does so when you think about just their operation their demand for loans and combating inflation do you think that theres any sense that they might be tightening the reins or potentially increasing loans to shore up the balance sheets or kind of how the lower level ci market is operating in todays environment and i get that indiscernible mid to highsingle digits is pretty clear but is there anything that could increase that outside of additional talent added to the team edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think inflation is the big deal right now indiscernible so we see people getting the costs small producers even are getting their costs theyre able to pass them through thats inflation the cycle is here the spiral is here we have to be very careful in terms of us getting more of that business yeah were always looking at more of that small business is very important to us were number one in illinois and in the sba loans and very important to us and were starting to expand that but rich do you want to comment richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no you hit the nail on the head i think generally speaking most of our customers would report that theyve been able to take those costs and move them through and pass them along and theyre doing pretty well i think overall the consumer is pretty healthy right now and so demand across the board is in pretty good shape whether its housing or auto or any areas that you look at and so a lot of the customers that we finance are supplying lower end suppliers in that space and so generally speaking i think theyre feeling pretty good i think as ed pointed out where the challenge the bigger challenges are just inflation wage pressure and having to battle that and trying to find good talented people thats probably the number one concern that people express to us i think what youre seeing is in a lot of spaces where people are really focused on efficiencies now theyre looking more at automation they want to spend the money and just try to make do with less and thats where we can help a lot our leasing group has reported lot of activity in that area lot of this line utilization is for people making the spend to get more efficient and ultimately i think its probably a pretty good thing but in the meantime its hard because people have to get through this period where talent is very expensive and hard to find edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp talent is a big part right now i mean especially we dont have a lot of hospitality at all we do have restaurants and the like but people they cant get people to work there indiscernible head of the sea island companies like they have positions open right now they cant fill them they cant bring people in from out of the country like they used to in the high seasons and the like so its really kind of jazzed right now in terms of that so we see a lot of that which means people have to pay more to get people to come and thats the inflation cycle like i said like a yearandahalf ago indiscernible transitory once it gets going its hard to stop but i think this think a lot of people are getting freaked out about inverted yield curve right now think thats a false positive right now because the government is still buying treasuries keep their costs down so i think those rates are artificially not in good shape its not really true so we dont see that right now as an issue but indiscernible we do but we will see the price lot of money is out there prices are being wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 accepted oil is a big issue in terms of commuting and what have you but just going to cost more to live like ronald reagan said indiscernible was free benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you no thats great and then kind of keeping on the same vein of talent i know from the inflation perspective of talent and then also chicago seems to have a noteworthy deal every other year so thats pretty much the gift that keeps on giving to wintrust simply because you guys have a great mousetrap so when you guys think about talent and the people of how to wintrust kind of shopping their resumes so to speak indiscernible compensation to come over to wintrust appropriate are people looking for too much and then kind of how guys are just approaching the market disruption in terms of additional talent adds edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp dave or rich will handle that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp okay well as we talked about in the past the disruption obviously continues to help us and theres a time lag and to your comment three or four events that continue to be beneficial to us i dont think were seeing anything atypical for commercial lenders and compensation we do see obviously the broader inflationrelated activities but we think were a good home for lenders we think we take very good care of customers and for a lot of our lenders thats their primary concern so i think well continue to benefit as the disruption continues to work its way through the market edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we see it a lot at the lower levels we run a credit analyst program with guys people every year come through after two years they are offered godawful amount of money they go away and ever want to come back when its done but they realize that they left the golden goose but rich you want comment richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no i would say exactly what tim said where we brought in a lot of people out of some of the because of the market disruption over the course of the last couple of years and i think when you talk to those bankers about the culture and the fit what they would say is this is their number one job is keeping their customers happy and so our job is to make sure that we have the systems in place we have the credit process in place and we can deliver what we say because thats just been i think a bit of a trick out there in the marketplace as theres been acquisitions and different cultures come in and when a banker feels unsure about ability to deliver thats way more motivation than anything else and so weve been able to i think keep our bankers and our customers happy by just keeping a very core philosophy of consistency and thats just not what weve seen in the marketplace at all so fortunately weve been able to hold on to our bankers pretty well benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc all right thats great i appreciate it thanks guys wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys so wanted to follow up on the loan growth outlook the pipeline sound pretty strong if i heard you correctly you said theyre building just wondering if you could quantify what the pipeline looks like versus yearend david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp we dont we took the sort of the pipeline commentary out of that just because its just always a theres some timing issues and some other things that go into it and so we just really are focusing on the loan growth guidance but generally speaking the term building is the right term we did see good momentum here in the first quarter and as we go into the second quarter and that momentum really is again pretty broad based were seeing it in cre were seeing it in ci were seeing it in some of these line increases that were being asked to provide so generally speaking i would stick with that but getting beyond in terms of the specifics and were trying to get away from that really focus on the loan growth guidelines specifically indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and just to clarify the fed hike forecast i think you said basis points is that what you expect the fed to be at by yearend versus the bps level we are at today or are you expecting basis points of hikes incremental hikes between now and yearend david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah basis points from here in the second quarter and basis point changes in quarters three and four casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp whether that again whether that happens or not who knows casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp right so our thought on that is million to million per basis point increase and so you pick your scenario on a probably the math and go from there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp and obviously as we get into future quarters we will have started to realize some of that benefit and so the base will change over time but were again still early in the real cycle of rates changing here operator thank you at this time id like to turn the call back over to edward wehmer for closing remarks sir edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you everybody for listening in and we appreciate your support
