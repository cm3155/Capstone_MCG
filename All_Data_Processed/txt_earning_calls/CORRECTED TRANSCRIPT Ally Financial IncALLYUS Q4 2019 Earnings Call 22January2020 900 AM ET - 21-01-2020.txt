drive strong riskadjusted returns our dealer base has expanded for straight quarters resulting in relationships with over of us franchise dealers moving forward our focus is to continue in strengthening and deepening relationships with our dealer partners our insurance division continued to enhance our dealer value proposition evidenced by the billion in written premiums we generated in a increase yearoveryear and the highest volume in over a decade turning to our deposit and consumer bank product offerings we saw sustained progress throughout the year deposit balances ended at billion for the year driven by retail deposit growth of billion this represented yearoveryear growth nearly times the industry growth rate we added another deposit customers ending at million overall

balances came to ally from traditional banks our industryleading retention reflects the combination of our awardwinning digital experience bestinclass customer service and consistently competitive rates our deposit portfolio is now within the range of our core funding financial objective representing an important milestone for us this should not imply we take our foot off the gas with respect to deposit inflows deposits are central for funding customers are a terrific asset that we want to grow we simply say this as a testament to how far weve come in scaling our deposit book ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 ally home dtc originations of billion during the year represented an increase of yearoveryear the focus of our team and the growing partnership with bettercom drove our ability to deliver a meaningfully differentiated alldigital experience for our customers and positions us well as we head into ally invest selfdirected accounts grew yearoveryear obviously there have been a lot of changes in the market and players in this space over the past year were focused on adapting to these conditions and industry changes we closed on the health credit services acquisition during the quarter and are rebranding this offering as ally lending we acquired a portfolio of around million and generated million in new volume were encouraged by the early results and see strong potential in our ability to generate highquality growth and incremental profits across our established and expanding consumer offerings turning to corporate finance heldforinvestment loans of billion grew yearoveryear asset expansion this quarter was a result of execution by experienced teams including those related to new verticals launched in our approach to credit and underwriting remained disciplined and consistent throughout the year keep in mind the strong track record of this portfolio over the past years averaging around basis points in losses on capital management we distributed billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends an increase yearoveryear our allin yield exceeded placing ally among the highest ccar participating banks and we just announced another uptick in the common dividend to begin in february and during the quarter sp upgraded allys investment grade the second major rating agency to do so in reflecting the overall strength and position of our company this was an exceptional year for ally lets turn to slide number we were pleased to close out the year by meeting or exceeding every metric we provided in our outlook in january of last year we accomplished this against the backdrop of heightened interest rate volatility that weighed on the banking sector jenn will provide you with our summary outlook in a few moments but in short financial progress will accelerate in which reflects the embedded tailwinds that are unique to ally and a continuation of strong operating trends across our businesses lets move to slide number to review our key metrics in the upper left adjusted eps was per share in the fourth quarter an increase compared to the prior year period adjusted total net revenue remained above billion again this quarter in the bottom left deposits grew to billion as tangible book value on the bottom right increased to per share a increase yearoveryear across these metrics you can see the ongoing trends of improved results and the intrinsic value that weve continued to build and with that ill hand it to jenn to take you through the detailed financials jennifer laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb and good morning everyone in we delivered another year of sustained financial progress through operating discipline and consistent execution against our objective on slide adjusted eps of has more than doubled since representing a cagr over this timeframe fullyear core rotce of increased or basis points over the past five years excluding the impact from lower rates on oci rotce was modestly favorable to our ongoing financial progress has resulted from momentum across all of our businesses disciplined capital deployment and a healthy macroeconomic backdrop ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 revenue trends are on slide we exceeded billion in revenues an increase of billion or a increase since over this timeframe weve averaged annual revenue growth through three fundamental drivers first momentum across every business within auto and insurance weve diversified and deepened our dealer relationship increasing application flows and improving riskadjusted returns in mortgage we established a growing pipeline of directtoconsumer origination through a strong partnership with bettercom and in corporate finance we have continued to grow prudently by hiring experienced teams in new verticals second transformation of our funding profile since deposits have more than doubled to billion and now represents of funding a percentage point increase while unsecured debt with an average coupon of has declined by over billion and third dynamic and effective interest rate risk management weve managed repricing dynamics across our balance sheet resulting in predictable and stable net interest margin and net financing revenue growth every year the task were on reinforces our ability to execute and solidifies our expectation to drive accelerated revenue and net interest margin expansion a key differentiator for ally moving to slide lets look at earning asset trends we ended with billion in earning assets representing growth of billion since riskweighted assets have grown billion demonstrating capital efficient expansion we expect continued growth across our business lines while investment security growth will be more tempered as weve neared our objective since retail auto lending has expanded by billion more than offsetting lease balance declines of billion and a reduction of million in lease net revenue our full spectrum lending capability combined with a broader reach across the market without ties to one manufacturer or product type has led to increased outflow consistently strong volumes and attractive riskadjusted returns lets turn to slide adjusted efficiency ratio for full year was and operating expenses were just over billion insurance related expenses shown in the top portion of the chart grew yearoveryear reflecting elevated weather impacts in relative to historically low losses in and variable commissionbased expense supporting ongoing written premium and revenue growth all other expenses of billion grew yearoveryear reflecting a slow pace relative to last years level these trends are consistent with objectives weve provided centered around our core business growth and disciplined investments in technology and brand revenue growth will outpace expense growth again in driving further improvement to our adjusted efficiency ratio lets turn to slide to go through our detailed results net financing revenue excluding oid for the fourth quarter of billion declined on a linked quarter basis in line with our expectations as we discussed on the call last quarter the decline was driven by several components we anticipated including lower lease gains reflecting seasonality and lower per unit gains on trucks and suvs lower commercial balances reflecting a fouryear low in industry inventory levels and including impacts from the strike and the effect of lower benchmark rates which resulted in increased premium amortization and impacted certain products with contractual resets despite these impacts this result was our third highest quarterly nii result over the past five years and more importantly we are reiterating our expectation for that net financing revenue will exceed billion while net interest margin will expand by double digits revenue growth will be driven by many of the same drivers youve heard from us before including the embedded benefits of rising retail auto portfolio yields and our improving funding profile adjusted other revenue of million increased million quarteroverquarter and million yearoveryear driven by strong investment gains and growth in earned premiums within our insurance segment we expect an ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 ongoing quarterly trend for this line item in the million to million range provision expense of million increased million quarteroverquarter and million yearoveryear variance to the prior quarter reflected seasonally higher ncos credit performance was strong throughout and origination profiles remained consistent across credit attributes we assessed including ltv fico term dti and pti noninterest expense increased million quarteroverquarter and million compared to the prior year driven primarily by volumebased activities where fullyear auto applications increased yearoveryear deposit accounts expanded and written premium volume increased and ongoing investment in technology and brand ally ranks among the top five fastestgrowing bank brands in the us while our awareness scores are at the highest levels on record also reflected in expenses in the quarter where hcsrelated impact moving to quarterly key metrics at the bottom gaap and adjusted eps were and per share core rotce of adjusted efficiency ratio was and our effective tax rate was our normalized full year tax rate of adjusts for the q2 valuation allowance release slightly favorable to our full year expected range of to lets move to slide net interest margin excluding oid of declined basis points quarteroverquarter driven primarily by lower lease gains full year nim of was basis points below prior year and in line with our outlook to remain relatively stable despite significant rate volatility we continue to be relatively neutral to rates and feel confident about the strong interest rate risk profile of our balance sheet while we continue to prefer a steeper curve we are not overly dependent on rates to improve our margin overall asset yields decreased on a linked quarter and prioryear basis driven by seasonally lower lease gains and declining benchmarks impacting commercial auto mortgage and investment security portfolio yields these impacts were partly offset by the continued expansion of retail auto yield weve shown the retail auto portfolio yield excluding the hedge a tool we use in our overall management of interest rate risk as the hedge impact was somewhat elevated linked quarter importantly we continue to expect the portfolio to migrate closer to new volume yields as weve generated seven consecutive quarters of new retail origination yields above lease portfolio yield was for the quarter full year used car values declined approximately yearoveryear outperforming our expectation and declined over in q4 we continue to embed a to used car value decline in our financial projections for reflecting supply dynamics floorplan balances declined quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear reflecting the reduced inventory levels i mentioned earlier turning to funding trends remained favorable with cost of funds declining basis points quarteroverquarter as mix and pricing trends continue to improve across our products retail deposits grew billion during the period and we remain steadfast in our drive to increase value for our customers while being disciplined in our pricing approach yearoveryear unsecured balances declined another billion on slide well cover some deposit highlights in the upper right total deposits ended at billion driven by retail growth our 40th consecutive quarter where we generated doubledigit percentage growth in our portfolio on a yearoveryear basis we achieved record deposit and customer growth this year even as we reduced rates and competition increased including higher priced alternative offerings from established and emerging players customer retention levels remained at an industryleading our customers continue to demonstrate strong loyalty to ally reflecting our overall value proposition and the longterm stability of the platform ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 in the bottom left retail deposit rates declined basis points linkedquarter reflecting pricing actions over the past several months as our mix remains consistent and as jb mentioned we reached our objective to be funded with deposits this is a significant achievement and provides us with increased flexibility around our growth needs and pricing strategy we will continue to balance margin opportunities with a relentless focus on delivering strong value for our customers we were recently recognized as the best online bank by money magazine for the seventh time maintaining our customers trust and loyalty will remain at the center of our strategy on the bottom right we added new deposit customers during the year a continuation of the record setting trend weve seen over the past couple years existing customers drove of growth or billion in the highest level weve observed demonstrating the overall strength of the consumer and the desire of our customers to grow their relationships with us lets move to capital on slide cet1 of was stable linkedquarter and yearoveryear reflecting earnings growth and our focused approach in managing riskweighted assets we continued repurchasing shares during the quarter since mid2016 we produced shares outstanding by and weve returned over billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends our approach to capital management remains unchanged as we proactively assess growth opportunities we continue to prioritize delivering unique customer value and maximizing longterm shareholder returns on slide weve included a page on cecl perspectives we expect to report a day reserve increase of or billion at the low end of our expected range of to this represents an estimated cet1 impact of basis points to basis points given the expected increase in complexity and volatility associated with cecl were providing you with an early look at our disclosures beginning with our q1 filing we plan to attribute allowance impacts from nco activity in the portfolio changes in growth or portfolio size and all other drivers including portfolio mix and macroeconomic variable changes our approach includes a oneyear reasonable and supportable forecast followed by a 24month linear reversion to the mean variables we use including unemployment are based on historical data beginning from the great recession in january of through the current period our intention is to be balanced and transparent in our approach and as we learn more this year we will continue to augment and refine our disclosures even as the transition to lifetime loss reserving represents a significant increase to our existing allowance and a new normal for reporting we continue to reiterate the underlying risk profile of our balance sheet and lifetime loan profitability does not change lets turn to slide to review asset quality details consolidated net chargeoffs were basis points this quarter increasing basis points yearoveryear in the top right consolidated provision expense was million an increase of million compared to the prior year due to higher asset balances and modestly higher auto ncos in the bottom left the retail net chargeoff rates increased basis point yearoveryear to reflecting consistent origination trends strong used vehicle values and continued consumer strength in q1 we expect around basis points in higher retail auto ncos due to a system conversion that ill discuss momentarily so provision will not be impacted 30plus and 60plus delinquencies in the bottom right increased yearoveryear by basis points and basis points respectively reflecting the increased mix of use and seasoning of our portfolio and servicing approaches that have consistently resulted in improved ph for the loss trends activity and trends in credit performance remains fully aligned with our expectations ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 on slide auto finance pretax income of million declined million linkedquarter and increased million compared to prior year net financing revenue growth was driven by retail auto asset growth and increasing portfolio yields we decisioned nearly million apps a yearoveryear increase and our strongest fourth quarter ever moving forward we will continue to focus on generating strong riskadjusted returns through application volume growth and increased dealer penetration as i mentioned a moment ago we deployed a new core consumer servicing and accounting platform in january we converted million customer contracts the largest system conversion in our companys history this modern platform is highly adaptable and scalable and fully integrates with our customer facing and internal platforms we have been planning for this transition for a while and this successful rollout positions us well for the future in the bottom right you can see the progress weve made over the past several years expanding retail auto portfolio yields which will continue as the portfolio migrates closer to new origination yields while losses have continued to stabilize or improve benchmark declines persisted through along with a heightened level of competition in auto but through our expansive dealer network we generated strong riskadjusted returns and volume within our mid billion stated objective turning to slide we originated billion of consumer loans and leases in the quarter growth in used volume accounted for and of originations percentage points lower than prioryear periods as we saw strong increases in lease from an underwriting perspective our average fico of and nonprime volume of in the quarter remained consistent in the bottom left consumer assets grew yearoveryear to billion as lease balances moved slightly higher and retail loans grew by billion and on the bottom right average commercial balances of billion declined yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter as dealer inventories reflected industry and strikerelated impacts on slide insurance reported core pretax income of million in the quarter an increase of million linkedquarter and million versus prioryear earned revenue increased million yearoveryear reflecting strong written premium trends over the past several quarters written premiums of million in the period represented the highest q4 since becoming a publicly traded company driven by increased volume and rates across our product offerings slide has our corporate finance segment results core pretax income of million was up million linked quarter and million yearoveryear ending hfi asset levels grew million during the quarter while year overyear assets increased by over billion with of the growth in assetbased products credit performance remained strong and in line with our expectations were very pleased with the highly diversified nature of this portfolio and the accretive returns it generate on slide mortgage pretax income of million was down versus prior quarter and prior year periods reflecting the impact of premium amortization as rates declined and prepayment activity increased and impacts from our prior quarter loan sale of million that generated gains that did not repeat we originated over billion of directtoconsumer loans the first quarter to exceed this level and the fifth consecutive quarter of increased origination volume of originations were sourced from existing ally customers while of originated volume was generated through our partnership with bettercom we remain very pleased with the all digital platform and streamlined customer experience provided through this partnership evidenced through our strong customer nps reduced cycle times and improving cost per loan let me wrap up on slide with our fullyear expectations we expect to build upon our momentum in driving increased eps expansion and solid return on equity results keep in mind this reflects a stable reserve ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 under cecl expansion in eps and rotce will be driven by top line revenue growth of to fueled by ongoing execution across our business lines and driving positive operating leverage we remain focused on disciplined expense management and improved efficiency ratio demonstrated by our expectation to lower this metric by basis points to basis points in looking at retail auto net chargeoffs we expect to be on a low end of our stated to nco range driven by our consistent underwriting trends and a healthy consumer backdrop in closing we had a strong year with growth in pretax and preprovision income while we generated operating leverage gains this led to achieving our full year financial objective and positions us for accelerated improvement in and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks jenn on slide ill spend a few minutes reviewing our strategic priorities for in well build upon the operating and financial momentum weve established our dominant auto and direct deposit franchises that have tremendous scale are well positioned to

associates operate weve created a place where people enjoy working and are proud to say theyre employed at ally weve altered our benefits and philosophies to make our employee value proposition even stronger weve created one of the most passionate and inclusive environments for all of our teammates this leads to lower turnover deeper pride and energy well above industry average engagement scores

ally financial inc sure operator please tee up the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question is from ryan nash from goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning jb good morning jenn jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so jb thanks for all the color on the auto business i wanted to start with the competitive environment so youve been able to expand auto yields almost basis points throughout the year given the shift towards used and the continued optimization of the portfolio however weve now heard others talking about competition increasing particularly in parts of the market where you play so just wanted to get a sense for what youre thinking competitively and what you think this means for origination yields going forward and i have a followup jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sure sure thanks for the question ryan so i mean obviously weve stayed in tune the past couple of days with other key competitors in the space kind of in their commentary what id say is were not really feeling it yet its still particularly in the bank space a pretty rational environment now so were confident and continuing with the origination trends at similar levels youve seen from us over the past couple of years obviously weve been pretty consistent in doing billionish a quarter and i think in terms of pricing power we still feel really good about where things stand obviously for us what maybe makes us a little more unique is just the scale we have within auto the deep relationships we have and then obviously the outreach for us i mean were seeing a lot more application flow this year and this just gives us confidence in our ability to a book originations and b book them at very attractive levels so for us not really feeling it yet but obviously mindful that its a dynamic environment out there ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then maybe a followup on credit thanks for the color on cecl the impact will largely be driven by growth you just talked about origination so how should we think about earning asset growth and then second given your credit outlook of the low end of the targeted range what are you assuming in terms of used car prices going forward thanks ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure ryan so on your first question on earning asset growth look as we go into we see opportunities to grow across all of our portfolios well continue to find opportunities in retail auto and to jbs comments were not seeing any slowdown there we outperformed our mid billion origination target and pricing continues to be robust so were growing in retail auto and opportunistic in that portfolio corporate finance grew over over billion this year well continue to find opportunities in that portfolio and then some of our newer products you see dtc mortgage ramping up really nicely this year were pretty close to that billion target we set well continue to look for opportunities in mortgage and then hcs is just getting off the ground but good trends there so far so i would think about growth along the same lines as growth we will be slowing down investment securities a bit we kind of hit our funding our target portfolio mix target for securities so thatll slow down a bit but the loan categories will grow in line with and then onto credit i mean weve been guiding towards lower used car prices for some time now to on a fullyear basis we did outperform that fourth quarter we did see some softening it showed up in nii and in our nim and were projecting that to go down about to next year and thats really what drives up our nco rate to the low end of that to range ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for all the color jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc absolutely jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks ryan operator thank you our next question is from moshe orenbuch from credit suisse your line is now open moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and very impressive kind of growth on the deposit front particularly given the moves youve made on pricing just curious if you could kind of talk a little bit about your views as to how that kind of goes into this year and next do you see that just the online space just continuing to take share i mean how will you be able to continue to do that jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure moshe i appreciate the nice comments and we agree were very pleased with the performance of our deposit business and we dont see any signs of that slowing down and in fact you see the record volume and the record customer growth and thats in spite of the increased competition as well as taking rates down on kind of peak osa rate of down to and so well continue to optimize really across our customer strategy thats a very important part of our continued expansion into new products we want to continue to grow ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 our customers well be mindful of the value were providing but were also going to be focused on margin and osa i mentioned the decrease weve had that will roll forward into and create that nice doubledigit nim expansion i talked about and then on cd cd is right now were about theyll be rolling off around so well see some nice margin lift on the cd front as well but id say overall no change to our strategy we continue to find opportunities to grow both deposits and customers and its a great place to be to have the margin expansion come with that moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and could you talk a little bit about the kind of evolution of ally lending and in terms of you had spent a lot of money during q4 you had mentioned as part of that process of kind of getting them up and running but how does that kind of get to a more i guess normal efficiency and maybe what that means for the prospect of incremental acquisitions as you go forward jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and im not sure i would say a lot of money its a very very small amount in terms of the expense increase just as a reminder we really like this business the market is about billion its growing at almost and the variable riskadjusted margin is kind of in that range roa in the to range and rotce above so moshe our focus is really around ramping up growth in the portfolio making sure we get the right marginal return profile and over time were very confident that well see the total financial profile accelerate into and moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks so much jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you moshe operator thank you our next question is from betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side you indicated earlier that your systems conversion occurred in january and when i look at the outlook for operating leverage this coming year and your guidance obviously ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 better than what youve been generating over the past year which is solid but youve got an acceleration ramp in there so i just wanted to understand how much of that is coming from the systems conversion benefit that you should be getting this year and then if you could speak to other levers that are driving that outlook thanks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and betsy i think you captured it nicely i mean we are focused on positive operating leverage that is what we delivered here in that is again our focus in and you see that in our efficiency ratio guidance coming down basis points to basis points in terms of the overall expense story for q4 really for fullyear and into its all the same themes that weve been talking about its variable cost attached to growing our businesses q4 we had an outsized impact from insurance because weve hit record highs in terms of written premiums and earned premiums and so we see variable cost attached to our insurance business we also have grown as youve seen our application flow on the auto side of yearoveryear deposit accounts up so well continue to see that variable cost increase in line with revenue and then we continue to invest in brand and technology the system conversion thats been largely capitalized so thatll roll forward into but keep in mind thats embedded in the guidance that were giving around positive operating leverage and then last but not least some modest investments in new products hcs obviously hit this quarter so id say pretty modest in terms of that new product impact betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so the systems conversion really isnt an outlier in terms of its impact on the efficiency outlook jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc well i mean its embedded in our guidance there it was a pretty material investment that we made you think about weve completely upgraded our whole servicing platform in the auto business which was over million accounts and by the way huge shoutout to the team who accomplished that i mean we had almost no friction in terms of the conversion and customer feedback has been really strong todate so weve kind of hit that big milestone the expenses will roll forward in depreciation kind of over the next couple of years but its embedded in the guidance we provided for jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc betsy its been the effort thats been literally underway for about five years inside the company and as jenn pointed out we just successfully rolled it out after the turn of the year but amazing effort particularly given how minimal customer disruption was experienced over kind of three to four days when youre converting over million accounts that was quite impressive but from a financial perspective its already been partially embedded and well have a little bit more to come betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you operator thank you our next question is from sanjay sakhrani from kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks and good results i guess maybe we could tease out a little bit sort of what the hcs acquisition means to and maybe over the near term could you just talk about sort of how we expect it to factor into growth jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure and good morning sanjay on hcs we had modest impact here in q4 next year its really going to depend on the growth opportunities that weve seen weve brought over about a million portfolio had some modest costs there and some modest provision we originated about million in new originations this quarter and we want to ramp that up as quickly as possible but the total impact for number one will be pretty immaterial and number two itll depend in large part around the opportunities that we see were new in this space and so were going to be thoughtful about how we pace it and the growth that we are confident and weve embedded into our outlook and we also that business is largely focused on healthcare we are also looking for opportunities in other verticals home improvement in particular and auto where weve got a very expansive dealer network and we see some good synergies there sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and when you say home improvement you mean like personal lending with home improvement or something else jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah pointofsale lending with home improvement consumer investments sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and you guys would grow that organically or through acquisition jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc we have the platform so the acquisition that we closed on in october is largely a purchase of a platform so that would be an organic expansion of that platform into new verticals sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 okay got it and one final followup question on used car prices and remarketing gains that dropped pretty significantly in the fourth quarter is there anything to read into that and sort of how we should expect it to progress over the course of this year jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sanjay we were expecting that and weve been expecting lower used vehicle values for some time in q4 specifically we saw trucks and suv values declining a bit and thats just the phenomenon weve been talking about around the supply side dynamics where we hit here in the peak continues in and then it does start to subside actually in but we should see some nearterm pressure which is why weve continued to guide down in a to used vehicle prices in but to us not a big surprise and it was in our forecast sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure thank you operator thank you our next question is from eric wasserstrom from ubs your line is now open eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc thanks very much jenn i wanted to just circle back on a couple of issues related to the net interest margin i was backing to the marginal origination yield on auto from the bottom of slide in the fourth quarter im getting a number of around is that ballpark correct jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc the origination yield in q4 thats pretty close above eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc so its fullyear and in q4 indiscernible have some seasonality so it came down a bit eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay so in terms of the doubledigit nim expansion guidance how should we frame out what yield that implies ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and keep in mind the doubledigit nim expansion is really reflective of a lot of drivers the auto origination yield is a part of that so well expect our current portfolio which is fullyear about in origination yields to migrate up towards that over origination yield that weve been putting on the books for the last seven consecutive quarters and in we expect new origination yields to remain above so theres just this natural tailwind in terms of the repricing up you saw this year we had a basis point increase in new origination yields which translated into basis point increase in the portfolio those trends will continue into so thats kind of driver number one driver number two is what i talked about a little bit earlier around our deposit portfolio as weve repriced down osa that rolled forward into and then with the cd deposit repricing that creates a tailwind as well and then other dynamics weve got over billion in unsecured rolling down at over coupon and so weve got some nice liability management tailwinds there as well so all of that will contribute to that doubledigit margin expansion next year eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc and just on that last point and this is my last question and then ill get off but jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc the unsecured back of the envelope i was calculating about basis points of nim benefit from the shift from the repayment of the highcost debt again is that ballpark correct jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc eric i dont have the exact number right in front of me but i think its a bit higher than that and it depends a little bit on the timing weve got one we had almost billion coming off in the first quarter at over to coupon so the timing of it matters as well and we can followup with the exact math but i think basis points seems a little bit low eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks very much jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you eric ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob wildhack from autonomous research your line is now open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys youve talked a lot about the dealer account obviously something thats grown nicely in the past few years can you give us some context around the growth in performance thats coming from the expansion of the dealer account versus the success youre having on a per dealer basis and then what you think the growth levers and opportunities are from here thanks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah hi rob i would say the growth that were seeing in application volume is really coming from both the dealer account and deeper penetration into those dealers i will say with the number of consecutive quarters we have growth in dealer account and the fact that we have relationships with of dealers that the goforward priority will be around apps per dealer about 70pluspercent of our dealers give us less than five apps per month and we see tremendous opportunity in increasing apps and quality of the dealer relationship so thats really going to be the focus going forward continuing to bring in more apps more looks and then increase the quality of what we originate and continue to expand the riskadjusted returns but it does shift a bit from count to quality thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc rob maybe the only other point there is you asked about performance id say its been very consistent with we havent seen the new dealers have been onboarded maybe in the past months or so really performed any differently from a credit perspective on accounts so its been very consistent with the rest of the book robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thats great thank you guys jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks rob operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin barker from piper sandler your line is now open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 thank you in regards to your comments on cecl which i thought were very helpful could you provide some quantification around the incremental impact to your provision expense in given what youve laid out there i understand youre going to keep reserves to low and stable but just overall the impact on provision expense jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so kevin i think youre getting at some of the day impacts so as weve put our guidance out there weve been mindful of where were growing the portfolio and we are seeing growth across every single one of our businesses but weve embedded in there those increases in reserves so retail auto will be growing modestly were now reserving at over versus the we were reserving before and thats all embedded in the guidance that we gave you but its a fairly modest impact as we head into now we have to keep in mind thats what we know there are factors here that well have to continue to work through as were new to cecl and thats around just the macroeconomic variable changes if we seeing growth opportunities in the portfolio we want to continue to originate at strong riskadjusted returns and not let cecl hold us back so there are some unknowns there and then the last thing id say about cecl is with the way in which weve approached the reversion to the mean we have included the great recession and so weve got kind of an embedded kind of headwind just from the macroeconomic assumptions that weve made thats already embedded in there and that should reduce some of the volatility as we go forward just from a macro perspective kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co so will it be fair to say that youre taking a more conservative view on the economic outlook and assuming somewhat of a slowdown versus what wide industry standards in order to just remain conservative around the provisioning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean what i would say is weve just been very balanced in how weve looked at just the longer term trend in the portfolio and the assumptions that weve made are all embedded in the day kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then would this the implementation to cecl have an impact on how you think about certain asset classes that are currently on your balance sheet that may be lower yielding but may be tougher to hold in a post cecl environment jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look i mean were always trying to optimize yield and riskadjusted returns but thats not related at all to cecl as i mentioned in my prepared remarks i mean has nothing changed in terms of the longterm profitability of our various portfolios and we want to continue to focus on whats important to us which is driving value for our customers and longterm shareholder value as well kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 thank you for taking my questions jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc absolutely thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick shane from jpmorgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question look we spent a lot of time thinking about asset and liability mismatches id like to think about this in a slightly different way which is sort of compare your asset gathering franchise with your deposit gathering franchise it strikes me one as a traditional business and i dont mean that in a pejorative way where the other is very cuttingedge and innovative and youve cited the awards youve received im curious when you look at those customer bases what differences you see particularly from a demographic perspective and how will that evolve over time will you see convergence jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah rick i appreciate the question and yeah i think we are innovative across all of our businesses i wouldnt say just on the deposit side and in auto you can see a lot of the partnerships that weve created with some of the new entrants has positioned us very well for the modernization of auto and we will continue to lead in that space and then i look at what were offering through bettercom is a absolute top notch fully digital endtoend customer experience it has some of the highest nps scores across the industry and i would say we are absolutely leading and cuttingedge in terms of the product that we have out there and id say the same thing with what we just acquired the new platform with hcs now ally lending we are leaders in that space as well and well continue to grow and lead in there so our goal is to be innovative across all products not just on the liability side but also on the asset side jb i dont know if you want to add anything in there but jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc no jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc we dont see this big difference across the two and i just i mean you did ask about customer profile and our deposit base tends to be more of a mass affluent customer from a balance perspective but were growing millennials at a very rapid pace from an account number point of view and we do see overlap certainly overlap in terms of the ally lending customers were bringing in bettercom and mortgage i mentioned the of the new originations are coming from the existing deposit business so we certainly see a lot of overlap across all of our businesses on the asset and liability side and even with invest richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 got it no and look i appreciate that you need to be innovative across all of your business products i really i like the answer to the second part of the question in terms of that customer profile im curious when you look at it have you had more success selling loans to depository customers or deposits to borrowing customers jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc its the former its mining our deposit business for new asset opportunities and mortgage is a great example of that and then not just outside of lending but in the invest space over a third of our new invest customers come from the deposit platform and as we continue to add new products into invest and advisory capabilities we see that very tight connection only continuing to grow richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you guys for your time jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks rick operator thank you our next question is from john hecht from jefferies your line is now open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thank you guys very much most of my questions have been asked and answered first one is out of curiosity jenn it seemed like you suggested that the day impact was modest im wondering are you able to share with us is it our adjusted eps in the guidance would it have been higher under the accrual method or would it have been generally in the same range jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc it would have been higher and thats just because we have to reserve that a higher rate than we had under incurred number one and then because we do have to prefund day impact in just capital levels would be a little bit elevated especially in the back half of this year john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks very much and then second is you talk about strong growth in applications but the originations were generally flat is that an indication of being more selective in terms of what youre pulling through the funnel or is there any other commentary around that ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean john our strategy over the past several years has really been around quality driving riskadjusted returns and we do that by increasing application flows the more looks you get the higher a bar you can set in terms of what you book on your balance sheet and tying this to the competitive question we continue to increase our regions havent seen any sign of that slowing down and the more applications we bring in the more selective we can be around what we book and we dont see any signs of that slowing down here in the first quarter or expecting that to slow down here in jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and john id just say that ties into the initial question we got from ryan nash as well about giving us confidence around pricing power as well its all integrated together john hecht q analyst jefferies llc perfect thanks very much guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you operator thank you thats all the time we have now for questions jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc okay operator thank you that concludes todays
