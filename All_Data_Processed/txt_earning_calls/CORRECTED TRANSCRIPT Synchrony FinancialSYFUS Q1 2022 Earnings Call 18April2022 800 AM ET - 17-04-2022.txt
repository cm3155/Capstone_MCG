crossgenerational growth millennial and gen z spend increased yearoveryear and gen x and baby boomer spend increased the combination of strong purchase volume and a slight moderation in payment rate

our partners and customers and with that ill turn the call over to brian to discuss the first quarter financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys first quarter performance reflected continued strength across our diversified sales platforms and in particular the powerful combination of our digitally powered product suite seamless customer experiences and compelling value propositions which resonate deeply with the needs of our customers and partners we generated over billion of purchase volume in the first quarter of reflecting a increase compared to last year from a platform perspective our home auto diversified value digital and health wellness platforms each continue to experience doubledigit yearoveryear growth in purchase volume reflecting strong demand for both our products and attractive partner and provider networks at the platform level home auto purchase volume was higher due to the continued strength in home and improvement in auto as more consumers return to the road in diversified value purchase volume increased driven by strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement the yearoveryear increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform we experienced greater customer engagement including higher active accounts and higher spend per active among our more established programs and continue momentum in our new program launches the increase in health wellness purchase volume was driven by broadbased strength led by dental given the benefit of increases in patient volume compared to the prior year our lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of reflecting strong retailer sales and growth in music and specialty partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory shortages in power and particularly strong growth in the prioryear period loans grew yearoveryear to billion including loan receivables of billion and heldforsale receivables of billion at the platform level yearoveryear loan growth rates accelerated from the fourth quarter as strong purchase volume and some easing in payment rates contributed to balance growth synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 net interest income increased to million primarily reflecting a increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables on a sequential basis first quarter payment rate was down approximately basis points to but was still approximately basis points higher than last year and approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear historical average as we progress through the first quarter payment rate declined to in february but increased in march reflecting normal seasonality associated with the tax refund season that said march was the first month where payment rate was lower versus the prior year since the pandemic began in net interest margin was in the first quarter a yearoveryear increase of basis points the primary driver of this nim expansion was a increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interestearning assets due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity this accounted for basis points of the yearoveryear increase in our net interest margin in addition the first quarters 32basis point improvement in loan yield and 33basis point reduction in interestbearing liabilities cost each contributed basis points of nim improvement rsas were billion in the first quarter and of average receivables the million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs provision for credit losses was million an increase of versus last year due to lower reserve release that was partially offset by lower net chargeoffs in the first quarter included in this quarters provision was a reserve release of million inclusive of the reserve reduction from our heldforsale portfolios of million excluding the impact of our heldforsale portfolios the million reserve release reflected an improvement in our loss forecast and credit normalization trends based on continued strong performance partially offset by an uncertain macroeconomic environment other income decreased million primarily reflecting higher loyalty cost due to purchase volume growth the yearoveryear comparison was also adversely impacted by lower investment gains from our ventures portfolio other expenses increased to billion due to the impact of higher employee marketing and business development and technology costs other expense also included the impact of million related to certain employee and legal matters our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was compared to last year in total synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share during the first quarter we also generated a return on average assets of and return on tangible common equity of these strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model combined with the compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem not only were we able to support our strong customer demand with a diverse range of products but we were able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong riskadjusted returns next ill cover our key credit trends on slide elevated payment rates continue to drive yearoveryear improvement in our delinquency metrics our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and our 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year when removing the impact of the heldforsale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the quarters of this year and last year the 30plus delinquency metric wouldve been down about basis points versus and the 90plus metric would be down about basis points instead of our portfolios strong delinquency trends have continued to drive yearoveryear improvements in our net charge off rate which was compared to last year an 89basis point improvement yearoveryear primarily reflecting a very healthy consumer and a 45basis point higher payment rate the 36basis point sequential increase from our fourth quarter net chargeoff rate of primarily reflected the impact of approximately synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 basis point sequential decline in the payment rate as some consumers continue to revert back towards pre pandemic payment behaviors our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was up basis points from the in the fourth quarter lets focus on some key trends that have supported our strong performance and the confidence we have in our business first as we just discussed the underlying trends within our portfolio are performing better than our expectations heading into the year our portfolio payment trends continue to show gradual normalization across the credit spectrum reflecting the strength of the consumer more broadly in addition the population of customers within our portfolio that are now in postexpiration forbearance programs from other lenders has performed better than our expectations this suggests to us that with the benefit of excess savings due to stimulus modified spending behaviors and widespread forbearance these borrowers managed their personal balance sheet well through the pandemic and therefore have a lower probability of default according to data from indiscernible twothirds of consumers have either only spent a portion of their stimulus or have the entire amount of stimulus they received still saved the remaining third of consumers have spent the entirety of the cash stimulus they received during the last two years when tracking consumer balance trends by tiers to to and balances greater than the indiscernible data indicates that while all balance tiers of stimulusreceiving customers have seen balance declines between to from peak levels observed last fall the two higher tiers continue to show growth in their savings balances since the third stimulus check the lower tier with balances of or less has generally remained flat aside from the stimulus checks over the last two years meanwhile labor markets continue to be robust as unemployment levels declined and wage growth continues through midapril consumer spending continues to be strong reflecting broadbased spend across our platforms and products finally our portfolio is wellpositioned to navigate changing market conditions given its inherent diversification across spend categories financing options and channels and customer demographics synchronys sales platforms encompass a broad range of discretionary and nondiscretionary industry through a wide network of distribution channels more than a quarter of our purchase volume in came from each of our diversified value home auto and digital platforms another of purchase volume came from health wellness and almost half of our indiscernible spend in was comprised of bill pay discount store drug store healthcare grocery and nongrocery food and auto and gas spend in addition our disciplined approach to driving consistent growth and attractive riskadjusted returns means that our portfolio credit mix remains balanced and favorably positioned compared to the mix in the first quarter of at the end of the first quarter of approximately of our balances represented superprime customers another came from prime and the remaining came from nonprime and in terms of average credit line by credit segment our portfolios superprime prime and nonprime lines are still lower by an average of compared to two years ago moving on to another synchrony strength our funding capital and liquidity deposits at the end of the first quarter were billion an increase of million compared to last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by billion this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year with securitized funding comprising of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising at quarterend total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets down from last year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 as a reminder before i provide the details of our capital position it should be noted we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet this transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics to that end the first year phasein of the impact of cecl on our regulatory capital results in the reduction of our cet1 ratio of approximately basis points in the first quarter we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points below last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year we continue our track record of robust capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter we returned billion to shareholders through million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends even when factoring in the roughly basis points of remaining cecl transition impacts on our capital ratios over the next three years synchrony still has considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy in order to get to our cet1 target ratio this coupled with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business thanks to our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate riskadjusted returns means that synchrony is particularly wellpositioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance market conditions and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions as part of our capital plan the board has approved a increase in our common dividend bringing it to per share beginning the third quarter of in addition our board has approved an incremental share repurchase authorization of billion for the period ending june inclusive of the remaining million authorization we had in march this brings our total share repurchase authorization to billion finally lets turn to our updated outlook for the full year which is summarized on slide of our presentation we have assumed that the pandemic remains wellcontrolled that any rise in cases will not have a material impact on the economy or our customers our macroeconomic scenarios include a minimum of five interest rate increases during qualitative tightening measures starting in the second quarter a slowing economy resulting from these actions and continued higher inflationary conditions while the macroeconomic environment is uncertain given the dynamics of the portfolio as we see them today we do not anticipate a material impact on our full year outlook for loan receivables and credit performance we expect consumer demand to remain robust supporting broadbased purchase volume growth across the various industries and markets we serve as consumer savings begin to decline and payment rate moderates ph while on a lag we would expect purchase volume growth to moderate as the year progresses given the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth we have achieved we expect ending loan receivables growth of approximately versus the prior year to the extent that payment rate moderates further we would anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan growth to accelerate we expect our net interest margin to be between and for the full year as we move through the year nim will be impacted by the fluctuation in the percentage of average loan receivables to average earning assets due to the impacts of seasonal growth portfolio conveyances and the timing of funding as mentioned earlier our nim outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as rising interest and fees which will be partially offset by higher reversal as credit normalizes in terms of credit performance we expect a rise in delinquency and loss from current levels for the full year we expect net chargeoffs to be less than based on the performance weve seen across the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 portfolio we now expect the portfolio to reach our mean annual loss rate of until unless significant changes in the macroeconomic environment develop of course as credit normalization continues to take shape we expect interest and fee yields to increase as chargeoffs peak this growth in interest and fees will be partially offset by peak reversals we expect reserve builds in to be generally assetdriven rsa expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth but should begin to moderate as net chargeoffs rise for the full year we expect the rsa as a percentage of average loan receivables to be between and as a reminder we anticipate the gap and bp portfolio conveyances to occur in the second quarter producing a nonrecurring gain on sale of approximately million we expect to completely offset this gain through increased investments or incurring certain discrete items and thus be epsneutral for the full year included in this quarter was million of certain employee and legal matters leaving approximately million of the incremental costs remaining for the full year in terms of other expense we continue to expect the ph quarters levels to be approximately billion this outlook excludes the impact of the million gain on sale were reinvesting or incurring in our business we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage to the extent that receivables and revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year well moderate our spending where appropriate while still prioritizing the best longterm prospects for our business an example of such an opportunity might be through fewer workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spend so to conclude synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we progress through were confident in our businesss ability to deliver sustainable attractive riskadjusted growth even if the market conditions change our innovative customer experiences compelling value propositions and flexible product offerings are resonating across the diverse industries partners and customer demographics we serve our sophisticated cycletested underwriting as well as our deep domain experience of lending and servicing at scale mean that the predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities will continue to support the stability of synchronys target loss range finally our rsa functions as an economic buffer as interest and fees rise with credit normalization and receivables growth the rsa absorbs the impact of both rising net chargeoffs and a large proportion of any increases in growthoriented costs these factors enable synchrony to deliver consistent results with peerleading range of riskadjusted returns over time ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian we deeply understand the needs and expectations of our customers and partners which enables us to deliver financing solutions and experiences that strongly resonate building longlasting relationships and greater value over time synchronys differentiated business model consistently positions us as a partner of choice whether were powering financing experiences for local merchants healthcare providers or national brands were able to meet our customers where when and however they want to be met the scalability of our technology platform the breadth of our product suite and the depth of our lending insights across many industries enables us to consistently deliver sustainable and attractive outcomes for all of our stakeholders and with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 that concludes our prepared remarks well now begin the qa session in order to accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one question if you have additional questions please requeue and we will do our best to address as many questions as time allows otherwise the investor relations team will be available after the call for any followup operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and from credit suisse we have moshe orenbuch please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks brian wanted to kind of just followup on the net interest margin guidance obviously on a year overyear basis theres a big change in the mix of earning assets and you kind of alluded to the fact that that might be normalizing so is there a way to relate the 10ish percent growth in loans to growth in net interest income in dollars in other words how much of that expected decline from current levels on the margin is more about asset mix than it is about other factors thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks and good morning moshe yeah so i would expect and i think the way brian and i and the leadership team are managing the business is that we would like to see asset growth come through in nii right so the biggest wildcard then after would be the interest expense piece so we would expect that from a dollar basis it would track at least on the top line revenue and then again i highlighted a little bit of the timing relative to some of the funding cost changes that well have in place and youre right one of the bigger wildcards will be alr as a percent of average earning assets which was at a little bit higher mark than we usually run at during the first quarter it usually runs at a point or two lower than that but again it should track on a dollar basis at least on the revenue side back to asset growth operator thank you we have ryan nash please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning brian and good morning brian brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so brian the credit outlook both near and intermediate term seems more upbeat and i was wondering if you can maybe just talk about what youre seeing in the underlying portfolio that led to the better credit outlook and with the outlook from unemployment remaining pretty strong here just maybe outside of a recession can you just talk synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 about what you see as the drivers of normalization and are you seeing any impact from inflation on your customers spending habits thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thank you thanks ryan so first when you think about credit the biggest thing for us as we entered the year was the large portion in our book of customers who had received forbearance at other institutions and how those customers would play out off forbearance again we look back to the performance we had for folks that were on forbearance with us we obviously understood if you did not have forbearance with us and you look at this population of people as we looked over the last four months the performance of that was significantly better than our expectation so we watch that develop we also watch how our vintage post the refinements we made beginning of last year developed and we became more confident that we would not see what i would call a faster credit normalization which reflected in a slower glide back to our mean loss rate out in so thats really how credit developed again as we sit here in the first couple of weeks in april we havent seen anything that would most certainly change that view ill go to your last point about inflation and the customer the customer is really starting at a point of strength they absolutely have excess liquidity and we demonstrated that or at least indicated that with higher savings rates our credit delinquency and how it sits today average balances all are in great shape indiscernible and you have low employment so we look at the customer today when you look at purchase behavior pattern we see small evidences of inflation inside of our book but not really significant so if you looked at a category like gasoline our average transaction value on gasoline is up yearoveryear so you clearly see the effect of inflation there but in some respects we dont see other parts of inflation so look at grocery grocery for us average transaction value is flatoveryear flat sequentially every month during the quarter but frequency is up a little bit so that tells you the consumer is being able to manage their spend within inside of that category we see a little bit in apparel but the rest we have not seen any dramatic impacts from inflation as we move forward and to address your middle point on unemployment again we look at unemployment its obviously stronger than we had anticipated during the year it continues to remain strong theres more jobs that are outstanding i think most certainly with continued strength in the unemployment market we obviously believe that the credit forecast we put out both for this year and for next year will remain intact thanks ryan operator we have betsy graseck please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc could you unpack a little bit the loan growth acceleration that you got in digital and help us understand how much of that is coming from the new cards you have out there paypal verizon etcetera the new offerings the refreshed offerings on paypal and other drivers of that and contrast it with home auto which maybe decelerated a bit thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure betsy ill start on that id say look generally digital is a platform that we clearly expect to outpace the rest of the business in terms of growth rate were definitely seeing that a big chunk of that is obviously attributed to venmo and verizon both of those programs continue to perform really well still believe those will be top programs for us in the future were getting great both qualitative as well as quantitative feedback on both in terms of the experience the val prop etcetera theres really nothing inside the digital numbers this quarter for the paypal launch that just happened but were really excited about that as well i think thats going to be a terrific offering its really two parts first the val prop we think is bestinclass its going to be a topofwallet card for folks and then i would say the other thing that we did is we really launched probably our most sophisticated technology stack in terms of how were integrating inside of the paypal app so the experience is really fantastic so again i think digital will continue to outpace the rest of the business brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i think just to add on betsy for the home auto piece when you look at that platform auto is clearly improving it came off of a low last year so thats obviously a positive trend with regard to inside home theres a little bit of continued softness in the furniture portion of home which again is a little bit more of the inventory backlogs clearing out again we bill when furniture is delivered so we expect that to continue to be a headwind here for the next quarter or two hopefully as the inventory and supply chains clear up brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i think this is also the benefit of having a really diversified business were seeing really strong growth in digital really strong growth in health wellness and thats a little bit immune in terms of impact from supply chain and other things if you think about health wellness and the backlog that those providers are working through so again i think it speaks to the benefit of having a very diversified portfolio brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks betsy have a good day operator we have sanjay sakhrani please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc obviously the drum beat on macro weakness is increasing since we last spoke and i know brian wenzel you talked about all the statistics that make you comfortable on the state of the consumer im just thinking about the reserve posture you guys are pretty well above sort of where you were cecl day one maybe if you could just talk about how you accounted for the macro environment at the time cecl day one was set and then where we are today because at some point were going to migrate back down to cecl day one if losses remain well below those levels correct brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah and good morning sanjay so the way i would think about our reserve position today versus cecl adoption again our mean loss rate has not changed from that target so at the end of the day its really the loss forecast that gets you in that reasonable supportable period and then potentially any overlays so i think when you look at it today for us if you were solely to look at the macroeconomic conditions sanjay it would tell you that your coverage ratio will be down versus day one right one of the things that we still have is qualitative overlays both for some ph ofas relief that we talked about as well as we have some macroeconomic uncertainty as it relates to ukraine and a higher inflationary environment that kind of just keeping the reserves slightly higher than the day one again i think where we sit today is we will hopefully migrate back to that day one certainly as i think the inflationary pressures and the global geopolitical uncertainty clears and that reserve builds here in the coming months will really be more growthoriented so again absent mix we still view were going to migrate back to that day one cecl rate but again were trying to account for some of the uncertainties that exist in the marketplace thank you sanjay have a good day brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial brandon were ready for the next call brandon operator we have john hecht please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks guys very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey john synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc how are you guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc i guess one question any discussions with the partner pipeline or any major partnership renewals as we go through this year brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look i would say weve got a very strong pipeline across all five of the platforms if i look at it today it tends to skew a little bit more towards startup programs and opportunities like that as well as i would say distribution partnerships and opportunities as well for our products there isnt as much out there with the exception of maybe one or two that are large existing programs but well obviously get a look at those as well as they come up in the next year or two and then i think for us were actively renewing our programs we dont have anything significant of size coming up in the next few years but were always in discussions with our partners about what kind of changes can we make to drive even better performance and can we do that in the context of renewals so our teams are actively working those opportunities where they exist but generally i feel like weve got a pretty good pipeline and were wellpositioned were also getting a lot of good traction on the product suite and i think the benefits of having an integrated product suite so as were out there competing i think thats a real differentiator for us too brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john operator from wells fargo we have don fandetti please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc on the paypal cashback card refresh i guess my question is do you expect the same amount of ph revolve to drop or do you expect that to be a little more transactor and i guess brian doubles do you feel like the integration here is pretty deep does that make the relationship stickier in terms of sort of renewaltype risk longerterm synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so look id start by saying were really excited about the launch of the new value proposition and the new experiences out of the app i think its going to be a gamechanger paypal is excited about it so are we i would tell you that these opportunities that we have to relaunch the val prop it does drive a lot of traffic a lot of new accounts a lot of spend and i think with a val prop like this it will definitely be a topofwallet card we had a good val prop before but this is incremental so were really excited about it and i would tell you on your integration question don absolutely i think that our goal is for our integration to be absolutely seamless to the customer and we started doing this years ago with sypi now were leveraging our api stacks and i can tell you when youre inside the paypal app the venmo app you dont know what was something that was developed by paypal or something that was developed by synchrony its just completely seamless you never know you never have to step outside of the app you never get kicked to a website its integrated and completely seamless so thats our goal we dont necessarily focus on how does that impact the renewal down the road were really focused on just how do we deliver the absolute best experience we can for a paypal customer a venmo customer etcetera so were very excited to have this launched and look forward to seeing how it does brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don have a good day operator from bank of america we have mihir bhatia please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning brian i guess both brians and kathryn and thank you for taking my questions wanted to just go back to payment rates for a second we saw a pretty big moderation in march maybe you can just talk a little bit about that i guess what made the payment rates go from up basis points yearoveryear to down basis points the reason i just asked about march is thats when we started seeing a lot more conversation around inflation higher gas prices starting to have an impact so was that a consumer thing was that as you expected is there something else about the yearoveryear comp we should be keeping in mind anything there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah first of all thank you mihir for the question so again theres a little bit of timing related to tax refunds that plays out so clearly there was some faster refunds that were paid out in february versus march if you look at the overall tax refund season right your average refund is ahead of last year i want to say and the dollars are probably ph million ahead so we think that had probably a little bit of disproportional effect in february we also think as we watch consumer behavior patterns weve indicated to you we have seen portions of the portfolios in cohorts that have decelerated pay rates beginning in the latter part of and that has continued into when we look at it i know we get a lot of questions with regard to credit grades inside of that are you seeing it in any one particular place inside the portfolio if i look at march alone so just march alone the deceleration in the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 payment rate happened across all credit grades so its not at the lower end and actually the largest percentage of deceleration happened in the prime segment so its not a subprime issue relative to inflation and i think when you also look at the again we also talk quite a bit about people who pay their statement balances their minimum payments were in the middle weve obviously seen the folks in the middle decline but go equally up into full pays and down into minimum pays so again it really says this is across the board and we dont necessarily think its inflationdriven but part of i think the migration that we anticipated back on payment rate back to the mean that we anticipate the exact timing of which were not sure of but again were starting to see that turn so thank you mihir operator from jpmorgan we have rick shane please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning when we look at the operating expenses and talk about the incremental reinvestments in im curious should we see that as a run rate or should we see the million that you have remaining through the rest of the year as sort of onetime or incremental as we think about numbers going forward brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great great thanks for the question it will be onetime expenses we had the million in the first quarter that related to some employeerelated reductions i think as you step into the second quarter again well detail this out youll see some further reductions in some of our physical footprint and structural cost inside the business youll see some incremental dollars that are put into marketing to really accelerate growth and that will be one time in nature so i would not anticipate it to be an ongoing expense again what were trying to do is take the onetime gain really reinvest it back into the business either to reduce structural costs or accelerate growth so it should be a netzero for this year and not comp into next year but hopefully help the growth thank you operator from piper sandler we have kevin barker please go ahead kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking my questions and good morning i would like to go back to your comments about nim and the expectations for deposit costs deposit costs are higher in the previous rate cycle versus today but your balance sheet is much more deposit fundamentally than it was previously so it seems like structurally you should have a slightly better liability structure in this rate cycle i was hoping maybe you can just dig a little bit deeper on your expectations for deposit betas in this cycle versus the previous cycle and your expectations for overall funding costs just given the uncertainty around rates and inflation brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great question so when we look back to the kind of previous cycle on previous rate increases again we were really growing our deposit book which we started back in call it the early to range so were accelerating growth in the bank and given the fact that we were a newly separated company there was some higher costs that were embedded in there i think you are right we have shifted from probably a mid percent deposit composition of the funding stack to at least low now mid potentially i think were this synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 quarter so that is going to provide a benefit theres going to be some rotation i think as you see interest rates rise here a lot of folks have gone into savings versus cds in the short run that could have some negative impact over the long run getting people locked into cds in this environment is a better alternative for us so we look at that as being over the longterm a good thing if i can get people into termrelated savings products i think when you think about betas if you look where we are so far today with the first 25basis point movement less than half of that if you call it that has already manifested itself in our highyield savings rates depending upon the tenor essentially its been but weve really been trying to raise deposits because our growth rate of being targeted at that approximately we want to get ahead of some of the fundingrelated matters so its going to be a little bit around what competition does in the marketplace but again it could be slightly higher than previous cycles but again people have been slower to react so far into the environment and again i think the higher deposit mix will be very beneficial for us as we think about nim moving forward thank you operator we have indiscernible please go ahead q hi thanks for taking my question so i guess on slide you guys mentioned the annual loss rate wont hit the mean until unless significant macro changes can you sort of just quantify what comprises some of these changes i just sort of want to get a sense on how youre thinking about downside scenarios thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah when you think about our loss rate the biggest variable that drives loss in a recession or any other environment is unemployment and whats going to be different i think as people think about the macroeconomic backdrop is that youre coming from incredibly low unemployment and you really have builtup savings in the prime and superprime segment so when you traditionally think about a credit normalization or an increase in your loss expectation its driven off of unemployment number one and then two in the prime segment it really goes into people that struggle that have higher exposure at default so i think as we look at it going forward because you have such low unemployment you have more jobs than you have today up until now albeit not necessarily offsetting inflation a rising hourly wage that buffers some of the unemployment pressure that you would see in the loss rate and the excess savings that you have would buffer some of the lost content that youd see in the prime segment thats what gives us probably greater comfort that theres more of a glide even in this slightly difficult scenario the scenario where macroeconomics changes is you do have a rapid rise in unemployment and you have a very fast depletion in savings rates in the prime customers could dictate a higher loss rate over that horizon thank you indiscernible operator we have indiscernible please go ahead q good morning on the payment rate expectation i know you flagged the decline that you saw in march which is encouraging can you maybe talk about your confidence in sustainable decline there on the payment rate front and then on the flipside i appreciate the color you gave on the delinquencies and at least some of the progression on credit by customer segmentation are you seeing any stress at all in the lower income bands thats synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 noteworthy here because were hearing about some payment issues at the lower income at other payment providers out there thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah let me deal with your latter question with regard to the lower credit were not seeing as you refer to it pressure we see normalization thats happened on payment rate as on entry rate and delinquency flows but not pressure so i know there are other some subprime issuers out there that have pressure they have been more aggressive really going out during the id call it the middle part of the pandemic to open the origination or credit box for them we obviously didnt do that so were not seeing incremental pressure were seeing more what i would say normalization back to a prepandemic level related to that lower credit quality with regard to payment rate and this is something we monitor closely we monitor in lots of different ways credit grade is one we look at different aspects inside of it we look at whos paying call it statement balances min pays between that again were following a trend it appears to be moving in the right direction the exact slope here we have to get through the tax return season here which will be april and then well begin to see how the consumer continues to react again theyre spending very healthily across the industry right relative to credit cards so purchase volume trends will most certainly help bring the payment rate back in line with mean averages so theres nothing that we see thats stressed theres nothing that we see that theres indicative of a change in direction relative to the slope of the performance thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial next question brandon operator we have arren cyganovich please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks the loan growth guide is a bit above your kind of longterm expectation can you just talk a little bit about is that more payment rate is it more kind of acceleration in terms of the customer activity or is it still bit of a catch up from some of the pandemicrelated maybe on the healthcare side brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look i would say maybe just to take a step back id say generally we feel pretty good about the operating environment as we look at it here for the balance of the year we were talking about high single digits earlier this year i think we feel better that thats going to be in that kind of 10plus range were not relying on an enormous amount of payment rate moderation in that it really is more top line purchase volumedriven we just had our highest first quarter ever in terms of sales on our products so were seeing really good growth across the portfolio we had growth rates on receivables in the five platforms anywhere from to so its broad based its not one platform thats really driving that it really is across the business so we feel like at least for the balance of the year the consumer is strong as brian said twothirds of them saved at least a portion of if not all of the stimulus so were seeing that come through in purchase volume were seeing it in the credit metrics so like i said we feel pretty good about the environment right now and it really is driving what were seeing on the growth side and its not necessarily a reversion to the mean on payment rate synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator we have time for one final question once again we have time for one final question from autonomous research we have brian foran please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hi thanks i guess as you think about the outlook for the consumer and how you feed that through managing the business its tricky right because youve been very clear everything youre seeing recently is better than budgeted consumers in great shape one of the narratives in the market is the fed has got to jack rates to plus its got to get unemployment up to tame inflation and its kind of like all going to play out over the next six months or so but we really wont know the impact until next year and so i guess the spirit of the question is like as you think through your underwriting and your marketing this year i know youre always making changes and always trying to be thoughtful and proactive is there any scenario where like youre tightening underwriting even though your book is doing great because of that forward fed risk or how do you think about meeting that unusual interest rate risk through the book and through your marketing plans as we move through the year brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look generally i would say brian were going through a period of extraordinarily strong performance as it pertains to credit i mean weve never seen delinquencies and loss rates where they are we dont underwrite to these levels theyre about half of what we would consider a target nco rate and so what i would tell you were not tightening in expectation of whats going to happen in and because we didnt think take opportunity to go a lot deeper right were not underwriting to todays environment whether its how were underwriting the consumer how were underwriting new programs were looking at this as kind of an over time mean loss rate and thats what were underwriting to so one of the things that weve talked about in the past its really important in our businesses when times are extraordinarily good we dont necessarily go a lot deeper we try and maintain our discipline and we look at the value of whether its a customer or a program agreement we look at that over a number of years and assume that over that time period youre going to have some reversion to the mean and thats really the discipline that we have around our underwriting model again whether youre looking at consumers or new programs and how were pricing those we try and factor in what we think is going to happen over the next few years and not take advantage of the extraordinarily good period that were operating in right now brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator this concludes the qa you may now disconnect synchrony
