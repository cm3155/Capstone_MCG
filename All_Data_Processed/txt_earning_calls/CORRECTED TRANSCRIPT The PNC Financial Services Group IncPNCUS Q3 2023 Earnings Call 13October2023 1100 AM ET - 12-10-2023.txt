bryan and good morning everyone as you can see on the slide we delivered strong results in the third quarter generating billion in net income or in diluted earnings per share rob is going to take you through the numbers in a moment but id like to touch on a few highlights the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 first in the challenging operating environment we generated points of positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management our credit quality remained strong during the quarter reflecting our thoughtful approach to managing risk customer selection and longterm relationship development all of which have historically served us well in challenging economic cycles next we strengthened our capital and liquidity positions even further during the quarter while we continue to monitor discussions regarding regulatory changes in these areas based on our current estimates we are well positioned to meet the proposed requirements without meaningful changes to how we operate we continue to execute on our key strategic priorities including our expansion market efforts and upgrading our digital capabilities and we leveraged our strong balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities such as the signature bank loans that we recently acquired finally we are focused on expense management particularly in the current environment and have taken actions to maintain disciplined expense control we increased our continuous improvement goal last quarter from million to million and we are on track to achieve that goal in looking ahead we expect to have cip savings within a similar range for and as a reminder we use savings from this program to fund investments in key growth markets and technology in addition earlier this month we began executing on staff reductions which will reduce our expenses by million and will fall to the bottom line all told we are implementing more than million of expense management actions that will have impact on while decisions involving personnel are never easy we believe they will help us more effectively and efficiently deliver for our customers and our stakeholders and well continue to be diligent in our expense management going forward and with that ill turn it over to rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis and comparing to the second quarter loans were down and averaged billion investment securities declined billion or cash balances at the federal reserve increased billion to billion deposits of billion declined billion or borrowed funds increased billion primarily due to senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter at quarter end aoci was a negative billion compared to a negative billion at june reflecting higher interest rates however tangible book value increased to per common share as retained earnings growth exceeded the negative impact of aoci common dividends in the quarter totaled approximately million and we remain wellcapitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of as of september which increased basis points linked quarter slide shows our loans in more detail third quarter loans averaged billion and increased billion or compared to the same period a year ago reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 compared to the second quarter average loan balances declined as growth in consumer was more than offset by a decline in commercial consumer loans grew approximately million reflecting higher residential mortgage and credit card balances commercial loans averaged billion a decline of billion driven by lower utilization as well as pay downs outpacing new production loan yields increased basis points to in the third quarter predominantly driven by the higher rate environment slide covers our deposits in more detail average deposits decreased billion or due to a decline in consumer deposits that was somewhat offset by a growth in commercial deposits in regard to mix consolidated noninterestbearing deposits were in the third quarter down slightly from in the second quarter and consistent with our expectations and we still expect the noninterestbearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid20 range commercial noninterestbearing deposits represented of total commercial deposits in the third quarter compared to in the second quarter and our consumer deposit noninterestbearing mix remains stable at our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to during the third quarter up from in the prior quarter and as of september our cumulative deposit beta was which was slightly better than our july expectation slide details our investment security and swap portfolios average investment securities of billion decreased billion or as curtailed purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities the securities portfolio yield increased basis points to reflecting new purchase yields of and the runoff of lower yielding securities as of september the duration of investment securities portfolio was years our received fixed swaps pointed to the commercial loan book totaled billion on september the weighted average received fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased basis points to and the duration of the portfolio was years as of september accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately million in the third quarter as the negative impact of higher rates more than offset paydowns and maturities during the quarter importantly as lower rate securities and swaps roll off we expect our securities yield to continue to increase resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from aoci accretion turning to the income statement on slide for the first nine months of revenue grew compared to the same period a year ago reflecting higher interest rates and business growth noninterest expense grew and was wellcontrolled despite a higher fdic assessment rate and inflationary pressures as a result we generated positive operating leverage and ppnr grew for the third quarter net income was billion or per share total revenue of billion decreased million or compared to the second quarter of net interest income declined million or and our net interest margin was a decline of basis points noninterest income increased million or as higher fee income was partially offset by lower other noninterest income third quarter expenses decreased million or linked quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 provision was million in the third quarter and our effective tax rate was which included a favorable impact of certain tax matters in the third quarter for the full year we now expect our tax rate to be approximately turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends third quarter revenue was down million or compared with the second quarter net interest income of billion decreased million or as higher yields on interestearning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs fee income was billion an increase of million or linked quarter the primary driver of the increase in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue which was up million the majority of which were million was related to an increase in the valuation of net mortgage servicing rights partially offsetting this capital markets and advisory revenue decreased million or driven by lower trading revenue ma advisory activity continued to remain softer in the third quarter despite robust pipelines going forward we do expect this activity to increase in the fourth quarter which is included in our guidance that i will cover in a few minutes other noninterest income of million declined million linked quarter driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative visa fair value adjustments totaling million as a reminder at september pnc owned million visa class b shares with an unrecognized gain of approximately billion turning to slide our third quarter expenses were down million or linked quarter which in part reflected our increased cip program and we generated positive operating leverage on both a yeartodate and linked quarter basis importantly every expense category remained stable or declined compared to the second quarter of our credit metrics are presented on slide while overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio the pressures we anticipated within the commercial real estate office sector have begun to materialize nonperforming loans increased million or linked quarter the increase was driven by multitenant office cre which increased million but was partially offset by a decline of million in noncre npls in regard to the cre office portfolio total criticized loans remained essentially flat quarteroverquarter at the difference this quarter is the migration of certain multitenant office loans to npl status which is an expected outcome as we work to resolve the occupancy and rate challenges inherent to this portfolio ultimately we expect future losses on this portfolio and we believe we have reserved against those potential losses accordingly as of september our reserves on the office portfolio were of total office loans and inside of that on the multitenant portfolio naturally well continue to monitor and review our assumptions especially in the higher rate environment to ensure they reflect the realtime market conditions and a full update of the portfolio is included in the appendix slides total delinquencies of billion increased million or linked quarter driven by higher consumer loan delinquencies net loan chargeoffs of million declined million or linked quarter our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans ratio was basis points in the third quarter and our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on september essentially stable with june turning to slide from a capital perspective were wellpositioned with a cet1 ratio of as of september this slide illustrates the impact to our capital levels assuming the basel iii endgame proposed rules were effective as of september the inclusion of aoci reduces our ratio by approximately basis points and the the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 impact of all other proposed basel iii endgame components are estimated to have an additional negative to 50basispoint impact to our cet1 taken together the current basel iii endgame proposal would increase our riskweighted assets by approximately to and our estimated fully phasedin expanded riskbased cet1 ratio would be approximately which is above our current requirement of in light of the fluidity of the capital proposals our share repurchase activity remains on pause well continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchases activity depending on market and economic conditions as well as other factors in regard to the longterm debt proposal that the rule was effective at the end of the third quarter our binding constraint would be the longterm debt to riskweighted assets ratio at both the holding company and the bank level we estimate our current shortfall at the holding company ph and the bank to be approximately billion and billion respectively and we expect to reach compliance at both the consolidated and bank level through our current funding plan as well as the restructuring of existing intercompany debt we acknowledge and want to emphasize that proposals are still in their comment period and the final rules are subject to change that being said were wellpositioned to comply with the proposals as drafted slide provides more detail on the billion portfolio of capital commitment facilities we acquired from signature bridge bank earlier this month pnc has been active in the capital commitment business for many years we believe the acquisition will enhance our broader efforts in the private equity sponsor industry signatures origination strategy was similar to pncs which is focused on building relationships with large and established fund managers as such we expect to retain of the portfolio this acquisition is financially attractive given the purchase price of of par and the high credit quality of the portfolio importantly the transaction does not have a material impact to our capital ratios or tangible book value per share slide details our focus on controlling expenses as bill mentioned we remain diligent in our expense management efforts particularly when considering the current revenue environment our continuous improvement program has been in place for over a decade and through this program weve utilized expense savings to fund our ongoing business growth and technology investments over the past years through cip weve identified and completed actions to reinvest billion in our company as you know we have a cip target of million and were on track to meet that target looking to even though weve just begun our budgeting process we do expect the annual cip goal of similar magnitude to the program our cip efforts over the years have allowed us to substantially invest in our company while still delivering low singledigit annual expense growth however the current environment poses meaningful pressures necessitating expense control measures beyond our annual cip program as a result we took a hard look at our organizational structure and identified opportunities to operate more efficiently through staff reduction which we began implementing earlier this month this initiative will decrease the workforce by and is expected to reduce expenses by approximately million onetime costs associated with this plan are expected to be approximately million and will be incurred during the fourth quarter of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 we believe these actions will position pnc for stronger efficiency going forward as a result even though our budgeting cycle isnt complete we have an objective to keep core expenses stable in which by definition would exclude the fourth quarter onetime charges in summary pnc reported a solid third quarter in regard to our view of the overall economy were expecting a mild recession starting in the first half of with a contraction in real gdp of less than we expect the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term between and through mid2024 when we expect the fed to begin cutting rates looking ahead our outlook for the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of is as follows we expect the average loans to be up approximately including the acquisition of the signature bank capital commitment facilities net interest income to be down to fee income to be up approximately as increased capital markets activity is expected to more than offset the impact of the elevated msr hedge gains during the third quarter other noninterest income to be in the range of million and million excluding net securities and visa activity we expect total core noninterest expense to be up to which excludes charges related to the workforce reduction additionally this guidance does not contemplate the pending fdic special assessment which could occur during the fourth quarter and we expect fourth quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the just regarding the office increase in nonperformers that you discussed a bit could you just give us a little bit more detail is that more indicative of did you see an acceleration in the deterioration of these credits that were noteworthy in the quarter and that necessitated to move to nonaccrual or was this more of a function of a ongoing scrub of your portfolio as youre reevaluating collateral values or whatnot behind properties and as you do that as well can you maybe talk about some of the value depreciation youre beginning to see on some properties that have traded thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i guess what i would say is what youre seeing is kind of our expected cycle through deteriorating credit so our criticized list didnt really move we moved inside of that loans to nonperforming by the way i think theyre actually all still accruing we just kind of get there because we dont think theyre refinanceable in the current market the move to nonperforming from already being criticized comes about as you just watch cap rates creeping higher and adjust the underlying value of the properties accordingly so i dont i mean none of this is a surprise we have heavy reserves against it we kind of saw it coming its the big bulk of these properties moving through the indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and its just the migration of the past william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc we do expect losses as ive said in my comments but we believe that were appropriately reserved indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and theres no theres its not like theres some new scrubbing john i mean weve been were live on every one of these properties every day so its not like we opened a drawer and found something we know exactly what each of these are audio gap john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks bill and then separately on the expense side could you maybe help us think about how the million you expect to fall to the bottom line from the head count rationalization how that would impact the growth rate that you expect overall for expenses in versus how should we think about that growth the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so i mentioned in my opening comments when we walk down both the cip that we anticipate implementing in along with this workforce reduction that our objective is to keep expenses stable yearoveryear we havent completed our budget process in fact were at the beginning of our budget process so we dont have a lot of guidance for you other than that is our objective and that will be our expectation william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and john the other thing the reason we kind of put the continuous improvement in there is its a number that we typically reinvest into our growth businesses in the future of the company so thats sort of whats been driving our investment gain for the last bunch of years and that continues whats new is basically dropping the run rate related to personnel and just tightening the ship in what is a tougher revenue environment john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it got it im sorry if i could ask just one more on the signature acquisition of the signature loans that is the of accretion that you mentioned on that can you maybe just walk us through the components of that how you arrive with that amount robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc oh sure thats basically the yield in terms of the portfolio that we purchased we they are shortterm about a year so we do expect that a share that we talked about in the fourth quarter and then going into but when we get to of course well include that in our full year guidance john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys this is nate stein on behalf of matt oconnor just one quick followup on the expense program you talked about the million total cost actions so outside of the workplace reduction can you just talk about the just the other areas of efficiencies youre investing in thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean the workforce reduction is a specific number we mentioned of the million inside of continuous improvement which we do every year were focused on contract renewals on ph manage with the buyers building robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the segments william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc occupancy efficiencies all the things youd expect us to be focused on in the ordinary course of running the business robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and thats a program that weve had in place as i mentioned for several years and allows us to and has allowed us to grow annual expenses in the low singledigit range even with all those investments and in point of fact this year were pointing to growth yearoveryear or over and a large part of that is because of our continuous improvement program nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks and then if i could just ask you a followup question on the capital market fees so they came in weaker than expected this quarter you talked about i think stable versus the last quarter one of your larger peers reported stronger capital markets this morning can you just talk about the driver of this was it mostly mix related and then maybe touch on the outlook in the near term given the macro outlook is better than a few months ago thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i didnt im not sure what anybody else reported my guess was that the trading line item was better than peer fees but in our case the bulk of our capital markets income come from various advisory fees from harris williams or solebury or syndications and so forth and while the pipelines remain robust if not at record levels the activity level while theres been some green shoots just hasnt been strong eventually it flows through but were getting a little tired of predicting when it will be robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc but yeah i would add to that our capital markets is weighted towards our ma advisory harris williams we had a soft second quarter at the end of the second quarter our pipelines were higher than the first quarter so we thought naturally that the third quarter would be higher but it wasnt so we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter with even higher pipeline than we had at the beginning of the quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 but inside of that subset of the pipeline are signed deals which that part is higher than it was at this point last quarter so we do expect to see the lift and our expectations are that we get back to first quarter levels nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everyone thanks for taking the call robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i wanted to ask sort of a broad question hey kind of a broad question on nii are we getting to a point where thatll start to trough so maybe rob just sort of some of the puts and takes it seems like your deposit betas are coming in as expected or better i know there should be some asset repricing as we look into next year but some of the larger banks have been sort of vocal about the degree to which theyre still overearning on nii which i think has kind of kept these fears of still bleeding out nii alive sort of industrywide maybe just some thoughts on how you see things playing out for pnc in particular william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc ill start robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc okay go ahead william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc all of it ends up being dependent on what you think the fed is going to do personally i think the fed is higher for longer even higher for longer than the market expects on our official forecast i guess we have two cuts towards the back at next year as short rates stay higher you will continue to see betas creep up both because were going to reprice the back book and secondly because youll just not on betas but just on the shift from non interestbearing to interestbearing so when that inflection point is has in some ways to do the most with whats going on with the yield curve and the fed as the curve continues to flatten by the long end selling off all else equal that helps notwithstanding the marks on our existing bonds it helps with the price we get on the roll down and reinvestment so theres too the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 many variables in there but the basic notion that were at the inflection point i think is entirely dependent on what happens with the fed in the coming year and we havent done our budget yet so were not going to call it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i would just add to that just observations deposits continue to decline we expected that but that decline is slowing betas have gone up but the increase has slowed in fact in the third quarter they came actuals came in lower than what we expected for the first time since rates have been increasing rapidly so things have slowed as far as that trajectory is and then obviously the inflection point issues that bill just covered are valid r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you then maybe a question on credit as well i guess there just in the last few weeks thereve been a couple commercial hiccups in the industry in the shared national credit space just well something you might be able to remind us about pncs exposure in this next phase and then just generalization sort of how that portfolio quality compares to the rest of the book how much you lead et cetera robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah pretty good there pretty good there scott in terms of credit so all of the noise so to speak is in the commercial real estate office space that we spoke about as far as the shared national credit results went theyre complete theyre represented in our numbers and it was pretty benign in terms of total deals upgrades were more than downgrades but they were a handful of each r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thank you very much robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ph partially offset by separation costs in fact you guys gave us good color on the burnoff of the securities portfolio and question i had is it looked like this quarter you put more up at the fed so what are you guys doing with the cash flows from the portfolio now in terms of where youre putting it and other securities and then second once the basel iii endgame is finalized how do you think you guys will approach in carrying your securities will you carry less on available for sale or more can you share with us your thoughts there as well william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 just with the existing book its running down weve run down the dv01 in our securities and swaps through the course of the entire year weve had some purchases but not to the extent weve had maturities and weve been buying i dont know what average yield is but stuff that roughly carries flat versus leaving it at the fed going forward the switch from available for sale to held to maturity doesnt really affect anything its an accounting entry so well keep some amount in available for sale to the extent we trade around that book but we dont trade around that book all that much and the rest will just buy in down the maturity which is by the way what weve been doing thus far since rates have gone up robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah but theres a couple things to add there one of the uses of cash gerard was the purchase of the signature loans so that was our biggest outlay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah that was indiscernible yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah that was our biggest outlay and then on the split bill had it right where we are now is probably about where we are plus or minus to your views in terms of what but the where we got to holding it all to of afs was the tailoring which has passed us so were back to sort of the normal split gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you just mentioned about the purchase of the signature loans you guys are in a good position that youre not being impacted by basel iii endgame rwa inflation like some of the big money centers of course do you think theres going to be opportunities for you guys to buy other portfolios not from the fdic per se but from some of your peers or banks that do mitigation strategies to get to these rwa targets they need to get to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i suppose there could be i dont know that weve actually seen any we get pitched by everybody to execute one which we have no need for robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but the purchase side of that is actually pretty attractive theyre giving away a lot of economics so its actually a good thought ill go look around the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc no we have the capital flexibility to do it and people know our telephone number gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah and then specifically it would be more in the ci space or consumer do you guys have a preference should they call that phone number rob william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its look were intelligent hopefully intelligent takers of risk at the right price gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we can evaluate whats out there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good all right thank you gentlemen william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc next question please operator operator instructions our next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning bill and rob wanted to followup on your office cre comments how much of an impact to debt service coverage are pnc customers experiencing from swaps that are rolling off say in cases where they issued floating rate debt underserved two to three years ago and put on swaps to lock in low fixed rates at the time but are now facing a significant reset as those swaps mature im just curious just how significant that maturing swap dynamic is inside of the portfolio and whether you feel like you have a good handle on that dynamic william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont know the answer to that i would tell you though the bulk of our stuff and you see it in our maturity schedules were kind of stabilization loansish project loans and so in that instance the hedge dynamics of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 somebody would put on that loan in my experience would be less than what they would have done on a term 10year cmbs alternative so my guess is its not i think theyre just in trouble for floating rate loans from lease rates going down from vacancies going up and from the rehab costs of redoing floors robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc capital improvement william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc just dropping the value of the buildings bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats helpful thank you and if i could follow up on that if refinancing loans at current market rates would cause debt service coverage ratios to fall below can you discuss how much leeway there is inside of pnc to refinance loans under potentially more favorable terms to allow debt service coverage ratios to remain satisfactory and then maybe just more broadly across the industry do you think socalled extend and pretend dynamics could become pervasive particularly since banks have made it clear they dont want to own office buildings and weve seen some commentary from regulators sort of urging banks to work with their customers william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well i think the extend part is possible i think the pretend part robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc not so good william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc that doesnt work the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc not so good william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we work with borrowers to figure out how to maximize the value of the property because thats ultimately going to maximize value of our loan in some instances that means taking the building and selling it in some instances that means getting more equity capital extending a loan at the service coverage ratio we normally wouldnt under the theory that they can lease it up themselves but each and every one of those decisions is a decision tree based on whats the net present value of what we pnc can get against our loan in any event if we do something that is uneconomic relative to the original loan that shows up and our reserves or chargeoffs or so on and so forth theres no pretend involved bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats very helpful bill thank you and if i could squeeze in one last one on the point about whether were at an inflection point on deposit betas sort of depending on the fed theres a ph correlate to that suggest that we could see terminal beta expectations potentially drift higher relative to prior guidance again depending on how much higher for longer persists william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think and by the way this isnt a forecast i think its just common sense right to the extent that we still have a back book of business as does everybody that hasnt necessarily repriced and if rates are pinned at forever in time that beta will continue to go up its a function of how high does the fed go and how long do they stay there and everybody has been wrong so far so yeah its a possibility bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood i wanted to ask you another one about the cfpb sort of open banking proposal bill but ill queue back up for that one thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 operator our next question is from the line of peter troisi with barclays please go ahead peter troisi q analyst barclays capital inc hi thanks very much for the disclosure on the longterm debt shortfalls in the slides you talked about billion of debt issuance annually but do you anticipate needing to issue more than billion to close the shortfalls that you disclosed in the slides or can the billion shortfall at the bank be met just by restructuring existing internal debt and i guess the question really is do you expect to issue debt at the holding company specifically to invest in the internal debt of the bank robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah this is rob so a good question so in regard to the longterm debt our message is independent of the rules as we resume a more conventional funding structure in terms of our debt to our deposits that was pre covid we would be compliant so thats the takeaway in regard to how we get there its a combination of everything that you outlined there will be issuances at the holding company as part of our ongoing plan that will then ultimately be ph tapered down to the bank but theres a lot of moving parts there the message is well get there and we would have gotten there independent of these rules peter troisi q analyst barclays capital inc okay thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is a followup question from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah thanks for taking my followup so bill i was hoping you could just share your thoughts on the cfpbs plans to propose an open banking rule theres a view that open banking essentially forces the industry to hand over the keys to the customer relationship youve talked in the past about sort of the dynamic of like passwords and all that kind of stuff but i was just hoping you could speak broadly to that point or that topic william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think what ive seen thus far out of cfpb commentary is theyre largely focused on some of the right things make it easier for customers agree with that secure data agree with that dont allow data to be sold and commercialized without customer permission agree with that make customers agree to specific data items that they want to share in a secure environment so all of that stuff versus where we are today where its a freeforall and theres a lot of fraud actually im in favor of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 the notion of kind of open banking where somehow i can just lift and shift my account from one bank to another because now theres technology to do it im not that afraid of that its more in the technology to allow it in a secure manner dependent of what rule is written doesnt exist today and i kind of look at what theyre doing and hope its a step in the right direction on security and the safety and soundness of customer information leading to a reduction in fraud across the industry and i the sound bites are thats where theyre going bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats helpful i had heard something along the lines of some of the actions theyre taking are intended to make it easier for customers to break up with their banks and so i was wondering if there was anything in the language you mentioned how youre not worried about the ability to shift the relationship so william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look at the end of the day by the way if that happened terrific we compete every day and we have good customer service and great products well be a net beneficiary practically the technology to allow that to happen so just think about the notion of okay now you have connected apis that allow somebody to gather information and move information now you need to build a program that keeps tracking the back book while you open a new book on a checking account transfers balances on cards so eventually somebody will come up with a cool business model that might be able to do that on the back of ph laws that allow it on the back of apis that havent been written yet on the back of technology that links all the banks in question together but that hasnt happened yet bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats great very helpful thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator our next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc sorry about that earlier so in terms of the decline in commercial loans how much of that decline is due to softer demand and how much of that is deliberate as you look to shore up capital more than you previously would have intended william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 well none of its deliberate per se weve seen some drop in utilization weve seen a drop in kind of refinance rate as people are if you think about a corporate loan revolver where its a threeyear and every two years you renew it for the next three years everybody is kind of extending that under the hope that things are going to get better on spreads so theres just been less activity at the margin we are extending less credit into creditonly new relationships on the hope that were going to get fees versus protecting our wallet where we already have a lot of fees and get crosssell but thats kind of a robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thats small william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc at the margin robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats small william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thing robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc its on the demand side william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and youre very clear about the expense guidance and the tough actions youre taking with personnel did you give an outlook for operating leverage over next year do you think the pace of expense decline will be faster than any decline in revenues and specifically to the fourth quarter the sbny loan acquisition looks like it adds a couple percent to your fourth quarter nii but youre guiding down to so that decline might be a little bit more than some had expected its more than you had expected the quarter decline looks like to in the fourth quarter is that math correct why is it down maybe more than you thought and the big question though is revenues versus expenses over the next year robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 mike do you want me to mike okay on the expense issue we did say that we expect expenses to be stable and we havent finished our budgeting cycle so we cant really answer in terms of anything beyond that in in regard to the nii in the fourth quarter guide it does include the signature acquisition which we said was about a share recall in the third quarter we had expected to decline we ended up down so when we look to the fourth quarter roll all that together thats how we get down to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it okay thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc okay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys one followup on the signature acquisition as well so just wondering if you can provide a little more context on the portfolio seeing the line that youre expecting to hold on to or expecting to hold on to of the relationships over time are you bringing on new team members is there expenses along with that and just anything you can help us in terms of like the duration of the loans and is there just kind of a natural runoff that happens given i think that theyre generally a pretty short duration type of loan thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah its de minimis adds of people that were bringing on were already in the business we have the technology to be in the business we know the clients the rundown were kind of saying at probably survives most of that is simply a function of where we have overlapped with clients and the size hold that wed want to have for a particular client wed syndicate more of it as we kind of rightsize our hold there may be inside of that book of business a handful of people that we would choose not to renew but their credit quality is pristine we underwrote every fund that is in that and through time you would expect that as they mature well renew in some period of time out a couple years well end up with of the notional that we started with then youll have no clue between now and then how much it was yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc but thats right de minimis expenses involved with it and were excited about it the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats a fair point on we wont know thats what i was trying to ask the william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but its were not going to ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the second question bill william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were not but to be clear its ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean it will be lost inside of our book of business ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it becomes part of our ci balances the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 13oct2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc completely understood the second question i had bill is you mentioned in a higher ph longterm environment we got to see what the fed does in terms of where deposit betas and mix goes on the asset side however though can you help us understand what happens in terms of fixed rate loan repricing versus and how much you might still have left in that versus obviously when we get to a peak and fed funds will know that the variable rates will have gotten there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so we have i mean beyond our securities book and swaps which obviously we will reprice over the next several years we have i dont know the percentage off the top of my head percentage of our loan book either fixed rate to begin with think of an auto loan or with swaps on top of it floating rate loan we swapped to fixed and those fixed rate loans and swaps are shorter duration typically than what we have in the securities book and theres a lot of dry powder there that will reprice we are back to this notion that hey were out there competing and growing this company we will be originating those loans as they reprice were not dumping assets and getting out of things its going to shrink the total volume thats on our book ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah no i totally understand i would think it would be a net positive as an offset to ph whatever thats happening william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc oh it will be ph close i mean you have the competing parts right were going to have repricings of fixed rate assets fighting reprices of our liabilities at some point thats going to cross and banks are going to grow nii at high percentages i just cant tell you when that is yet and we havent done our budget next year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats fair okay thank you operator and there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time william stanton demchak chairman
