louis corbat chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you liz and good morning everyone today we reported earnings for the first quarter of with net income of billion we had earnings per share of our earnings were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic werent felt until late in the quarter and we continued to show expense discipline however as you would expect credit costs reduced our net income the significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the daytwo impact of the new cecl accounting standard in our institutional clients group we had strong performance in our markets business as we helped clients navigate severe volatility that led to trading revenues that were higher than last year in what is typically a strong quarter for that business as it is treasury and trade solutions was impacted by the cuts to interest rates but client engagement stayed very strong throughout the quarter investment banking matched last years solid performance as we continued to gain share among our target clients global consumer banking also fared well from a revenue perspective considering the environment in the us we had strong revenue growth in cards with branded and retail services up and respectively we grew average deposits with another solid portion acquired digitally in asia we saw a slight revenue decline as the economic impacts of covid19 first materialized in that region in mexico revenues rose modestly excluding a onetime gain from as the virus had limited impact on that countrys economy during the quarter our tangible book value per share increased to at the end of the quarter up from a year ago we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio of as our riskweighted assets increased significantly due to increased client demand as ive said this isnt a financial crisis its a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications although we did have good revenue performance this quarter we exited the quarter in a dramatically different environment while we built significant loan loss reserves no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virus impact on the global economy will be that said we entered this crisis in a very strong position from a capital liquidity and balance sheet perspective we have the resources we need to serve our clients without jeopardizing our safety and soundness now id like to take a moment to highlight some of the things that were doing to help our people clients and communities which you can see on slide i have to say im very proud of how our people have responded to this fastmoving situation weve been very aggressive shifting to remote working to reduce our peoples chances of becoming infected where the spread of the virus dictates it we only have people going to our sites if theres no possible way they can perform their roles remotely for example last week in north america markets and securities services of our people worked remotely and globally our people adapted well to this new way of working with over of our colleagues working remotely the investments weve made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that wouldve been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time those investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether its a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 our investments in risk management and controls while never complete are also serving us well in the face of a severe economic downturn and large swings across markets whether in equities fixed income or commodities weve tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduce the stress theyre facing we decided last month to make a onetime payment of to employees who make or less per year in the us and are making equivalent payments in our international markets and weve halted new reductions in our workforce for the time being from a consumer and institutional perspective were wellpositioned to serve the clients and the customer segments weve been focusing on we know many consumers are facing real struggles and were doing our best to support them we were quick to implement the ways to reduce the burden on our consumer clients and announce additional accommodations last week in the us while we havent been a large player in small business lending were ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the payroll protection plan and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise were working hard to support our corporate clients many of whom are facing financial pressure weve been able to support them while keeping within our risk and liquidity limits weve also been helping the communities we serve during this extraordinarily difficult time partnering with groups like the world health organization citis foundations have already committed million todate to support those impacted and well make additional announcements in coming days weve donated personal protective equipment to hospital workers and last week we started using our cafeteria in our headquarters to make meals for food banks our people keep coming up with new ways to help and i couldnt be prouder and as a bank well do everything we can to support the broader economy we serve as a transmission mechanism for policymakers for both fiscal and monetary which they can use as a bridge to the real economy looking forward there are too many unknowns to count the path the virus will chart whether there will be successful interventions the action government leaders will take to either reopen the economy or put in place measures that will further restrict it we also have to bear in mind covid19 is a new disease and the medical guidance continues to evolve as you would expect but i feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that mark will go through our presentations and then wed be happy to answer your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you mike and good morning everyone starting on slide citigroup reported first quarter net income of billion results included a billion increase in credit reserves this quarter this reserve increase reflects the impact of changes in our economic outlook due to covid19 these bills are larger given the significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new cecl standard revenues of billion grew from the prior year primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of marktomarket gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio expenses were roughly flat yearoveryear and we were able to deliver positive operating leverage and a improvement in operating margin credit costs were billion this quarter our effective tax rate was for the first quarter below our full year outlook reflecting a small benefit associated with stockbased incentive compensation citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 the ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters the impact that we are already seeing varies across our franchise we saw the earliest impact on consumer behavior in asia as spending slowed in response to restrictions on travel and other commercial activity were seeing the same pattern today here in the us and now beginning in mexico which is likely to put pressure on loan balances however deposit growth remained strong across regions and were leveraging digital channels to engage with our client the rate environment has changed significantly our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three us rate cuts seen last year as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward although i would note that this is being partially offset in areas like tts where clients are moving volumes towards us as a stable partner of choice a similar dynamic is playing out in markets where we are also seen as a counterparty of choice additionally we are seeing higher corporate loan volumes reflecting drawdowns and new facilities given our clients response to the crisis and finally our performance in investment banking reflects the market volatility weve seen as well as the uncertainty that remains on the corporate side from the onset weve been focused on our employees and our clients and ensuring we maintain balance sheet strength to serve them through this uncertainty as of march our cet1 capital ratio was below our stated target of given our efforts to support our clients through this period additionally we had over billion in available liquidity to help support our client including the billion transition impact as we adopted cecl at the beginning of the year as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter credit reserves stand at roughly billion with a reserve ratio of on funded loans with the level of capital liquidity and the reserves we hold today plus significant preprovision earnings power we are operating from a position of strength were combining this financial strength with operational resiliency given investments in our people operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis turning now to each business slide shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars revenues grew as growth in north america was partially offset by lower revenues in asia reflecting the initial impact of covid19 on customer behavior expenses were roughly flat allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and improvement in operating margin total credit costs of billion were up significantly from last year including a reserve build of approximately billion primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook slide shows the results for north america consumer in more detail first quarter revenues of billion were up from last year although the impact of covid19 has only been felt in north america in recent weeks we have leveraged our experience in asia to inform our response strategy were one of the first banks in the us to provide assistance to help impacted customers starting in early march weve since expanded that support and continue to evaluate whether additional support is needed in addition the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this crisis citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at billion weve continued to drive mobile adoption up yearoveryear we made changes to allow our customers to use selfservice channels for more transactions including increased limits for atm withdrawals mobile check deposits and zelle transactions and we continue to launch new digitallyled value propositions such as citi wealth builder a new digital investment platform for clients in the emerging affluent segment these capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients even as roughly of our branches in the us are now temporarily closed driven by lower customer traffic particularly in urban areas turning out to the businesses branded cards revenue of billion grew yearoveryear driven by loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to basis points this quarter client engagement remained strong through february with purchase sales growth of roughly for the first two months of the quarter however as seen across the industry purchase sales declined significantly in late march with the implementation of more extensive lockdowns in many states categories like travel and entertainment have seen the biggest impact while there is been some offset from higher spending on essentials as well as higher online sales so in total we grew purchase sales in branded cards in the first quarter but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter which is expected to impact loan growth retail banking revenues of billion were largely unchanged yearoveryear as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits up as i noted earlier digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continued to adjust pricing given the current rate environment we also saw strong engagement with existing clients driving balance growth across ph deposit products including checking while aums declined by due to market movements we drove continued growth in citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity finally retail services revenues of billion were up yearoveryear reflecting lower partner payments and higher average loans purchase sales were down yearoveryear in the first quarter again including significant pressure in latemarch driven by reduced client activity and store closures at some of our partners this is expected to have an impact on new account acquisitions and loan balances as we move through the year total expenses for north america consumer were down yearoveryear as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volumerelated costs turning to credit total credit costs of billion increased significantly from last year we built roughly billion in reserves this quarter reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook and net credit losses grew by yearoveryear reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolio our ncl rates in us branded cards and retail services were and basis points respectively consistent with the uptick we typically see in the first quarter historically weve seen higher ncl rates in the first half versus the second half of the year however given the rapidly changing economic environment due to covid19 we are likely to see increased pressure on ncl rates in the back half of consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter on slide we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars in asia revenues declined yearoveryear in the first quarter despite the early emergence of covid19 in the region we saw strong citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 investment and fx revenues through most of the quarter this was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior we also saw an impact on customer acquisitions in products like insurance which rely more heavily on faceto face engagement however average deposit growth remained strong at this quarter and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise today we are seeing some early signs of a pickup in activity in china as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so but that is a small consumer business for us and of course many other markets are still in an earlier stage of managing through the crisis turning to latin america total consumer revenues were largely unchanged yearoveryear and grew excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business similar to other regions we saw good growth in deposits in mexico this quarter with average balances up and were also benefiting from improved spreads in card however we continued to see pressure on overall loan growth and while we havent yet seen the full impact from covid19 in mexico we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in march which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern weve seen in other regions in total operating expenses for our international business were up in the first quarter driven by mexico reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to million primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook slide provides additional detail on global consumer credit trend which shows the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter overall we have not seen a pronounced impact from covid19 on our credit statistics but it is still early we do anticipate rising unemployment and therefore a higher loss rate than originally expected for this year however it is unclear what benefit the historic trillion relief package as well as our own customer relief efforts will have in helping to mitigate some of the potential stress on consumers i would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures including investments in our operation and importantly as i noted on prior calls we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios both relative to the industry as well as citis historical risk exposures if you look at our us card portfolios as an example the fico distributions of our outstanding loans and open to buy exposures skew much more towards the higher end than before the crisis and as a result when we stress todays card portfolios to the same level as our pro forma loss rates are to lower than experienced in the last crisis in asia as you can see from our credit metrics we maintain a very low risk portfolio targeted at high quality consumers in both our unsecured and mortgage portfolio where our average ltv is less than in mexico we clearly serve a wider range of clients compared to our other region given our national footprint however we generally target a higherquality segment than our local peers the credit profile of our clients has improved over time as we have remained disciplined and tightened our lending criteria since the crisis which is reflected in our more stable ncl rates over the past few years we generate strong margins in mexico as well with the net credit margin in cards for example of roughly that said clearly the impact of covid19 is not fully known at this point and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 turning now to the institutional clients group on slide revenues of billion increased in the first quarter as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in tts and corporate lending the quarter also benefited from the impact of million of marktomarket gains on loan hedges as credit spreads widened during the quarter total banking revenues of billion decreased treasury and trade solutions revenues of billion were down as reported and in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates our global footprint enables us to have a unique relationship with our clients given the breadth of that relationship were playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented times we continue to see robust underlying business drivers in tts including growth in endofperiod deposits in constant dollars as well as growth in crossborder flow and we continue to see the benefit of our investment in technology given the accelerated adoption of digital tools in march while we as well as most of our clients were working remotely we opened close to accounts digitally three times the number we opened digitally in march of last year weve also seen rapid growth in citidirect users up yearoveryear in the quarter to over users and within that active mobile users increased tenfold this year but as we exited the quarter we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begin to take hold with revenues down yearoveryear in the month of march on a reported basis investment banking revenues of billion were largely unchanged from last year outperforming the market wallet as growth in ma and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting however i would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double digits yearoveryear as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment private bank revenues of million grew driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions and higher lending and deposit volumes partially offset lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower interest rates corporate lending revenues of million were down primarily reflecting an adjustment to the residual value of the lease financing as well as other marks on the portfolio and while average loans were roughly flat we did see a meaningful increase in endofperiod loans this quarter reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that i mentioned earlier as we continue to support our clients total markets and security services revenues of billion increased from last year fixed income revenues of billion grew yearoveryear with growth across rates and currencies and commodities as volatility volumes and spreads reach record levels we actively made markets during this turbulent period for both corporate and investor clients equities revenues of billion were up versus last year reflecting a strong performance in derivatives including an increasing client activity due to higher volatility and finally in securities services revenues were up on a reported basis and in constant dollars driven by higher client activity and deposit volume partially offset by lower spreads total operating expenses of billion increased yearoveryear as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs continued investments and volumedriven growth total credit costs of billion citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 were up significantly from last year we built roughly billion in reserves this quarter the increase in reserves primarily reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook as well as some downgrades along with volume growth in the portfolio as of quarter end our funded reserve ratio was basis points including a funded reserve ratio of roughly on the noninvestment grade portion we provide more details on the corporate portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation total nonaccrual loans increased sequentially this quarter but the ratio of nonaccrual to total corporate loans remained low at basis points overall we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today slide shows the results for corporateother revenues of million declined significantly from last year reflecting the winddown of legacy assets the impact of lower rates as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter expenses were down as the winddown of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs as well as incremental costs associated with covid19 including a special compensation award granted to roughly employees who are being most directly impacted by covid19 and the pretax loss was million this quarter higher than our previous outlook reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio marks on securities the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award slide shows our net interest revenue and margin trend in constant dollars total net interest revenue of billion this quarter declined slightly yearoveryear as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day along with higher tradingrelated ph nir on a sequential basis net interest revenue declined by roughly million reflecting a lower rate environment one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that i mentioned earlier and net interest margin declined basis points sequentially with lower net interest revenues driving roughly half of the decline and the remainder reflecting growth in the balance sheet turning to noninterest revenue in the first quarter healthy business performance for most of the quarter as well as a strong pickup in trading activity in march drove a significant increase in noninterest revenue as we look to the second quarter we expect both net interest revenues and noninterest revenues to decline reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates as well as a much more pronounced impact from covid19 on slide ph we show our key capital metrics during the quarter our cet1 capital ratio declined to driven mostly by the increase in riskweighted assets the increase in rwa reflected our support to our customers as well as increased market volatility and widening credit spreads our supplementary leverage ratio was and our tangible book value per share grew by to driven by net income and the reduced share count in summary the environment changed dramatically this quarter but we continued to operate well in a challenging environment we ended the period with a strong capital liquidity position we certainly saw the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our topline results as we exited the quarter but we feel good about our ability to manage risk through this cycle we remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higherquality more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 looking to the second quarter and the rest of let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters with that said given the adverse impact of covid19 we no longer expect to deliver the rotce of to for the full year based on what were seeing today on the top line we expect the revenue trends in the latter part of march and beginning of april characterized by covidrelated lower level of activity particularly in banking and our consumer franchise will continue through much of the second quarter and in our markets business revenue should reflect the broader industry the first quarter is typically the strongest quarter and clearly this year was particularly strong so we would expect some normalization in activity levels here and finally we will see the more pronounced impact of the lower rate environment on the top line on the expense side there are a couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses including the uncertainty of the impact of covid19 how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this and from this standpoint were being thoughtful about where we need to deploy resources to ensure we can deliver for our customers in a period where roughly of our workforce is working remotely here we feel good about the investments weve made over the last few years in technology these investments are allowing us to manage through this period and support our customers and clients through digital means however i would also note that during these unprecedented times we are also exploring all opportunities to operate as efficiently as possible and potentially repay certain investments we would have otherwise made in order to offset some of the headwinds created by covid19 we would also expect to see a natural reduction in some volumerelated expenses including te meetings and event costs so again theres a lot of uncertainty today but we will have more to say on both the top line impact as well as these efficiency efforts in the coming months as the impact of covid19 is better understood but that should hopefully give you a sense of how were thinking about the environment and our preprovision earnings power turning to credit looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook and as our outlook continues to evolve it is also reasonable to expect additional increases in credit reserves if our outlook deteriorates further however given the credit quality of our portfolio we remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability as well as continue to support our customers and win new business undoubtedly every company around the world will feel an economic impact from this unprecedented situation but we are confident that citi will emerge in a position of strength having demonstrated that we lived up to our stated objective to be an indisputably strong and stable institution and having shown that we stood by our clients and supported our customers and employees during this very difficult time with that mike and i are happy to take any questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much curious if youd give us a little bit more of the assumptions behind the reserve build and because card is a little bigger for you guys im curious if you could talk about the reserve on how you think about it from a branded versus retail services partner card perspective thanks michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure good morning glenn so you can glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc turn to page weve broken out some additional details here and you can see we started or ended the year i should say with about billion in reserves youre right the lions share of that is in cards and split between branded and retail and our focus obviously tends to be on the higher fico scored clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services but not quite as high as on the cards side so thats going to impact a little bit the split between the two you can see in terms of the day one impact that was about billion we talked about that on the last call and we built another billion so that gets us to a total reserve balance of almost billion what id point out is the cards piece obviously is at roughly of llr to loans but again we tend to think of this as a higher quality book in terms of the factors that become important there are a host of variables that we run through our model as well as combined with severity of a recession probability of a recession i would say that the two most critical as it relates to card and again theyre all important and understanding how they work together becomes important but two very important ones become obviously gdp and unemployment and how that affects the underlying behavior of the consumer in each of those instances obviously the retail services there are partners that we have that are more directly impacted by the covid19 situation but we also have the trillion relief stimulus thats been introduced and little bit unclear as to how that ultimately plays out and impacts the behavior so lots of puts and takes going through the model those economic assumptions changed kind of straight through the end of the quarter but the short of it is that based on our outlook as of then this additional build of billion for cards was the appropriate amount for us to take citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats very helpful insight thank you maybe just one followup on im curious your view because youre in the midst of all of it of how much has the financial plumbing been improved by some of the government actions and then where most importantly where you see that we need the most improvement ph lest to to come on the plumbing things like line markets cp im talking about thanks michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc glenn i would say that the actions that weve seen out of the combination of the fed and the treasury are truly extraordinary not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs but i think the breadth thats there and the speed of which theyve implemented them whether its been the cp facility the money market liquidity facility the repo facilities the broader corporate pieces the sba loans and now not something thats being talked about that much but is this main street program thats there and i think from a plumbing perspective your questions a good one because obviously the real economy doesnt have direct access to the fed or to the treasury and i think its the banks and in particular the big banks role one of many roles that we play to be that transmission mechanism between fiscal monetary and the real economy and i think you can just see in terms of in the early days how the markets were trading a lot of the fears and concerns that was there and whether it was the early fears of draws whether it was the early fears of money funds and being able to get liquidity across the board and i think the programs have gone a long way i think theres still a few things out there that probably need some work certainly as an institution as an industry were in constant dialogue with the fed and the treasury on those and again as i suspect as those things create challenges its likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies to be able to address it so i think the plumbing is actually working pretty well that in spite of working remotely in the numbers that mark and i spoke to we had in latemarch record volumes of trading in terms of settlement clearing margin margining in the system and again most of that done remotely and we all wouldve said to each other months ago were going to model for this type of stress we probably all wouldve been skeptical in terms of how the system performs so im proud of how weve performed and im quite pleased so far how the system has performed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi excellent thank you both michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i just wanted to michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you mark hi wanted to clarify your statement on card losses so just wanted to make sure i was interpreting it correctly you said that the losses today the cumulative losses today could be lower than the global financial crisis experience and when i look back at the regulatory data and ph would add up to a loss rate so wanted just to make sure we were interpreting that correctly that you could see losses of to in card in a cumulative loss scenario which is about in line with both the company run dfast and the fed stress test mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure what i said was that if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality than it was back in and you were to stress it for the financial crisis that yes our pro forma loss rates would be to lower than what we experienced in the last crisis thats what i said mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and i think to be clear basically thats not a prediction its just a level setting based on historic data michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and one of your peers noted in a call yesterday that they were comfortable going below their regulatory minimum of to service clients and im wondering what citis stance is ongoing below that bright line especially since thats where the automatic distributions on dividend and other payouts kick in mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah why dont i start mike or citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure go ahead mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look i think our view is we are clearly living in an uncertain period of time the crisis were facing is unprecedented and if i think about our objectives primary objective ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees second to that or in addition to that ensuring that we are positioned to serve our clients our customers and to play an important role in stabilizing the economy and so when i think about the combination of those things we want to be there for our clients and i think were expected to be there for our clients in a period like this and youve seen our cet1 ratio drop to this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve were going to be there for them and if that means that our ratio takes more pressure then well manage through that if we were to drop below the you referenced theres still plenty of room between that and the use of the buffer that the regulators have authorized and so were managing it thoughtfully diligently but in the context of those priorities that i mentioned erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning how are you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning betsy michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc question as it relates to the use of that capital part of it is coming from the drawdowns and i wanted to understand how you think your clients are going to be using those drawdowns do you expect them to persist for many quarters many years or do you think that we will over the next months see some paydown of that citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 through terming out in the capital markets and maybe also give us a sense as to the associated deposits how much of the drawdowns came back into your liquidity view of the deposits and persistency there as well would be helpful thanks michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah so betsy i would say kind of looking at the numbers we had roughly right around about billion billion worth of draws in the first quarter so somewhere of our outstanding but unfunded so i wouldnt call that an overly meaningful number and i think going back to my earlier comment to glenn i think that the extraordinary actions taken in the cp facilities in terms of some of the corporate facilities some of the sba or probably more likely the main street lending facilities alleviates a lot of that pressure i think we saw two things there there were clearly those industries that were under stress and those were pretty easily identifiable along the list that mark had described and then i think there were those that just believed that it was a good time to bring in liquidity and i think as the fed programs and the treasury programs came into place the bond markets reopened you saw a record issuance of debt in the late first quarter and again when you look at our portfolio its predominantly an investment grade portfolio and that investment grade portfolio in times with those programs in place has access to the capital markets and so we saw people shift there obviously its something were paying attention to were in constant dialogue with our clients but again i think certainly coming into the second quarter weve actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and i think in our dialogues we dont see or feel that pressure right now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then on the deposit side can you give us a sense as to the percentage of the draws that went into deposits and how you think about the persistency of those deposits as well mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me comment a little more broadly on the deposits so the icg deposits that we saw come in in the month of march were about billion so deposits grew pretty significantly just in the month of march and if i break that down about a third of that were from corporate clients that built liquidity through draws or issuance and its not necessarily just liquidity just draws from us but about a third of it we would attribute as being tied towards that increase in liquidity draws or issuances that theyve done about a third were from brokerdealers clearinghouses and financial institutions as they bolstered kind of their liquidity buffers and then a third were from investor clients derisking and moving to cash and so that gives you a little bit of a sense for the mix we obviously look at the persistency of the deposits and some of those are certainly operating deposits and i think part of what will inform the view to some extent is as mike described the additional channels that are now available for clients to access additional liquidity as needed but also how long this persists and theres a fair amount of uncertainty as you heard us reference as to how long this crisis were managing through persists so hopefully that gives you a sense betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 got it and the fact that the drawdowns have slowed dramatically de minimis in your words mike the pressure i would expect going forward on cet1 is going to pull back as well so maybe if you could give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that and then in the context of that how youre thinking about the dividend thanks michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure so i think as mark described the way we thought about you saw us kind of put our balance sheet to use and you saw the cet1 move from the to the clearly leaving us lots of room lots of buffer and again were early in this we dont know where this will go but our gut or how were thinking about this is this recovery is going to be uneven i would say that as a team weve pretty well discounted a uniform vshaped recovery the question is it ushaped is it wshaped are parts of it lshaped and i think we want to retain a lot of flexibility and capacity to be able to step into the situations that count and again i think as we said that includes two roles one is how do we use our own balance sheet and then how do we actually use and bring to life a lot of these programs the continued programs that are being put out there by the fed and the treasury so in the right situations were prepared to let that ratio go down were in conversations with our board we are in conversations with our regulator and i think mark said we feel that weve got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend but again were going to treat that as a time when it comes but to be clear in our capacity here and the way were looking at things we remain committed to paying our dividend betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning a couple more questions on the card business if you dont mind so just if you kind of separate the branded cards from the retail services and can you help us talk about just what youre seeing relatively speaking in terms of we can see it in the rate of change that happened in the first quarter but would you expect a divergence in either spend trends volume balances and credit as this evolves any color you can help us with there thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure why dont i start just in terms of the spend and so in the quarter if i think about kind of the last week of march the card spend activity just broadly for us was down about us spend by category down a total of the big categories if you will impacted are not going to be of any surprise to you travel down dining and entertainment down some discretionary retail which would include apparel department stores et cetera down essentials were up and so as i think you would expect and again that got us to a total of down about in just the last week we all have seen what has continued to happen over the past couple of weeks and so we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter in light of the way this is citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 persisting and that should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes in which we expect to see some top line pressure there similarly as you referenced we have a large retail services business and we have partnered clients who we advise in that regard and weve been working with them to help drive sales digitally but obviously the shutdown of most of the economy and the stayathome orders as well as the temporary store closures across most of the country will certainly impact our partners and our results including a slowdown in new customer acquisitions as well as again a lower purchase sales volume through that part of our business that said weve got a number of partners who do operate large partners i should say who do operate as essential resources to the economy and while theyll have lower store traffic they will be able to continue to kind of serve and then ultimately as i said we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in ncls subject to of course how things like the trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thank you and just a follow up should and if balances come down just given that card is such a bigger part of your balance sheet is there a positive offset that comes through with regard to the reserving needs just wondering how cards specifically for you guys and that in and out with regards to spend and outstandings informs how the ins and outs of card reserve builds if thats a fair question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes if you think about cecl and how it works and the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter there are a number of factors that come into play so your probability of recession your severity of recession our view on the important economic variables and how theyre going to play out as well as balances and so as the balances shift and the mix and the makeup of those balances shift thats going to have an impact on what we would expect in the way of those lifetime losses and therefore what we would expect in the way of how that reserve balance would move ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks a lot mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so in the us indiscernible citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc theres obviously a lot of efforts underway to kind of soften the blow to the consumer as we think about credit losses theres the fiscal health theres payment deferrals maybe you could just talk about kind of whats going on in mexico and asia and some of your bigger markets there in terms of things that might soften the blow for the consumer and is it as meaningful as kind of what were seeing here or how do you factor that into your thought process on potential losses michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah matt i think thats a great question and i think as you think about or as we think about all the places we come to work i think weve got to use a series of lenses to really look at where these countries and these economies are i would say one is that youve got to look first at the health crisis response have the governments taken it seriously have they put measures have they put social distancing have they put stay in place types of things and whats the trajectory of that look like i think the second piece is around what you see in terms of both monetary and fiscal response and not just whats been to date but whats been the capacity of those economies to be able to implement those and more things potentially into the future and i think the third important piece that we look at is the underlying demographics of the economy as an example do they have big exposures or are they dependent on oil exports or other commodities or other types of things where theres concentrations around that and so i would say that its not by region it is really and we are taking really a countrybycountry approach to what that is and i think youve seen it all over the map in terms of very strong responses out of the us out of japan youve seen some responses out of europe and i think youve seen some of those that are slower in particular to your question on mexico is we know the president has labeled himself a fiscal hawk and i think he has been reluctant to use any type of outsized spending to go at this crisis to date and obviously were watching that carefully weve tried to be pretty prudent in terms of our credit standards there and the things that were doing and were obviously watching it closely matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and i just want to follow up on that remind us i think your targeted customer base in mexico is much higher than say the broadbased customer so maybe just remind us about some of the credit metrics in the card portfolio of ph mexico specifically thank you michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc mark do you want to mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i dont have the credit metrics available what i would say is that while we do appeal to the broader population there we do tend to focus on the higherend certainly relative to our peer players in that mexico market and so we do skew to the higherend in terms of the credit profile citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 they have a different system than the fico system per se and we actually have been very closely monitoring as youve seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have in fact trended lower than that of the broader industry as weve been quite vigilant about focusing staying inside of our risk parameters which again do skew higher than most of the peers in that country matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay thats helpful thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo security mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc sorry if i missed part of this in terms of additional reserve builds ahead another billion in the second or third quarter yes no maybe mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi mike let me make a couple comments to that one again a lot of uncertainty here dealing with a significant crisis as you well know even as we have closed out this quarter the variables that we look at continue to shift meaningfully i would expect that with that as a backdrop and again subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter and thats kind of where we are i mean im not going to weve got the rest of the quarter to play out weve got analysis and models that we have to do we have consumers that have to respond to much of the stimulus thats out there weve got to understand how it continues to impact the different businesses that were in its way too early to give you any sense for what that number is mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and what lessons have you learned from asia i mean the virus was there first you should have a little more of a head start than other banks that dont have that experience and what are you seeing in terms of volumes and credit losses and your ability to work with the clients mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah so i think that citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc go ahead mike sorry michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i would say that in some ways mike we if you want to call it that have been fortunate to have lived that and i think we took a lot of lessons and i think you saw in our actions in terms of the moves we took in terms of getting people remotely getting people home the types of client engagement and i would say lesson one that were watching very closely is the resurgence of cases as people start to come back in and so i think weve got to be very mindful about how and when or when and how we in fact do that you saw us in very early march go out i think as the first us bank to go out and engage around in particular our consumer customers in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged and i think to marks point and you can see it in the credit numbers that so far relatively benign and weve been putting programs in place in most if not all of our asian countries in terms of similar types of forbearance programs and really trying to engage around that so its early but again you can see the numbers that were probably days in or so that we probably had a reasonably full february and march in terms of covid19 in terms of asia but again were watching the numbers closely but its around the engagement and the programs and some of it was dusting off the playbooks from and some of the things in between mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if i can just follow up you talked about the resurgence of cases when people come back in in asia are your employees coming back yet are you seeing this or is this just thirdparty medical advice that youre receiving are you seeing this firsthand and when do you plan to open asia back up citi asia i mean how many people are working remote how many people are in the office michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah you may have missed it but we talked a little bit earlier mike in terms of the unevenness of this that when you think of this virus that its not only uneven in terms of pacing in terms of where we are in the world weve got at least a two to three span just in the united states in terms of where the virus is and within asia weve seen probably the most concerted efforts to get people back in in terms of china and i would say we are largely back there i think the last numbers i looked at as of yesterday we were about two thirds back in terms of hong kong and i would say most of the rest of the region at lower levels than that and so were taking a very specific or very sitebysite view in terms of how we bring people back so first criteria is where is the virus in its trajectory second criteria is what are the things that happen at a site that are very difficult to replicate in a remote environment and then in terms of addressing that whats the safest way we can begin to bring people back so i think citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats pretty remarkable two thirds back in hong kong so is that cautiously optimistic for whats ahead here or dont read too much michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc again i think its place by place so i think were taking kind of a site by site but at the same time understand and again you probably missed this part of it were absolutely open for business were just working differently if you look at the things that weve accomplished just in the month of march its not that were not at work as an example yesterday we had over people accessing our systems remotely at one time our peak surge was of those people on simultaneously you think about the things that have accomplished mark and his finance team closed the quarter on a trillion balance sheet you look at the submission of ccar you look at all of the things the remediation efforts the small business programs all being applied remotely so again its going to be bespoke in terms of how we do it as mark said with an eye towards making sure we keep our people safe and at the same time doing everything we can do to service our customers and clients through this extraordinary time and its going to be case by case mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks operator your next question is from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi hey good morning guys mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey saul good morning saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc a couple of cecl questions so please bear with me but first i want to get your perspective on dfast stress losses and whether you think its a good reference point to judge reserve adequacy under cecl because we do citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 get a lot of questions asking why allowance levels are so much below what the ninequarter stress losses are in the severely adverse scenario and the adverse scenario and i think thats true of you guys my personal view is that dfast is a useful data point but that there are fundamental differences obviously beyond the differences in the economic scenarios used the point of dfast is to estimate loss absorbing capacity in a severe downturn and maybe estimates are going to be on the conservative end of losses whereas under cecl these are point in time estimates that are your best guesses of what your losses will be over the life of the loans under an economic scenario so let alone the lot of methodological differences in terms of how you calculate those things in terms of things like weighted average ph mean life or whatever it is but im curious if you have a perspective and whether you think the stress losses should be sort of a reference point or how useful they are to measure whether a given bank or your bank has adequate reserves michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look i think that you said a lot there i think that it is a reference point i think youve highlighted some meaningful differences in the approaches and perspectives everything from the modeling the assumptions et cetera et cetera and so i think it does serve as a reference point but i think what were experiencing now and even as we submitted a plan from a ccar point of view is that thats a scenario it certainly is a stress scenario but were now living through a real life stress situation and i think that scenario is meant to those scenarios are meant to inform a firms ability to withstand stress but weve got a real test here that has put us and i think the industry in a position where we are constantly modeling and demonstrating our ability to withstand realtime pressures and the prospect of real life losses now with that said cecl a new approach i think that the timing is interesting in that we get to see we see a meaningful shift between transition and dayone which i would think in a normal environment you wouldnt see that type of dramatic shift but again thats informed by a view a forwardlooking view of what is now a crisis in a stressed environment and so that magnitude of the change that we see in the day two is a direct byproduct of that and i think what well see is that continues to that what we do in the way of forward reserves will continue to be informed by that and what we ultimately experience in losses however will be informed by how much of the uncertainty that i talked to plays out so again no stress scenario thats been created thus far wouldve contemplated the amount of fiscal response and monetary response that weve seen in short order and so thats not modeled and how customers or consumers react to that is not part of any ccar dfast model that we wouldve run how that offsets the impact of unemployment or ultimately losses is completely unclear and so theres a fair amount yes its a data point but theres a fair amount of uncertainty and now differences i would expect in light of now managing through a real life scenario saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc thats helpful if i could follow up you guys use one scenario most large banks use multiple scenarios in calculating their reserves and sorry if i missed this but can you just outline the sort of big picture some of the citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 big picture assumptions youre using whether its global growth or us growth or unemployment that underlie that scenario and i guess as sort of an adjunct to that does using one scenario create more volatility because if you use a scenario analysis you can kind of calibrate between different outcomes whereas its more of a big change if you change your outlook if its just one scenario to another in your case as opposed to maybe a grade of different outcomes if you were to use sort of a weighted average scenario analysis that most banks use do you think it creates more volatility and more ph jumps and releases than you otherwise would have michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah so we do use a model approach where we use a scenario but what i would say is that that scenario is informed by a kind of a further management adjustment and the factors that are considered are not only thousands of variables like gdp and unemployment and many many many other stats given the nature of the business that we do but also the probability of recession and the severity of a recession and we can toggle in our management adjustment degrees of severity that we would expect in a recession whether thats in terms of the severity relative to a recession or whatever the case may be so while we do use a model and one scenario there is flex there if you will in terms of ensuring that we capture what we think best reflects the forward view of the economic outlook in our analysis in terms of as i may have mentioned i think i mentioned earlier at some point you got to put a stake in the ground at the end of the quarter and look at the assumptions that we have to work with in terms of those thousands of variables and certainly the key ones that i mentioned and this quarter in particular weve seen things continue to move and so even the view that we would have taken at the end of the quarter around many of those metrics the outlook on them has continued to shift and so we find ourselves running various scenarios to understand the impact on our ratios and on our estimated losses including ranges of unemployment from to and gdp declines from to and were constantly kind of running those scenarios to understand the implications on our cet1 ratio and other important metrics that are required to properly run and manage and plan at the firm saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thats really helpful thank you operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks mark just a quick question first on the icg and the reserve coverage there i know that you said that youre comfortable with it but we kind of look at the reserves that you have against the total exposures its about basis points against all the exposures but yet youre looking at noninvestment grade being of the portfolio so what kind of metrics are you keying on to get comfort there it doesnt seem like it takes a large amount of delinquencies also and have a large increase in losses mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 yeah look weve got there are a series of metrics that we use in the case of the icg gdp is an important metric obviously a view on downgrades is an important metric a view on energy prices oil prices is an important metric and as you we dont have the entire portfolio parsed here but that basis points is going to be a mix of where we feel as though we need to have more reserves and so one example is that when you we built additional reserves and you can look at kind of our reserve ratio for the energy sector for example and thats closer to in terms of the funded reserve ratio and so i highlight that as just a simple example of obviously theyre going to be some higher some lower and in terms of the broader noninvestment grade similar to that example i just gave you the broader noninvestment grade bucket is closer to in terms of the reserve ratio so again i can understand the question given the basis points but we obviously are using good judgment as we look through the different risk profile of the portfolio brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then with regard to the guidance youre giving about how march and april could trend out to the rest of the quarter is there ph any way you can give an update on kind of and im sorry if you gave it already but how purchase sales were trending in april and how the revenues and tts were trending in april you said march they were down in tts has that gotten worse in april thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure i dont have the spend activity at hand as i look here for april im not sure if you caught what i said earlier but the card spend activity towards the end of march the last week in march has been around down with the mix across the differences in the different categories in terms of tts again i dont have the april stats we did see kind of pressure in the month of march and what i was referencing there was the right pressure playing through in terms of commercial card activity just as another proxy for spend similar to the retail card or consumer card spend levels that was down pretty meaningfully we said a lot about our corporate client base in terms of the te commercial card spend was down almost and kind of b2b businesstobusiness commercial card activity was down some in the month of march and so but likely those trends continue however i would kind of just note that we continue to see very good engagement with our tts client base and we see that in the higher volumes that we saw in q1 we expect that that will continue we see that in the new accounts that were opening with them we would expect that to continue including utilizing many of our digital capabilities there and frankly as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with we would expect that were going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like and so the metrics will move the top line will move in light of the rate environment but i think those underlying drivers if you will say a lot about what the future prospects are for the firm here brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2020 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc mike do you want to comment on michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc if i can just quickly mark before we close out here i just want to go back to mikes question and apologize for having flipped my numbers weve got globally over of our staff working remotely and the number in hong kong is that weve got about a third back and twothirds still working remotely so mike i apologize for getting that one inverted operator with that i think that concludes the call elizabeth lynn managing director head of investor relations
