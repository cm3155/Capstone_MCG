bancorp thank you travis and welcome to those of you on the call as usual i will provide some big picture thoughts on valleys position and future opportunities before i turn the call over to mike to discuss the quarters results in the third quarter of we reported net income of million earnings per share of and return on average assets of the quarters strong financial results benefited from our differentiated loan growth which helped to absorb a million sequential reduction in ppp income our net interest margin remained stable and our strong loan growth pipeline should result in continued nonppp revenue growth going forward i am proud of our financial results and the progress that we have made as an organization over the last few years when i took over as ceo we laid out a plan to enhance our profitability improve our funding base and bolster our capital and reserve positions despite a challenging operating backdrop i believe that we have achieved each of these goals since the end of our roa has improved from basis points to basis points while the balance sheet grew by over billion or we have brought our loan to deposit ratio well below while significantly improving our low cost core deposit base our tangible common equity ratio has increased basis points and our allowance to loans is up over basis points while we have developed a leading regional bank our sights are now set on positioning valley for continued success during the next phase of our evolution we have begun to introduce and expand nationwide business capabilities that are not constrained to our legacy geographic footprint these capabilities will be the result of both internal development initiatives and the acquisitions that we have announced over the last few months from an organic perspective we have developed robust hoa cannabis and digital banking offerings which each contributed valuable funding diversity and represented levers for continued growth we also operate national lending verticals most notably in the equipment finance premium finance and healthcare areas we have also leveraged our relationshipfocused commercial lending expertise to enter new markets including philadelphia nashville and atlanta on the acquisition front we have sought out likeminded partners that we believe will accelerate the next phase of our evolution bank leumis technology banking and private banking businesses will continue to expand valley beyond our legacy markets leumis differentiated commercial funding verticals will augment the valleyspecific initiatives that i mentioned previously as we continue to capitalize on these unique funding niches we will continue to be less and less reliant upon our branch network this will enable us to reduce our physical infrastructure and invest in technologies and differentiated business capabilities this strategy has not been set in a vacuum and we are not sitting idly by as the banking industry undergoes massive change historic levels of bank ma have left a void for companies like ours that are able to combine comprehensive and differentiated ph private offerings with the agility and high touch service of a smaller organization as valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 we capitalize on the disruption around us valley is positioned to be a high performing and highly valued company that succeeds in the new age of banking with that ill turn the call over to mike hagedorn to discuss some of the quarters financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide you can see valleys recent net interest income and margin trends with and without the impacts of ppp net interest income was flat for the quarter despite a million reduction in ppp income this reflected funding cost reductions and higher nonppp loan income resulting from our strong growth over the last few quarters on a reported basis net interest margin declined basis points to however exclusive of ppp income the net interest margin would have been flat at with fewer opportunities to redeem higher cost debt we utilized cash to modestly grow the securities portfolio during the quarter as cash balances remain elevated we are likely to continue this deployment for the next few quarters despite our efforts the higher average cash balance weighed on our quarterly net interest margin by approximately basis points slide illustrates the ongoing transition of our funding base over the last few years we have refocused and accelerated our commercial deposit growth and rolled out new funding niches that will provide additional sources of low cost sticky deposits going forward these efforts have enabled us to reduce our reliance on higher cost cds and borrowings to of funding from at the end of our continued focus on scaling these initiatives will benefit us as the liquidity environment normalizes we continue to transition deposits from cds to lower cost transaction accounts our active management of deposit costs in all buckets has also contributed to our recent margin stability during the quarter our cd and non maturity deposit cost declined basis points and basis points respectively over the next months we have approximately billion of cds set to mature at an average cost of basis points while this represents another opportunity to reprice funding costs lower the potential impact will be less meaningful than what we have experienced over the last few quarters slide details our loan balances and origination trends over the last few quarters we continue to experience very strong lending activity across our markets and asset classes the quarters loan originations were split almost evenly between commercial southeast commercial and residential and consumer importantly our average origination yield increased basis points and spreads remain attractive exclusive of ppp loans increased from the prior quarter you can see at the top left the composition of our portfolio based on our view of the portfolio approximately is commercial real estate and is commercial business which includes owneroccupied cre our diverse loan portfolio is a key differentiator for our organization and the multiple growth levers have contributed to our strong yeartodate results we continue to believe that loan growth will remain at the high end of the middle single digit guidance we provided previously our loan pipeline stands at approximately billion and recent lending hires are beginning to contribute more production to our portfolio moving to slide we generated noninterest income of million for the quarter the million decline in gainonsale income was largely mitigated by higher swap income service charges and other income earlier this month we announced the acquisition of dudley ventures dudley generates fee income through the placement and management of tax credit investments and will support our efforts to build differentiated sources of non interest income valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 on slide you can see that our reported expenses were million for the quarter ph exclusive of tax credit amortization and both merger charges and a litigation reserve which flowed through our professional fee line adjusted expenses were million the adjusted increase was concentrated in compensation costs consulting fees and the other expense category there were a few key drivers of higher compensation costs during the quarter the first is elevated origination activity over the last few quarters which has impacted performancebased compensation accruals and commissions we also increased our branch compensation to preserve staffing and service levels and to keep pace with the increases in wage demand across the industry we continue to invest in areas that we believe will drive outsized revenue growth in the future during the quarter we rolled out a new national deposit group and continued to attract leading talent in our digital products area we utilized consultants to assist on other process improvement initiatives we expect that these consulting costs will fluctuate going forward we also recognized nearly million of other periodic costs and fair value marks during the quarter these expenses are difficult to predict from a timing perspective while we do not expect these elevated costs to continue in the fourth quarter some are marketdriven and activitybased since the beginning of our revenue growth has outpaced expense growth to this is a strong track record in a challenging environment and we will continue to produce positive operating leverage over time in the short term we may absorb expenses that position us for stronger revenue growth down the road but we remain thoughtful in the investments that we make and ensure that we execute on the significant opportunities available to us while the timing of certain expenses and investments may cause volatility in our operating leverage in the near term we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage over the long term turning to slide you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters our allowance for credit losses declined to of nonppp loans at september from at june third quarter net chargeoffs were de minimis and our million provision was the result of the strong loan growth during the quarter for the second consecutive quarter an improved economic forecast led us to reduce our weighting on moodys downside scenarios our model is now currently weighted to the baseline scenario which has positively impacted our reserve levels our nonaccrual loan balances ticked up to basis points from basis points of total loans in the prior quarter this increase was driven by three commercial real estate credits that transitioned out of early stage delinquency the credits total million and carry a specific reserve of nearly million early stage accruing past due loans declined during the quarter and our covidrelated deferrals fell below million covid deferrals now stand at just of loans and additional detail on outstanding loan deferrals can be found in the appendix slide illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and our continued capital strength tangible book value has increased in the last months driven by our strong earnings performance our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio increased to as september from at june ppp loans reduced our tangible common equity ratio by approximately basis points at the end of the quarter total riskbased capital declined basis points in the quarter as a result of the partial disallowance of certain legacy subordinated debt tranches you will recall that our successful subordinated debt offering during valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 the second quarter was done partially to prefund this disallowance we remain very comfortable with all of our capital ratios and believe that our strong earnings will support our organic growth efforts going forward with that ill turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steven michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on the expense side quite a few items came in a bit above what we were expecting do you guys consider the million adjusted as a good run rate and how should we think about expense growth just given the wage pressures that you guys called out michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp ill take a stab at this one steven when we look at the current expense level we expect the fourth quarter expenses to be within a range of roughly million to million but as i said in my prepared remarks some of those expenses are in people and compensationrelated areas that address specifically what you asked around higher compensation costs especially in the retail part of our business we also have hired as i mentioned a national deposits group and we also have significant hiring in our digital group as well you may have seen recently our cannabisrelated digital product offering that was recently at a trade show was predominantly seen as a new product in the marketplace so were making investments upfront in these areas that will result in higher growth and higher revenue down the road they dont always obviously line up with one another steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 okay excellent thank you actually i wanted to follow up on the launch of valley pay will that platform apply only to the cannabis business or is it more broad and maybe could you just walk us through the benefit that that will provide the companies in the cannabis industry ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steven i think it provides the beginning of a payment platform for the industry which really doesnt exist today were trying to work with our customers here to figure out a solution as to how they can connect with their customers in a safe and secure manner so while this closed loop platform provides the initial ability for them to accept payments from a digital perspective we do believe that there will be alternative offerings as we continue to really grow this so we do believe that there is additional opportunities associated with this and that said i think as we think about the growth here and whether it applies to different industries i think theres definitely opportunities and one of the things that were fortunate to be is the size organization we are we were able to hire some wonderful talent to come here and look at doing things a little bit differently we were able to stand up this platform in six months which i think is unique compared to what other organizations are able to really do and that culture that environment i really do think creates opportunity when it comes to a multitude of different product sets throughout the organization steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and ill add one more thing maybe to the end of that as i said in my prepared remarks operating leverage is very important to us and so we havent lost sight of that over the long haul and neither should any of the sell side analysts as well but as you well know cyclicality in expenses sometimes come into play and theres times to invest when the market conditions are right and theres times to scale back and its our belief at this point right now that scaling up in certain areas makes sense given whats going on in the broader economy steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then my final question just on this acquisition of dudley ventures can you just walk us through their business model and what type of financial contribution should we expect from that deal thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah the financial part of it we havent talked about publicly so its not going to be material from a financial perspective but essentially what dudley does is they are a tax credit recipient from the federal government and then they work with clients who want to have tax credits as part of their investment portfolio so theyre the entity that makes sure that those credits get to the right places there have been several banks that have been in this industry as well but i think the bigger part of this is its another thing that we can do do effectively and sell into our existing customer base thats really the reason that we did this valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay okay thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael perito from kbw your line is now open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey everyone thank you for taking my questions appreciate it i want to stick on the cannabis sector for a second i was wondering ira if youre willing to kind of try and size up the market share opportunity in some way or the addressable market there for us i mean it seems like theres only a handful of banks really operating in the space in any way today and most of them at least that i read its more of just like hey were willing to take your deposits not really anyone thats trying to really provide kind of solutions any points of friction like valley pay theoretically might solve so just curious if you could help us maybe kind of think of the overall scope of that market i mean it seems like you guys are kind of fast movers here and just trying to get a better handle of that ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah thank you i definitely think our approach is very differentiated to your point michael most of our competition in the space has looked at it as how i can benefit them from a deposit or from a fee perspective and our approach has been very different in talking to our potential customers and current customers as to how we can be advisory and think about solutions for them that really makes sense so weve started out targeting the multistate operators and we have a very strong relationship with each of them as to how we think we can provide benefits to them as they think about growing their overall businesses keep in mind its a very immature business at this point which creates a lot of opportunity for us to think collaboratively with them as to how we can provide value for them which also nursed our overall bottom line its a very segmented business today and we think that we provide a leading opportunity to gain significant market share in this business today michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and is the valley pay are there deposit opportunities around this payment infrastructure im trying to kind of think about the technology itself and think of some of the other like theres some of the other realtime payment platforms that some of your competitors have done whether theres actually decent deposit generation because people have to hold cash with the banks to move it around and is there kind of longer term as more people adopt this payment technology that you guys are rolling out is there kind of deposit growth opportunity that kind of move lockstep with it ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 absolutely this is a closed loop platform which basically provides an opportunity from a deposit perspective from the dispensary side as well as from the consumer side so we think well be able to gain deposits on both sides and once again its a market that is very difficult to enter today it took us months to begin to get into this as to how we thought about the risk appetite the compliance components associated with it and to stand up the overall platform and once again work with our customers to make sure that were providing a valueadded service to them so we think theres absolutely a deposit opportunity on both sides here because its a closed loop platform as well as being a fee opportunity michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great two more things i want to hit on quickly just mike i was curious if you could maybe provide an update on how you think the balance sheet is positioned for higher shortterm rates obviously theres a lot going on and kind of beneath the ph engine here and then the funding basis kind of moving towards some lower cost seemingly maybe more sticky instruments and the loan portfolio is more diverse than its been historically i was wondering if you could just provide some updated thoughts once all these deals are kind of put together where you think the bank positioning stands michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think our positioning has probably never been better in the history of the company to be honest i know in the last decadeplus weve never had a lower cost of deposits at basis points and as you can see in the investor presentation the loan yield on newly originated loans is actually up basis points so we feel really good about both sides of the balance sheet as it relates to how were funding ourselves the growth there has been speaks for itself its been unbelievable and whats going on on the lending side which on an linkedquarter annualized basis we feel its right in line with what weve talked about but we feel very good about that as it relates to the future as it relates to changes in interest rates you can see that in our sec filings we are asset sensitive and maybe not so much to your question but i think its important leumi that will be part of our organization assuming we get approvals will be part of our organization next year theyre also asset sensitive and thats going to help us become even more asset sensitive and just to dimension that in an up basis point parallel change in interest rates our net interest income would be expected to go up somewhere in the neighborhood of around or so and i think as we continue to work with our cash balances as well youre only going to see that number increase michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and that thats just where the balance sheet stood at quarter end so moving to be a bit additive to that correct michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah that is correct michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 okay thats perfect thank you and then just lastly and then ill hop out is just on the credits appreciate the color there were a pickup in nonaccrual some pickup in delinquencies across some of the reporting new york city metro banks well generally call it and just curious if theres anything kind of more brewing or anything youre keeping your eye on i mean it seems like the incidents were fairly isolated but to see it happen at a few banks im just curious if theres some kind of real estate churn that might maybe get value down or anything that we should be mindful of on the credit side as we move into next year thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey its tom so ill give you an answer on that yeah as you saw our accruing pastdues went down pretty much in relation to the increase in those delinquencies specific to three loans totaling million all independent separate borrowers all three were in covidimpacted industries two in retail one in hospitality we certainly watch it very very closely were properly reserved we dont expect any losses we have good loan to values and guarantees where appropriate on that just want to remind you our portfolio continues to be very granular and very diverse our loan production on the real estate side for the third quarter the average loan size was million so we still look at that maintaining our underwriting standings maintaining a granular portfolio much more suburban than urban on what we do on the commercial deferrals we have million in commercial deferrals of that is current on interest only a very small percent has principal deferrals so we dont expect any material migration into any further nonaccruals michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much for all your insights guys appreciate it michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven duong from rbc capital markets your line is now open steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steve go ahead steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just on the rate sensitivity just curious on the basis points of uptick in nii whats the beta assumption behind that is there a lag to the beta at all valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp steven its travis lan so no i mean thats an instantaneous shock and our assumption there is that all the brokered and cd stuff reprises at beta or beta of i guess and then the more transactionoriented accounts reprice with a beta between and basically so thats the assumption that gets baked in there steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp indiscernible you can see in our last q and youll see in our upcoming q in a couple of days right that the plus basis points in the last q changed nii by so i dont think any of this is directionally inconsistent with what you wouldve expected before steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes appreciate that thank you travis and then just on the valley pay app is that an app that you guys are developing inhouse or is this a white labeled app ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp its really i mean definitely i think you should be thinking of it more about a whole digital ph payment ecosystem steven as opposed to just what this individual app is its something weve been able to build internally with the partners obviously and working with partners as we continue to roll this out we do believe there is opportunity once again from a fee income perspective not just directly for this but from a fee income perspective as to how we think about working with other banks that do potentially look at getting into this business down the road steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it got it okay and then just maybe just one last one just on the nonaccruals if we go back in time your nonaccruals right now are basis points is there a kind of a level that you see that you guys are when would you not be comfortable with the nonaccrual levels thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp i think were confident that the nonaccrual levels should not migrate upwards from where they are and again we monitor watch closely maintain our underwriting standards in a very granular diverse portfolio michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and ill add to that real quickly that while im not going to give you a number because i think its market dependent and obviously depends upon the size of the portfolio as well i think the bigger issue here is these are still very low numbers on a relative basis and as you look backwards since you asked about looking backwards valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 if you look backwards youll notice that our loss history including nonaccruals migrating to loss is roughly half of what our peer group was so our credit quality we still feel very comfortable based upon the fact that thats been the history of what weve been able to put up steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc appreciate it thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken zerbe from morgan stanley your line is now open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning ken michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i will limit my questions out of respect for everyone else on the call but in terms of loan growth your comments about the high end of the midsingle digit guidance when you think about growth over the next months does it really come sort of more of the same i mean i was looking at slide like the nonowneroccupied cre auto so i guess thats the first part of the question and then just also what would it take to drive higher core ci balances thanks thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah hey its tom iadanza one thing ill point out here is that we had a increase in our ci commercial line commitments during the quarter what we dont have is yet utilization were really not going to benefit from that growth until the utilization returns to prepandemic norms so we are increasing ci customers the new hires that we onboarded they represented about of our quarterly production and of what they produced was cirelated so we are starting to see that and keep in mind previously weve put together a focused ci sales process that weve been running for a couple of years here now its got slowed down a bit during the pandemic but we are very focused on generating ci business were seeing it through the new hires were seeing it in our line commitment growth and ultimately were going to see it in the utilization ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 got it sorry and then the rest of the question just in terms of like other areas of growth thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp im sorry i didnt get that second part ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry the first part of my question was just and i appreciate your comment on ci my point was in terms of the other areas of growth thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah i got it yeah i think youre going to see consistent in those same buckets youre seeing growth in that owneroccupied real estate which is really cirelated that represent probably of our production during the quarter we have expanded into pennsylvania nashville atlanta were seeing strong growth in pipelines and production in each of those markets and ill just remind people its a very methodical approach to how we enter theyre contiguous to offices we presently have we go in there first with customers understand the market and then we add local lenders and leadership in that market to grow it further youre starting to see traction there pipeline in pennsylvania alone is almost million in the nashville atlanta its in that million range and weve already produced and closed loans in each of those markets so youll continue to see that thats going to be primarily real estate related we continue through these new hires to focus on ci were seeing their production increase quarterto quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp and just i guess you asked also about the consumer piece strong pipeline still in the resi side we are experiencing what we had reported last quarter a reduction in the auto side mostly due to supply chain and were seeing a strong migration on the resi purchase piece down in florida which now represents of our production up from ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you perfect operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew breese from stephens inc your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 good morning ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey first going back to expenses you mentioned million to million for the fourth quarter is that all in or excluding amortization ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp excluding the tax credit amortization that we typically back out ph for the adjusted expenses so if you look at our adjusted expenses this quarter the million we think its kind of right in the middle of what that range we laid out for the fourth quarter would be because dont forget in the fourth quarter were also going to have some impact on top of that from westchester which we expect to close on december and there will be obviously noise related to merger charges on both transactions matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then you mentioned also that we should expect some fluctuation in consultantrelated expenses is there a band of fluctuation you can share with us that we should just be aware of and grow accustomed to at least in the near term michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp no theres not a band but this kind of follows investments right mostly around technology so when theres a rampup you have an increase in that honestly the reason theyre not called off or called out on slide is individually any one of them isnt material from a gaap perspective collectively maybe theyre not quite material but theyre getting there and that expense is going to move up and down based upon the various needs that we have in the various technology projects that we have so its very difficult for us to look several quarters into the future and say with certainty what those expenses will be ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp and maybe i can just add a little bit on top of that too if you back out the merger and the litigation reserve from that professional fee line matt there was about a million increase quarteroverquarter about million of that was on the legal side and the other million were in the consulting side and there were a couple of consultants in there that would not recur in the fourth quarter but its not to say that we wouldnt have other costs to kind of backfill it so thats why we say fluctuate if that makes sense matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful thank you and then last one for me you mentioned expanding it to philadelphia that totally makes sense given geography but you also mentioned nashville and atlanta which are new markets to me i valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 guess those are extensions of the birmingham presence you have could you just give us some update on infrastructure or personnel you have in nashville and atlanta perhaps some indication of what loans and deposits are there already thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure the nashville and atlanta yes there is an extension of our birmingham business and office we have a real estate team in birmingham we have a strong customer base that are doing business in both nashville and atlanta so our initial foray is following them into those markets just to give you kind of some numbers on it we have already closed about million of loans in those markets i mentioned the pipeline before of around million and in the last quarter we did about million of new loans in those markets so its going to be again a slower go to start utilizing the staff that we have in birmingham their customers to learn those markets and once were comfortable well move into those markets with staff in each of those cities matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp same way we did in philadelphia we started philadelphia following customers we now have a staff of four people based in philadelphia matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay thats all i had thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david chiaverini from wedbush securities your line is now open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask about fee income you mentioned about swap income was higher in the quarter i was curious about the outlook for the swap fees as well as commentary around mortgage banking and gain on sale thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah on the swap side even though its higher indiscernible relatively consistent except for one very large quarter we had last year we expect it to stay at that level for the fourth quarter and into the foreseeable future based on existing pipeline the same with the gain on sale we expect it to be in a similar level to what we reported in the third quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much operator thank you at this time im showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to ira robbins for closing remarks ira d robbins
