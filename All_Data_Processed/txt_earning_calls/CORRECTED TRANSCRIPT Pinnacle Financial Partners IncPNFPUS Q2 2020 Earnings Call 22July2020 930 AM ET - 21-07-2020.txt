and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you jimmy at the conclusion of our q1 conference call i tried to provide some guidance for what our focus would be going forward i indicated that we continue to manage those things that produce longterm shareholder value but would remain in a more defensive posture until we can see more clearly the depth and duration of the pandemic and its impacts specifically i indicated that we have increased liquidity in q1 and we continue to do so in q2 which we did however we are reviewing details of substantial liquidity build from both wholesale and client funding all obtained simply out of an abundance of caution given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic i indicated that you should expect us to continue building loan loss reserves in q2 which we did not to the extent we did in the first quarter but still a meaningful increase our allowance has moved from at yearend now to at june and excluding our ppp loans the allowance would be in regards to capital i indicated that while we did not intend to cut our dividend at this time we were still in a mode to increase capital which we did beyond suspending our share buyback and retaining the subdebt we had previously intended to redeem we sold preferred shares totaling approximately million increasing or topping off tier capital i also indicated that for the first time since the great recession we were slow on our planned levels of recruitment and hiring in an effort to avoid the expense build that goes with it which weve done our noninterest expense to asset ratio as we adjusted was which is the lowest i can recall in the history of the firm as i mentioned last quarter its inconceivable to me that in the final analysis will have been about what our earnings were in more likely it will ultimately be about how nimble we were in a relatively changing environment and how well will be our run rates for earnings in and so while were taking these major steps to bolster capital and liquidity and were scouring our loan book were slowing the recruitment to avoid the expense build its really our intent to execute on the fundamentals that we control and loans that produce long term shareholder value like lowering cost of funds obtaining floors on loans and the various core deposit initiatives that we have launched in order to better position ourselves for a return to more normal run rate as we go into looking at those fundamentals that typically produce longterm shareholder value q2 was an outstanding quarter loans and deposits were up meaningfully largely owing to ppp we saw an improvement in virtually all of our primary asset quality metrics although we recognized many of our lagging indicators we made substantial headway lowering our cost of deposits and obtaining rate floors on loans and we saw linkedquarter growth in revenue preprovision net revenues spread income and fee income as always we will review our standard dashboard to key success measures for our firm ill start with the gaap measures for the quarter but moving quickly to the nongaap measures because honestly for the most part these are what we manage to total revenues were up yearoveryear and linkedquarter of course as we adjusted fully diluted eps for the quarter was primarily impacted by the elevated provision harold will review that in detail in just a few minutes pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 and next to the eps chart you can see core preprovision net revenue was up linkedquarter and roughly yearoveryear a really important measure when considering our ability to build the run rates as i just mentioned earlier loan and deposit volumes were up meaningfully during the quarter in the case of core deposits it was our largest growth quarter ever no doubt ppp had a major impact on that but when we dig in we found that our ppp borrowers deposit balances grew roughly billion during the quarter which means absent that impact our core deposits grew north of billion the largest quarterly organic growth in core deposits ever as you recall weve placed considerable internal emphasis on core deposit acquisition going back into and modifying our incentives which i believe is also having an impact at this time of course loans grew up dramatically in the second quarter allinall almost exclusively to ppp i think there were at least two matters to note the first is id expect pure economic loan demand amongst small and midmarket businesses outside of ppp in the second quarter would have been near zero secondly in our case specifically we saw meaningful paydowns in commercialized credit after draws had swelled in the previous quarter likely indicating less requirement for businesses to finance working assets and less urgent needs to build and hold liquidity after that line paydown phenomenon loan growth would have been better than budgeted for us in the second quarter asset quality was strong even after the significant rerisk rating effort during the quarter both npas and classified assets moved lower and net chargeoffs were just basis points tim huestis will review all of that in greater detail shortly so thats a 30000foot summary of the quarter our growing balance sheet largely aided by ppp strong revenue growth wellmanaged expenses and solid asset quality metrics let me turn it over to harold to provide a little more color commentary on the quarter before tim huestis digs into the loan book and the loan portfolio review process we undertook during the quarter harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry and good morning everybody im going to talk more about ppp this quarter i think its important so you can better understand how we believe our second quarter results were impacted excluding ppp from our eop balances results in a million reduction in our loans for the quarter as terry mentioned in the last quarter we had about million in commercial line draw increases this quarter line draws were down by million line draws were at which is the lowest i can remember in recent memory loans are coming in at a slower pace but there are opportunities we still believe based on discussions with our market leaders and commercial lenders that annualized loan growth will land in the lowtomid single digits for this year of course after excluding the impact of ppp after looking forward were not anticipating any reduction in ppp loan balances in the third quarter that may be conservative but we dont have good forgiveness rules yet so thats the decision weve made for the third quarter the sba told congress that they hope to have their forgiveness portal up and running by august well just have to see average balances for ppp loans was billion in the second quarter our third quarter forecast for average ppp loans is slightly more than billion our yield on ppp loans was in the second quarter so third quarter should be fairly consistent based on our note paydown assumptions were forecasting principal reductions in ppp loans in the fourth quarter our internal forecast anticipate that of our million in ppp fees will amortize into income in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter given our guess that we will likely get meaningful ppp forgiveness in the fourth quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 as for deposits as terry mentioned there was a huge deposit quarter for us endofperiod deposits were up almost while core deposits were up over march significant growth in noninterestbearing deposits ending at billion theres a chart in the supplemental information that characterizes the second quarter growth for loans and deposits were estimating that the ppp program provided about billion of our deposit growth for the quarter this is a rough estimate because its practically impossible to determine a precise number that number is simply the net growth in ppp borrowers deposits between march and june we do anticipate that a meaningful amount of these deposits will move off of our balance sheet over the next few quarters as the ppp borrowers use those funds so rest of the same quarter growth was split billion in client growth and billion in wholesale deposits wholesale deposits were acquired as part of our decision to amp up our liquidity as a result of covid in all likelihood well see some of these wholesale deposits decrease in the third and fourth quarters so we intend to let our liquidity return to more traditional levels over the next months this is all contingent on covid and obviously progress toward a vaccine next is the usual update for our loan pricing given the circumstances very pleased with how loan spreads have held up when you consider the 30day libor averaged about in the first quarter and that fell to basis points in the same quarter and will likely be to basis points in the third quarter our relationship managers are working with borrowers to increase libor spreads and are finding success as noted on the slide our second quarter libor rates for new loans were at compared to for the entire libor portfolio primebased credit is hanging tough basically trying to keep a fore handle on these credits getting more and more successful in achieving loan floors on the prime and libor book so were excited to see that occurring more on that in a minute fixed rate lending is also hanging tough were giving us some yield on new fixed rate loans as new loans come in at around in the second quarter with the total fixed rate book yielding around forecasting loan yields in this environment is pretty difficult right now given the uncertainty around ppp loans we should experience some loan yield contraction in the third quarter given the impact of ppp and where libor is hovering offsetting these two items for us will be the success were having in loan books at june we had billion shorterterm variable rate credit with a loan floor and that number is up from billion at march we also have million in shorterterm variable rate credit that comes up further between now and yearend that doesnt have a loan floor yet one of the big opportunities we have as we work our way through is to build loan floors into our prime and libor loan books doing that will obviously help us as we ramp into in this lower for longer flatter yield curve im not going to spend a great deal of time discussing deposit pricing this is obviously not a new chart and it seems like deposit betas or so last year that said the other big thing we can do as we focus on building around into is managing our deposit in total funding costs we see no reason we should not be targeting a range of less than basis points to basis points for deposit cost by yearend pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 our relationship managers have their client list and are working with them aimed at depositors who have higher deposit pricing we have approximately billion in cd renewals in the second half of the year and we will be gradually reducing our wholesale funding balances both of which will serve to reduce funding costs now were bringing this information forward from last quarter im not going to spend a lot of time this quarter as much of the information weve already covered the nim chart on top left goes back to and tracks our nim in relation to fed funds target rates we all know weve operated in the zero rate environment before so here we go again hopefully it wont last for seven years like it did last time obviously loan floors are critical in this environment so we are pleased with where we are with the information on the bottom left chart as we mentioned in our press release last time we believe that both ppp and our excess liquidity negatively impacted our nim by basis points there was a slide in the supplemental information that shows how we calculated that number but suffice to say that these two events have impacted our reported net interest margin meaningfully looking to the third quarter were optimistic that the gaap margin will hold fairly steady and be somewhat dependent on our third quarter ppp results weve obviously have to counterpunch reduction in libor with the build in loan floors and reduce deposit pricing average liquidity hopefully will be down by modest amount in the third quarter so that too should be helpful now the fee income ill be really brief these were more than million for the quarter up slightly over the last quarter and the same quarter of last year taking bhg out of the calculation reflect significant growth as mortgage period today during the second quarter consistent with our financial institutions its been a huge refinance quarter and their pipelines are really strong currently but we are anticipating a repeat of q2 when weve underestimated results from this group before wealth management revenues were down this quarter from last quarter primarily based on advisory fees for investment services where fee revenues are received in arrears and are based on market performance we should see these revenues come back in the third quarter with a broader market rebound that has occurred bhg contributed approximately million which was slightly more than we anticipated but more on bhg in a second so now briefly on expenses personnel cost were down million from the prior quarter due to reduced incentives and reduced benefit cost we dont have an exact number for ppp over time cost but over time is up about this quarter over last quarter as to benefit cost several speculate that medical expenses are down due to elective procedures being sidelined or some portion of the quarter may be so consistent with prior years the usual reduction in payrolls and unemployment taxes also contributed to the reduced benefit cost as to covidrelated savings we anticipate around million to million in incentive savings for both cash and equity incentives as earnings were not being achieved through this year we probably have another million to million in savings from travel entertainment expense reimbursement and other things that i really havent thought about our cash incentive accrual is at at quarterend this resulted in million to million reduction in incentive costs this year as many of you know our annual cash incentive is based on eps targets and for this year we adopted deposit growth component into our incentive plan and that deposit component is driving the incentive accrual for our associates pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 with the additional provisioning this year our eps incentive target is likely to be doa absent some remarkable land between now and yearend we are working with our board to provide some additional opportunity for our associates so that we can keep them highly energized and motivated for ramp up operating performance of the firm going into were targeting an incremental of target incentives so in total call it of their annual incentive target inclusive of the deposit component we spent a lot of time on cecl last quarter so well be brief this time we anticipated last time that we would have another reserve build this quarter as terry mentioned our reserve without ppp loans is at up from last quarter we also increased our offbalance sheet reserve and as you probably know that million is in our noninterest expense line weve included some additional information regarding unemployment and gdp forecast as these are the two metrics that influence our cecl model build and promote unemployment being the most impactful you can see the weighted average unemployment rates in the green chart comparing last quarter to this quarter and compared to our rates that weve uses to at least one large cap firm that indiscernible very recently our weighted average rates are slightly lower than theirs but our weighted average rates were definitely higher so apples to apples last quarter we allocated more reserves as a result of unemployment rates and this quarter slightly less over and above all that we added another million into reserve through a qualitative overlay just looking at uncertainty and were having the depth and duration of the pandemic that exists at the i think were all in a weird spot every bank is working on their own portfolio in an effort to gain more visibility as the indiscernible there are just a lot that we dont know and its difficult to predict two uncertainties are that the us treasury will likely provide some amount of additional governmental assistance and loan deferrals will gradually work themselves through both of those we believe are positive the big negative is of course the depth and duration of the pandemic at pinnacle weve learned a lot about our borrowers over the last quarter and feel better about our book today while we obviously will know more at september with all steps that tims group is leading us through our best guess right now is that we will continue to build reserves in the second half of the year until visibility improves lastly this slide addresses what we think going into the third quarter no guarantees but were more optimistic about things in general than we were at the beginning of march that said loan growth is likely to be soft deposit growth is as strong as weve ever experienced its an awful rate environment were optimistic that we can increase core bank loans spreads and loan to deposit cost ppp will have a significant influence on our results for the next few quarters we have great confidence in bhg which i will discuss in a minute nonanticipating mortgage to set another record that they should have a solid third quarter expenses should be relatively stable still not willing to offer full year guidance due to covid and its impact on credit all things considered we feel confident ppnr will increase in the second half of the year now briefly about tangible equity our ratio dropped this quarter with the additional liquidity build and the ppp these are highquality assets that will eventually exit our balance sheet we believe we will manage back into the highs and low by yearend and into the first quarter of next year as bhg weve shown this slide before and its intended to give you a snapshot of bhgs business flows over time and more importantly how theyre holding up during the pandemic the green bars on the chart are our pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 originations and have ramped up with more loans being funded so business flows remained strong second quarter volumes were down slightly from the last quarter but this is our record first quarter the blue bars are the loans on which gain on sales has been recorded as these loans were sold to downstream banks this is the traditional bhg model with the annual sale revenues being generated the blue bar did hit a record placement in the second quarter as the auction platform remained in great shape and bankers remain excited to purchase the bhg paper the gold bars represent loans held by bhg on its balance sheet for which bhg will collect interest income they were warehousing more loans on their balance sheet than they ever have and with the first securitization of that to occur the gold bar should back up some next quarter so from business loans business flows remained incredibly healthy while the originations remained strong loan sales were at record levels and bhg is prepared to execute on its first securitization within the next few weeks on the top left chart weve shown on several occasions the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily in first in the last few years but particularly in they continue to refine their core products and increase the quality of the borrowing base and again the right chart and i will reiterate maybe the most powerful chart i have to offer related to bhgs steadily improving credit quality looking at losses by vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination thus pointing for the lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans pandemicrelated events will likely cause these loans to move upward but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and is much higher than the borrowers from just a few years ago and i believe has helped investors better evaluate the opportunities with respect to participating in their upcoming securitization and so our deferrals as of june total deferrals represented about of the total book up from this time last quarter then its continued to lead the group as expected with a deferral rate bhg communicates with these borrowers frequently and love to see these numbers decrease meaningfully in the third quarter as deferral request are essentially nonexistent currently weve updated the historical chargeoff and reserve builds these are the loans that bhg has sold for a net worth of indiscernible the green bar shows that currently theyve got almost billion in credit with banks that require their loans the orange line shows the annual loss rate while the blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks where the first three months of losses were running at about and picked up only slightly to for the six months ended june they have increased their recourse accrual again from last quarter to this quarter we anticipate some additional billing in this reserve going into second half of lastly we believe its been a big year for bhg and we anticipate big things for the rest of this year during the quarter the credit markets improved to allow bhg the opportunity to execute on their first securitization we at pinnacle were successful in accessing the credit markets with the million preferred issuance in june we and bhg believe that their securitization will be successful and will get them in good spot to potentially execute on the nonsecured relation in the next six months or so this allows bhg to continue to diversify its revenue stream away from getting all sales in the interest income and provide another very competitively priced funding source more to come on this in the third quarter lastly as indicated on the slide fortune announced bhg as best place to work in the state of new york they were number last year so it feels good to be number one congratulations to bhg on hitting that mark so here pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 was a sleepy little upstate new york company that three friends started years ago they turned it into a plus associates driven firm that is now the best place to work in the state of new york i suppose many are trying to replicate what they have build but there is a special sauce at bhg we are bhgs biggest clients and are excited about the future of our partnership and with that ill turn it over to tim to talk about credit timothy h huestis chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you harold good morning everyone from a credit perspective second quarter was the continuation of prior quarters for metrics such as past due loans nonperforming assets classified assets and net chargeoffs we acknowledge covids full impact on the economy and our clients are still unfolding but these standard measures of loan quality continue to hold up well before i go into our credit slides i wanted to outline our loan regrading work during the second quarter because our indepth credit reviews maybe more than many of our peers during the second quarter we rerisk graded all loans greater than million with a payment deferral in every hotel loan and every preretail loan greater than million our regrading effort was done at the loan level not from a top of the house portfolio approach our method was interaction with each borrower one borrower at a time weve re graded approximately loans our regrading process entails collecting current monthly borrower financial statements or monthly property operating statements current personal financial statements liquidity verification contingent liability statements are a guarantors we believe collecting interim financial statements throughout will provide us with the baseline given that borrower yearend financial statement may not be indicative in assessing their current financial health for ci loans we deployed a survey questionnaire to gather feedback regarding key variables such as revenue forecast for second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter compared with the same period in client ability to resume regular payments by the second third and fourth quarter a question regarding months of operating liquidity on hand and finally supply line disruption our bankers would discuss each question with our clients and then record the client response using an online tool that enabled easy data aggregation our goal during the second quarter was to identify and recognize those borrowers who warranted a nonpass risk grade of criticized or classified we did have an increase in the criticized risk grade during second quarter that is largely attributed to our hospitality book we have moved approximately of the hotel loan balances into the criticized risk grade category in our regrading work we placed significant waiving on the hotel industry given its known challenges that said fortunately of our hotel loans were in the economy extended stay or limited service sector by midjune many of our clients in these sectors had occupancy rates in the upper many of these clients can cover interest expense at a mid50 occupancy but with the anticipated recovery period of the hotel industry now less clear we believe this conservative risk grade stance is appropriate pinnacles risk grading process is fluid and should the hospitality sector improve later this year or into we will revisit the criticized classification of this portfolio our second largest increase in criticized was cre retail but its total was modest and only represented of the cre retail loan balances we acknowledge retail as an impacted sector but it will take time for the full impact of covid on retail to be understood the remaining increase in criticized loans was both modest and very granular spread across many different sectors on a very positive note after concluding our very thorough second quarter review of all deferrals greater than million and reviewing all hotel loans and all cre retail loans greater than million our classified assets at june decreased million from first quarter further our npas decreased by million from march to june pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 for our ci clients with a loan payment deferral we conducted a sevenquestion survey during late may and end of june our survey tool aided us as a qualitative overlay in risk grading our clients we surveyed businesses representing approximately billion in loan balances the results were guardedly optimistic threequarters of declines responded by fourth quarter their top line revenue would be between and of the same quarter in threequarters of declines responded that by third quarter their cash flow would be sufficient to resume debt payments as originally agreed of the clients reported seven months or more of liquidity to cover operating costs and only recorded a material supply chain disruption pinnacle continues its approach of a wellbalanced and granular portfolio while our second quarter credit metrics likely dont yet evidence the full impact of covid on our loan portfolio we understand that as physical stimulus and ppp proceeds are extended absent further stimulus we may see these credit metrics change as harold has elaborated our provisioning is largely driven by economic forecast for unemployment and gdp and as such we have meaningfully increased our credit loss reserve over the last two quarters pinnacle adopted a defensive strategy during the second quarter and we will regrade most of the remaining portion of our loan portfolio at the loan level during the third quarter our emphasis will continue to be on borrowers in highly impacted industries our goal is to quickly identify those borrowers who have been meaningfully impacted and bring the appropriate resources of the bank for resolution while there is an opportunity to rehabilitate the credit and assess and improve our collaterals pinnacle began proactively reaching out to the clients with loan payment deferrals during the third week of march we believe many of our clients accepted our payment deferral offer because the impact of covid was unknown this chart illustrates that our deferrals have dropped by of the peak this large decline was confirmed by our bankers talking to clients about their intention for a second deferral for our consumer loan portfolio with deferrals we conducted a survey in june with clients and the results were encouraging with a response rate we identified only million in an elevated risk category and of these loans all but four were secured by real estate additionally of our consumer loans that received a deferral are secured by real estate pinnacles consumer net charge off was for our small business loan portfolio we conducted a similar survey in june for of our small business loans we gathered responses on of the loans with deferrals and we identified only million in elevated risk and of that total are secured by real estate pinnacles approach to the hospitality sector has been a disciplined conservative approach of banking hotel sponsors who are wellcapitalized and have a long track record of successful operation many of these sponsors have been large pinnacle depositors a few attributes to illustrate our conservative hotel loan approach weighted average loantovalue weighted average debt service coverage of for stabilized properties of our loans have personal guarantees prior to covid we had only one nonperforming loan of just million this loan is an sba loan originated by a bank that bank of north carolina had acquired years ago while in most markets hotel occupancy numbers have rebounded from the lows seen in march and april we believe it is too soon to discern a sustainable trend where we are optimistic based upon the data we are collecting the most important attribute of our hotel book is that of our exposure is comprised of extended stay economy and limited service which are the segments that have experienced the greatest rebound in occupancy rates pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 the conservative ltv of of our hotels offers an opportunity to return to profitability at lower occupancy and adr they do not have to return to levels to be profitable pinnacle provided million in ppp loans to our hotel clients we have hotel loans under construction of which of the commitments have been funded to date limited extended stay economy constitutes of our hotel construction loans during the second quarter regrading effort we had just one loan of million located in myrtle beach moved into a classified loan status the ltv on that loan is out of pinnacles hotels only one is closed its a small hotel loan of just million in durham north carolina business center resort highend and airport properties are under the greatest amount of stress our exposure in these categories is limited to a few in business center and airport categories while the stress is not necessarily expected to be alleviated in the short run our borrowers have strong track records and the performance we believe positions them well for a recovery hotel deferrals decreased from the peak local and state laws in pandemic conditions continue to have a disparate impact on hospitality performance longterm we believe the states in which we have finance hotels are growth markets that will see stronger recoveries in the overall national economy of our hotels are within pinnacles footprint this slide provides some details on our loans in the restaurant sector it groups together exposure to real estate developers who lease the restaurants as well as loans directly to restaurant operators some noteworthy points include this segment is just of our loan book pinnacles very successful ppp program provided million in cushion to our clients in this segment loans with deferrals decreased meaningfully from the peak presently just of our loan balances have a loan payment deferral approximately half of our total exposure is real estate secured with a conservative ltv of of our exposure is within our footprint our largest nonowner occupied cre loans leased restaurants none have a payment deferral coupled with conservative ltvs our quick service segment is made up of names like taco bell sonic wendys and kfc our two largest restaurant operator exposures are wellknown public companies with various loan management teams we have only six restaurant operator exposures greater than million and four of the six do not have payment deferrals this slide provides some insight into our retail portfolio it consists of both retail store operators and commercial real estate loans leased to retail operators pinnacles very successful ppp program provided million of cushion to our clients loans with deferrals are now just of the total portfolio balances as of june our teams reviewed all loans over million secured by existing retail properties each propertys economics were marktomarket by underwriting current rent rolls identifying those tenants which had received rent relief over a defined period our preretail book is extremely granular with over loans averaging just million this slide provides some more insight into our retail book its a welldiversified portfolio with only of the top loans with payment deferrals we have no regional malls of our retail portfolio is groceryanchored shopping centers approximately of our cre loans are singletenant properties a very high percentage of those stores remained open as they generally house essential tenants such as tractor supply company dollar general oreilly auto parts 7eleven and walgreens theres been a lot of news coverage regarding bigname retailers like pier or bed bath beyond and other names that are struggling pinnacle bank has always maintained a very limited appetite for power retail centers pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 we only have five power retail centers in our entire portfolio with primary tenants like walmart harris teeter hobby lobby dicks sporting goods in our retail construction book only nine loans are greater than million for our cre retail construction book are builttosuit single tenant of our strip center construction loans of the space is preleased the average strip center is a small neighborhood center with the loan size of approximately million this slide provides some inside into our entertainment portfolio over of our entertainment exposure is in the music publishing space to finance the acquisition of song catalogs pinnacle bank has a financial advisor that specializes in this discipline his extensive experience and strong contacts have indiscernible this niche into a national indiscernible program each catalog of songs is made up of thousands of wellseasoned diversified songs that are stable from an earnings standpoint revenue from the catalog is generated primarily from music streaming fees paid from firms like spotify apple amazon and terrestrial radio to a lesser degree sync revenue is generated from songs in the catalog used in film tv commercials and general licensing country music streaming is up since the start of the pandemic in catalogs with seasoned older songs are also up materially as well sync has had some pressure but digital revenues are up largely offsetting other declines this asset class is largely considered an uncorrelated annuity and as such institutional investment in this space in recent years has been robust the loans have appropriate loan covenants that permit close monitoring average ltds are under pinnacles very successful ppp program provided million of cushions to our clients terry now ill turn it back over to you to talk about moving forward in this pandemic m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay thanks tim in last quarter call it was my objective to get everybody all know moving forward in this pandemic it was our intend to move from offense to defense to slower our investment and growth until the storm has been weathered and the environment is once again conducive to our unusual ability to attract talent and take share defense will continue to be our number one focus as we move into the second half weve elevated the liquidity meaningfully weve taken actions to preserve and increase capital weve built our allowance for credit loss substantially in the first two quarters and harold has already indicated indiscernible further elevation in the second half of this year as you already heard from tim we allocated enormous resource to the reriskgrading of the more difficult loans in our portfolio during the second quarter and its our intent to finish reriskgrading the rest of the graded loan portfolio during the third quarter that said i believe our aggressive addition to revenue producers over the last two years we were still in the early stages of consolidating their client base from where they were before to us should result ongoing growth albeit at a slower pace than what we would have been producing precovid as weve already discussed while we wont hire nearly as many as we had planned this year in order to contain expense growth we will continue to make important hires the truth is from a client perspective these are the times that firms like ours are able to clearly differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of how we value clients and consequently we expect to pick up important market share that fuels earnings growth that will come out other side of the economic slowdown pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 specifically we intend to maintain elevated levels of liquidity until we find a more certain economic footing right now as you heard harold say we intend to begin reducing some liquidity over the third and fourth quarters but ultimately well unwind the institutional portion of that and pick up that cost savings when its appropriate but ultimately well unwind the institutional portion of that and pick up that cost savings when its appropriate after our million preferred issuance we feel like were in great shape on capital and consequently dont anticipate any further capital actions at this time as ive mentioned before although we dont tend to cut our dividends this time were still in a capital preservation mode suspending our share buyback program and retaining the subdebt that we had previously intended to redeem so we expect in our primary mechanism for growing our capital position from this point forward is through retained earnings and hopefully our very strong pretax preprovision roa of demonstrates that well have the flexibility to do just that weve slowed our recruitment and hiring in an effort to avoid the expense bills and enable us to maximize pre provision net revenue as an important aspect of our defensive posture i want to be clear weve not frozen hiring completely weve just slowed it and of course relative to our plan well harvest a significant amount of the budgeted incentives that are tied to the eps targets which offers expense run rate in meaningfully so much of what weve been talking about is defense but one of the things that governs us during a time like this is the value that we place on our client relationships many of our competitors in the past have been viewed as reactionary and heavyhanded and consequently they have meaningfully damaged their reputations for valuing longterm relationships it would surprise me if it were different than that this time but following the great recession according to greenwich associates pinnacle had earned the best reputation in our markets for valuing longterm client relationships and that bond remains critical to us now on the bar chart on the left you can see that this is a time that not only you can indiscernible client loyalty but its a time you can make clients for life keep in mind i believe that greenwich is doing research for virtually all of the top banks in the country plus about more among all those banks and all those markets they are already finding that the differentiation that took place in the great recession is in fact taking place now how banks handle deferrals thus far in the pandemic makes a difference how banks manage the ppp process makes a difference and based on their extensive research with bank clients greenwich has recognized indiscernible very large group of banks for whom they do research is standing out on those variables that are important to clients and were thrilled to be one of them when you combine the longstanding relationship that weve built for valuing longterm client relationships with the fact that greenwich has found there has been much angst over the ppp process which has already eroded bank loyalty among businesses and their owners that of course provides a onceinageneration opportunity for market share takers like us to harvest a great deal of market share last quarter greenwich has already found that in companies with annual revenues between million and million intend to switch banks in market share is already up for grabs thats between two and three times the normal level and its still early in the crisis so even at this point in the crisis we believe things like our handling of deferrals and the ppp process are burnishing our reputation for valuing clients and it would be one of the primary beneficiaries of the market share movement that will inevitably occur and benefit as we come out the other side pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 jimmy well stop there and be glad to take questions question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for the details here this morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co im curious on the guidance around bhg it seems like it was intimated that revenues will be similar to but then looking at the one slide it also notes that yearoveryear earnings growth should be up so im wondering if that implies an extremely large and if so is that driven by the securitization or something else indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think will be similar to were not sure about right now and im trying to find that slide stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i think it was slide where it shows just bhg net earnings going up in harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats a range of earnings between like to maybe going up above stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay got it that makes okay thanks and then kind of thinking about the nim moving forward i mean obviously you noted the basis point of drag from liquidity and ppp loans but im wondering where you think whenever liquidity does normalize lets call sometime early for arguments sake where do you think the nim could normalize at that point in time is that kind of back north of harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 yeah we think so we think that demand will begin to increase back into the low call it second quarter of next year and at the same time the accretion from the bnc loans that we acquired will be trailing off to pretty much an insignificant amount stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great okay and then maybe just last thing for me obviously you guys noted that you will continue hiring you have slowed im just wondering if you can give some color as to where you are in the face of the atlanta plans relative to the rm target longer term and then you guys have never really been a indiscernible cutting expanses on a net basis more about investing for future growth but is there any likelihood in this environment we could see some sort of expense initiative thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc in the case of atlanta i would believe these numbers are roughly correct i think we ended the first quarter with about million in loan outstandings and nearly million in core deposits i would view that to be a successful and ahead of plan for what was effectively the first quarter operation there so we continue to be excited both about the recruiting pipeline of associates as well as the recruitment of clients it look like to me their pipelines are solid for another good quarter here in the third quarter i think as it relates to the expense initiatives i think your assumption is basically right our approach on the expense initiatives i would characterize more about trying to drive ppnr up now because thats how we fund a lot of stuff weve gotten funded and at this time we need to be on defense but i dont think you ought to expect us to have real meaningful expense initiatives where were going and making structural changes to the business stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thats very helpful thanks for the color guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 sticking with the margin and nii side you talked about the liquidity drawdown to that million should we assume sort of that billion of wholesale coming off call it million a quarter or is it not quite that linear harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well its definitely not linear jared but were anticipating about call it million between now and the end of the year granted thats about half of it between now and the next four quarters but its not exactly on straight line jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then on the floors that youre putting in can you give a little more detail around is that actually should we expect to see some loan yield pick up on those are those floors above where we are here or is that just more protection for the future harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were optimistic that we will get loan floors call it in the mid or on the libor based credit so were hopeful to get some accretion and yield on those particular loans but were also doing things with some borrowers to protect against negative rates so theres some of that going on as well jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just finally from me its great color that tim gave on credit could you give an update on how the nongraded credits are looking that small business pool what are you doing to reach out to those customers and how youre trying to evaluate those pools of loans timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thanks we did reach out to those clients im trying to find my exact note here i think we reached out and touched of our small business loans and the results were very encouraging i mean i realize its preliminary but out of those small business loans and a response rate of we only identified million that we would call elevated risk so that continues to be an area of focus for us but our survey results and this was done in midjune came back quite positive jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you very much timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc welcome harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jared pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 operator thank you our next question comes from catherine mealor with kbw your line is now open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one more on credit just to dig into the deferrals a little bit the reduction was really encouraging to see is there also a way to dissect that to look at what dollar number has asked for a second round of deferrals and then maybe the dollar amount that you expect to come up for to come off deferral over the next call it couple of months just so we can kind of the decline was great but just kind of think about how much of that is just from it running off and how much is actually were doing in a phase timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc jennifer i would tell you i mean catherine im sorry that decline was as of yesterday we all know we were doing deferrals in april midapril late april early may and that window will come open soon in talking with our fas we believe the declines will continue its hard for me to give you a hard number but i think that they will continue to decline based on conversations that our fas have had with clients about deferrals that hit that 90day window early august midaugust late august catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and how does the phase look like what are you doing differently with the modifications timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc when we rolled out our program it was a plus catherine so we would talk to that client before the first 90day period and if we felt and credit qualified them we would extend that second days using that same initial document that was executed i will tell you with any of the new deferrals and weve had just an inconsequential number since the 1st of june theyve just dropped off we are now asking for all the financial statements upfront before we make a decision so we can grade that credit right then on the spot catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 great okay great and then switching to bhg is there any color you can give on what gain on sale margins has done this quarter versus last or they are still staying steady or have you seen those pull back timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc no they were pretty steady for most of the quarter i think in june theyve fallen back about a half a percent or so but i dont think theyre not anticipating to see any kind of you know trend line lower than what theyve experienced for the first call it five months of the year catherine mealor a analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great great to hear all right great thank you timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator thank you our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks sticking with bhg i think that in the loss rate slide that you cover on for the loss rate stats cover on slide is very helpful where does that or what are you thinking in terms of where that peaks and when i know thats probably the hardest question but whats your read on where the things peak harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brock i think it is a great question youre right its an impossible one to answer but and im assuming youre talking about the orange line specifically brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so and they believe that its probably going to be in this kind of range somewhere in that neighborhood it could be more it could be less but right now the they grade the book every month so they are still hanging in there but obviously the deferral results will be very insightful indiscernible but currently they are not anticipating like a kind of number they are taking this more like another basis points or im sorry basis points call it basis points to basis points brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 okay and on the securitization i mean it looks like very bold timing here i would have thought you would get better execution if you had waited but at the same time very reassuring that you think you can get this done with bhg and is this going to be kind of a niche financing vehicle or is this really the wave of the future now bhg finances itself going forward longerterm m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think they will use it as part of their financing package last year when they had the analyst day i think they mentioned somewhere around indiscernible revenue split between gain on sale and interest income so it will take a few years to get to that but they intend to approach the markets in a really active way and i would guess that might be three times a year probably something like that so they want to get some experience with it and use that as a kind of a permanent tool in their tool box brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay its exciting lastly on the expenses if im doing the math right i would think that expense base is around ph annualizing the q4 is that kind of in straight from indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah the total expenses i think the guide was based on midsingledigit increase annualizing the q4 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i mentioned on the call that we may include another incentive component so your number we ought to come in within that number even with that additional incentive number so im not seeing ph but get above brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you very much good morning terry i wonder if you could talk about national tourism and how thats gone amid this pandemic and what kind of impact that has on the total national economy when its when its really good or when it may be struggling thanks pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i would jennifer i would carry it just anecdotally the count of people has rebounded some i will see them on the streets in the evening when i leave but its nowhere what it was precovid i think the spike in cases and the drop in tourism has been very noticeable and pronounced but ive been surprised jennifer with the number of people that have returned so i dont really have specific percentages or dollars for you just more perception of working downtown it is off and likely will remain so for a while m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jennifer i may add to that of course a lot of what drives tourism is music city center and they dont have any conventions and they dont anticipate any until so thats pretty meaningful indicator i think in terms of downtown hotels many are open but there are still a few that are closed or operating with limited service and so forth so clearly theres an impact i think tims point im not sure whether to describe it as fortunate or unfortunate but i do encounter more pedal taverns these days than they had over the last few months and so to tims point i think some of the tourism has rebounded but id classify in an early stage i wouldnt think we would in be at a midpoint of the return on the tourism in nashville obviously thats an impact i think you look at sort of the reopenings jennifer and nashville like every city and every state theres going to be phased reopening plan with stages of reopening we hoped by now wed be in the third phase but we were really backed up into the second phase of reopening because of the coronavirus cases have spiked like a lot other cities that are reopening and my belief is what were seeing there is the same thing were seeing in other markets where its concentrated in young people who are perhaps more fearless than a 65year old i dont know if thats helpful to you but jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc it is have you heard any anecdotes on corporate relocation pipelines for nashville or do you think that come to a bit of halt here with the crisis m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc my sense is that the corporate relocation pipeline is still full i dont recall any major announcement of late but i do believe that amazon announced in an addition to their office their opening their jobs that they were bringing they are adding another i dont know how many thousand jobs it is a big deal you know theres a theres one well theres a recent announcement you know what that was a no m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i cant remember either anyway jennifer it seems like to me that the development pipeline continues to be strong pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks so much m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steven good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc first regarding the additional potential incentive this year maybe to set up a stronger can you give more color on this and maybe what options youre looking at harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think were looking at probably a corporate ppnr measurement maybe trying to understand what we think looks like if we can get a indiscernible of loan growth continue to see strong deposit inflows what our fee businesses are driving or what we think will happen in and what do we need to do today and ramp into it so itll be along those kind of thought processes steve i dont know if thats helpful or not steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc but well probably likely exclude credit from it because its difficult to incent people around credit particularly in this we definitely want to be early in and early out so we want to get our loss content recognized as soon as possible and when you marry that up with some kind of incentive plan it becomes sometimes a little difficult m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 steven i might add to harolds comments so many of the key actions to be successful i think for us on the ppnr are really driving the cost funds lower faster and picking up right floors that are higher penetration those kinds of actions are the things that were trying to stimulate here steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and whats the timing that you think something like this could be rolled out harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so we think probably over the next couple of months we talked to our board about it i think we received favorable responses from them i think they understand the concept and the benefit that it could drive for shareholders so i think probably over the next couple of months steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then on credit it was nice to see the classified loans come down in the quarter what was the trend you saw in criticized and watch list in timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc on criticized we moved the bulk of the hotel book into the criticized size category that was about million so obviously the percentage of our loans for criticized this quarter had gone up significantly we did have some in our ci book and some in the cre retail but it was largely driven by our recognition of the distress of the hospitality sector steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then finally for terry you mentioned there is a good opportunity to take customers and it depends how peers handle deferrals ppp et cetera curious what are you seeing from regional bank peers are they struggling to offer ppp in these different programs and maybe if they are why is it technology or work from home or something else thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think what i guess steven id go ahead just in terms of our personal experience and then ill go back to the greenwich so i think in terms of our personal experience most of the big i shouldnt say most a number of the big banks within we compete they were not able to get their system up early it took them they were late days to get ppp system up to even accept applications i think they were very slow which of course everybody was slow but i think their ability to communicate to clients and keep them up to date on where they were in the process and all those kind of things was really deficient and so that was the experience that we saw and then to some maybe a little more reliable than just my own observation there i think in the case of greenwich theyve seen that there is a significant angst throughout the system as this tied the both deferrals and ppp where so my job is how you deal with the client as an example i think about what were doing to go out here and gather all this information conduct these surveys if you go out pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 there with a heavyhanded approach like a lot of those companies are prone to do you might achieve the same result but were out there trying to do it in a way that inspires confidence and make sure that they understand that this review is helpful for them and us not only as it help us to understand the risk but it puts us in a position to better take care of them if were in a position to document what their path forward is as the company reopens and so forth so anyways anecdotally we certainly saw it and it was tied to some measure to their ability to get their systems up and it was tied in some measure to just how they interface with clients and their inability to talk to clients and tell them where they were in process and so forth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery your line is now open brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just one question back to the deferrals maybe for tim just with the progress you guys have made already i guess tim what do you anticipate the deferrals end i guess october december kind of as you get through working through more of these and do more of the risk regrading and i guess is it a significantly lower level than were at today is that and then maybe who might be looking at the most at the request for second deferrals timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc the second deferrals have been hospitality and i see us doing a lot of regrading restructuring of the hospitality loans probably weve got a playbook written out for that so that everybody knows what were doing but i would see us restructuring many of the hospitality loans in the third quarter asking the client for help with perhaps pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 collateral guarantees for cash and under the cares act well restructure the loan and try and bridge until the property stabilizes in brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and how about i guess thats helpful thank you and then just maybe one for harold just on the expenses and terry just recruiting you guys have scaled back this year i guess do you anticipate theyre getting back to kind of a normal level as you look through next year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc its hard to know brian i dont mean to hedge on the question but i guess youd have to tell me where are we going to be on a vaccine where are we going to be on reopening the economy all those kind of things before i could give you an answer to the question i think we believe that by being semiactive which is as you know were still talking to prospects and so forth is that well be able to turn that switch pretty quickly but you know its more about finding a more certain footing and when we do then well be ready to go brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay all right and then just last one i think you guys gave some color or detail on the ppp forgiveness but just the percentage of loans you guys would expect to be forgiven today and just kind of i guess what were you anticipating in the fourth quarter on that component harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brian its somewhere around brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc indiscernible for fourth quarter and then total harold i guess your expectation is what percent of it gets forgiven harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc as far as whole thing over the next brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think we have about that goes out the full two years pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so in total okay thats all i had guys thanks so much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you and our last question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey thanks for taking the call just following up on the hotel deferrals so should we assume then that by the end of the year any of the more troubled portfolio or troubled properties has been restructured and ultimately come off as deferral or should we assume that some of those more troubled ones could be in deferral for a much longer period of time thats allowed under the cares act timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah what we will do in the third and it might some of them might spill into early fourth quarter is modify the loan not a deferral we will be looking at collateral guarantee so forth and asking their cooperation maybe theyre putting up cash for part of their deferral and with that modification under the cares act we dont have to flag it as a tdr so our goal will be to get all of the hotel loans that are showing signs of recovery modify it may be a modification that extends an interestonly period into and then resuming amortization mid to later but well be working that with each borrower onebyone based upon how their property is recovering jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so its current by the end of the year just maybe current under a new structure as opposed to deferring under the old structure timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc correct we will modify the loan before the yearend with the new repayment term jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator thank you and im showing no further questions in the queue at this time ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation on todays conference this does conclude your program and you may now disconnect pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected
