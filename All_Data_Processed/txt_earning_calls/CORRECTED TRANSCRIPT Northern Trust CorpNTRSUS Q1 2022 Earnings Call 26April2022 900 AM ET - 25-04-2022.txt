largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were up from last year and up sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the quarter up yearoveryear and up sequentially both the

down sequentially within this security commissions and trading income was up from the prior year and up sequentially other operating income totaled million and was down from one year ago and down sequentially the decrease compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the previously referenced million accounting reclassification the sequential decrease was primarily due to gains from property sales in the prior quarter the aforementioned accounting reclassification and lower distributions from investments and community development projects net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million and was up from one year ago and up sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment piece on page our newly named asset servicing business piece totaled million and were up yearoveryear and up sequentially custody and fund administration fees were million and up yearoveryear and down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by

to unfavorable markets and currency translation investment management fees in asset servicing of million were up yearoveryear and up sequentially their yearoveryear performance was primarily driven by new business the previously mentioned million accounting reclassification and favorable markets sequentially the increase was primarily due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and the

for asset servicing clients were trillion flat yearoveryear and down sequentially the sequential decline was driven by market declines and client flows securities lending fees were million up yearoveryear and flat sequentially average collateral levels were flat yearoveryear and down sequentially other trust fees were million up compared to the prior year and sequentially both the

waivers and new business within global family office the yearoveryear performance is driven by new business and favorable markets the sequential increase is mainly related to new business and lower

up versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year while loan balances averaged billion and were up compared to the prior year the net interest margin was in the

sequential performance was impacted by the accounting reclassification partially offset by lower business promotion expense turning to page our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach down from the prior quarters our tier leverage ratio was down from in the prior quarter an increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio was a primary factor in this quarters decline in capital ratios during the quarter we purchased  of common stock totaling million and we declared cash dividends of per share totaling million to common stockholders the current environment continue to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet profile to support our clients needs we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise theyve come to expect from us our focus remains on balancing a variety of factors in the months ahead with the prospect of continued higher interest rates benefiting our net interest income and inflationary pressures impacting our expense base as our trust fees are impacted by both quarter lag and month lag markets the negative markets in the first quarter will be more impactful for us in the second quarter we continue to be relentlessly focused on strengthening our competitive positioning within each of our businesses investing in our workforce and technology all while delivering attractive returns thank you again for participating in northern trust first quarter earnings conference call today mike mark lauren and i are happy to answer your questions jennifer would you please open the line question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question today comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i guess i wanted to just unpack a little bit the outlook that we should be thinking about with regard to the expenses i know that you have talked in the past about pressures on the business from inflation et cetera but this quarter came in really nicely and it seemed like there was quite a bit of expense management going on so i just wanted to get a sense of how youre thinking through that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 yeah let me start with the biggest volatility maybe and i think we should give some comments on the compensation line and then if its helpful to touch on one or two others i can so the biggest piece of the increase is obviously the retirement eligible equity incentives which as you know betsy its in first quarter that was just about million last year but it was around million this year so that increase was driven by higher levels of grants reflecting stronger relative performance but also the changes in retirement eligibility of staff who are actually receiving those grants thats an important distinction so if you take out that million seasonal increase that would imply that our comp run rate is flat from fourth quarter but there are some important puts and takes in there so first salaries were actually up million to million and thats a combination of some of the strategic hiring and the plan that we described to address the labor environment through some targeted offcycle base pay adjustments secondly that amount was offset by lower severance currency translation and some other small items that were favorable in this quarter so if you look forward on the comp line ill give you three nuggets one is we know that annual base pay adjustments are going to be up million that hits in second quarter instead of a more typical run rate for us which is about half that level two were still going to be doing some projected hiring and some other adjustments and that could cause an incremental million to million lift next quarter and then lastly just a reminder that as pretax income changes our underlying incentive levels are impacted and thats important to keep in mind just because of the potential increase in rates and that could have a meaningful impact pretax to drive that line so hopefully thats helpful on the comp line which i think had the biggest volatility betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay no thats great thank you and then just a follow up question on how we should be thinking about buybacks for the rest of the year weve got some market volatility obviously impacting aoci just thinking about whether or not as youre planning through the rest of this year does the aoci matter you obviously have still a very strong cet1 and tca to ta so so maybe the answer is no but given the back of ph win rates already qtodate it looks like were going to have another slug of this aoci hit in so how should we think through those dynamics jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah youre exactly right and even we were days or whatever into the quarter and were already close to were million plus in impact to aoci for second quarter and so we obviously have to keep line of sight on that now that said youre also right first of all we absorbed the aoci hit in the first quarter pretty well cet1 capitals was down just about the cet1 ratio stayed well under the and so we absorbed it well but you know that were going to keep an eye on what we look like relative to peers in terms of capital and what happens with aoci its a big lever and the quickest thing we can do to address that is making sure that were prudent about how we think about buybacks and thats one of the big pillars we look at as we think about capital action betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay just to make sure when you said you were million plus are you saying that if you had to close the book today your aoci hit would be million more than it was last quarter is that what you mean or less than northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp im sorry thanks for clarifying another million and its actually million betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh okay jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hit to capital just youve seen betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp obviously yeah incrementally taken what the yield curve is betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats where you would be today jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thats right thats what is based on what the yield curve has done just so far this year and thats as of last friday for what its worth betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure thanks betsy operator and our next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning alex northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning jason hey mike hope you guys are well so obviously lots of discussions around the trajectory of balance sheets in this rapidly changing market backdrop with interest rates picking up in qt relative to last cycle it looks like northerns balance sheet has increased materially more than it did in the last cycle and in last cycle deposits overall have actually hung in relatively well compared to the rest of the industry so maybe help us think through the latest thinking on both the mix of interest bearing to noninterest bearing deposits and kind of how thats going to evolve to your best kind of crystal ball capabilities and then ultimately the overall size of the balance sheet how you expect that to evolve with qt jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well on mix of the deposit and interest bearing and noninterest bearing i think the more important factor there is do we hold on to the operational deposits in the wealth space thats a big driver of value overall the way we think about it and so far we have not seen cash we havent seen deposits moving off the balance sheet however have to anticipate that thats going to come at some point given the fed actions and also just a rising yield curve where clients think about what their options are laddering out taking some duration and so thats super important for us we want to maintain those highquality deposits theres another group of thats more on the asset servicing or institutional side even within there there are some very high quality core deposits but some of the more sophisticated clients will move those dollars around and so thats just unpredictable what we have seen so far that has created more movement thats been meaningful is out of the money market funds and already weve seen and you can track this on our website and in the industry youve already seen clients in general and the industry moving out of money funds and whether theyre moving into ultrashort or other a little bit longer duration product or whether theyre moving into more risk assets is difficult to tell then on so thats a little bit on mix on size if you go back precrisis the balance sheet the deposit level was like billion billion and you look where it is on average now much much higher and so i think we have to predict its going to come down some but things are just different at this point and we anticipate that the balance sheet is going to hold in closer to these levels and not give up dramatically what we saw precrisis alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats helpful and then i guess following up along the same lines kind of reading between the lines your comment around wanting to hold on to some of these core deposits any thoughts around deposit betas and maybe how they may be similar or different versus what we saw in the last cycle jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah for us compared to last cycle when everyone was anticipating a move at that time and no one could really predict are we going to end it at or every move seemed like you wanted to make sure youre handling betas the right way because it might be the last move in this instance we know that were going to get rates moving a lot and so i think thats something to think about differently strategically we want to make sure again we hold on to deposits with our good clients particularly knowing that its going to take a while before the fed is done with these actions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 and so already and you saw we had very good results in terms of raising net interest margin even given the fact that the fed didnt move until very late in the quarter that said our bias is going to be hold on to client activity and hold on to client assets particularly given the fact we think its going to take a long time before things level out and the yield curve has reflected all the fed actions that theyre contemplating alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thanks alex operator and our next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey jason good morning guys so follow up on the nii discussion last quarter you gave us a rule of thumb on how much each hike would give you both in terms of a growth basis and then how the deposit cost would act out i was just wondering if you might be able to update us just given that so much has changed if thats still a net million for each million and just any general thoughts on how you would expect nii to ph traject from here given alexs points and just the magnitude of heights that are now expected thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well let me answer your question directly and ill give you some broader thoughts that you asked for so first of all the million we did say that was the first hike and on a run rate basis that played through well the good news is that even with that that contemplated just the short end the very short end of the curve moving up but the overall yield curve has moved up its not as helpful but youll get more lift as we get more as we get benefit from reinvestment so let me use that as a transition to your other question because youre right nii is certainly on a sharp trajectory so the eventual outcome is likely very dependent on the pace of change and again what the shape of the yield curve looks like so instead of giving an overall rule of thumb let me give you some of the key sensitivities so you can sharpen your estimates as the key factors develop so three big buckets on earning assets one on cash the key item to remember is only of those assets are in the us dollars sometimes people forget that and i think thats important to remember two securities portfolio a higher percentage are in us dollars but only resets in days or less so just over billion of the longterm securities are getting reinvested per quarter were currently experiencing about basis points of reinvestment benefit on that reinvestment tranche that translates to just over a couple of million dollars in lift quarterly for the longterm portfolio northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 and then third loans virtually all of that is usd and about three quarters is tied to shortterm floating rate indices and so i gave you some comments on the liability side but that breaks down earning assets in the three categories and so hopefully thats helpful in thinking through the math as different things happen across the yield curve ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah very much so thank you and just a follow up in terms of asset mix and growth just on the prior questions about capital the period end loans and securities were both down is that just a function of the deposits or is the change in capital causing you to change anything regards to where you want to see asset growth or securities portfolio duration et cetera jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah no headline is no change in philosophy and the way the balance sheet works from once the deposits come in inside the balance sheet the first determination is where do we need to hold cash across different central banks for various activities and then the second is what is loan demand and the third is therefore what do we do with the securities portfolio and so the loan demand is what really drives effectively in this environment the size of the securities portfolio you did see in this quarter what looks like a bigger move between cash and the securities portfolio but thats not strategic some of the investments we make are more just classified its more of a classification in that three category bucket between cash and securities but theres nothing happening strategically there ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thanks a lot jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning brennan adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc thank you good morning this is adam beatty in for brennan hi jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp oh hi adam northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc just wanted to drill in a little bit are you basically following on the discussion that we were just having around central bank deposits and kind of a need across different geographies to have those in place and kind of whats been driving that and then whats the outlook particularly on the nonus front in terms of potential interest rate increases thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure its driven by largely just the activity and predominantly the asset servicing business and so as we bring in deposits that are nonusd denominated we need to keep cash and liquidity on hand for matching purposes and then we might even have agreements with different central banks to make sure that weve got funds on deposit in those institutions and so the headline is its driven vastly by the mix of international business on the asset servicing side adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc does that change indiscernible sort of reverse in your experience jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp no it doesnt it doesnt have significant changes over time yeah adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc great and then if i could id just like to drill into the loans and particularly the yield on the loans you kind of alluded to the rates supporting that i was wondering if there was any change in the mix of the loan book that also contributed to the increased yield thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure no nothing no i mean you have seen over time some of the more of the residential portfolio coming down but overall mix is relatively stable overtime nothing that would have a meaningful impact on the net yield of the loan portfolio adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you appreciate that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jason can you give us kind of a rule of thumb obviously your assets under management in custody are skewed to equities and can you share with us is it primarily domestic us equities that is comprised in that number and second is there any a increase or decrease in equity values leased to an x percent or x percent decrease or increase in revenues in asset servicing jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure mark do you want to take it mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi gerard its mark so when youre looking at the investment management fees themselves its probably a pretty good balance between both we look at eafe local and sp just as guidelines eafe local just because that removes the currencies out of it when we do look at the equity market sensitivity just based on the asset allocation a little bit more than a third of the asset servicing investment management fees are equity market sensitive and those do happen both on a quarter lag as well as a month lag and then if you move up to the asset servicing custody and fund administration category of fees we said before about of those fees are not asset sensitive theyre based on transaction volumes or fixed fees or fund level fees the remaining though there is equity sensitivity there that too is quarter lag and month lag if you look at that line overall the custody and fund administration line i think million in fees about of that would be equity sensitive just based on how the current allocations are gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for those insights and then just as a follow up question obviously with the shortterm interest rates moving higher your money market mutual fund fee waivers will eventually go away and if the fed raises rates in may by basis points will they be eliminated by the end of the second quarter or whats the schedule there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp ironically we should split the waivers into two categories at this point one is what do waivers obtained as a result of interest rates forcing yields below stated fees that first hike in midmarch eliminated it absolutely eliminated those fees the waivers conversely the business has decided to keep some waivers in place some fee waivers in place for strategic reasons and thats adding up they wont do that perpetually but at least for the time being they think that thats important strategically again in the spirit of keep client assets and make sure that were attractive relative to our peers that currently is on a run rate of million to million a quarter and that will persist but again not perpetually northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and well hear next from jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hi jim james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey can you just maybe give us a sense of where you are durationwise in the securities portfolio as well as the balance sheet overall did it change at all did you shorten up or just where we are on that front jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so right now were at ph above and we were id say at the upper end of a range that we feel comfortable in and so if theres any bias it might be a little bit down but again the team looks very opportunistically whats available in the marketplace and where we see good value but right now ticked up to ph above just under that and then overall the balance sheet is the overall asset duration is ph james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities great okay thats helpful and just maybe a follow up on the custody and fund administration fees how much on a quarteroverquarter basis was the fx impact versus the volume impact because as you know that youve got a little bit of lift from the markets just trying to get a sense of those two other impacts and the magnitude mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and youre looking on a sequential basis james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities yeah sequentially northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp currency was not a lot it was a drag of call it a little under point jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp right right mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and you saw the transaction activity thats where there was more of a drag than from the currencies not on sequential basis jim james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities and is that just seasonal or do you think that that persist i mean obviously a year ago was pretty active mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah and we actually have seen sequentially for a few quarters now the transaction type of fees kind of declining so its actually been something that weve seen for the last three quarters i believe so its hard to say if that persists or not well have to see certainly there has been some pickup and at least what you would think as market activity in the last month or so so well also to see how that plays right james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay great thanks for taking my questions michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi if you could talk jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hello mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 hey good morning if you could talk more about this internal restructuring that formed the new asset servicing segment i assume thats to increase wallet share and market share with your institutional clients if you could verify that and also just by zip code if you dont have the exact number what kind of share do you have with these institutional clients now and this restructuring will kind of get you to what kind of targeted market share or something in the ballpark you have share looking to or going to and is my premise correct as to why you restructured michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp so mike its mike the primary reason for integrating those two parts of our company are to be more aligned with the clients and being able to provide better service for them so we really are trying to integrate everything from the front aspect of our business to client servicing part of it through operations and just the scale of our asset servicing business now is such that it made sense to integrate those parts of the business so thats the overall aspect of it or i should say objective is better client service i think that there are added benefits to it as well certainly from an efficiency perspective being more aligned and then to your point if we are effective in doing that should it increase our wallet share absolutely over time but i would think about wallet share a little bit differently in the sense that that can vary based on the type of client that we have so just a little bit of context there if you think about assetowner clients maybe start with the corporation that has a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan we may be the asset servicing provider to one or hopefully both of those and so by providing better service if its only one youre absolutely right the objective is to be able to do for both then we have examples of that in this recent quarter and then on the asset manager side there again its going to depend on the asset manager if you think of the largest asset managers in the marketplace we are a asset servicing provider to them to your point on wallet share it may be a minority proportion of their overall business on that front but given the magnitude of the size of the client it still can be a very attractive client for us and the reason why that works that way for those largest asset managers is one just the sheer magnitude of what theyre doing and the need they have they want to have diversification of providers youve certainly seen that in the marketplace but also they have many more different fund types theyre in more geographies and so they look to have bestinbreed if you will depending on the fund and the location and other factors now that said as you look at other large asset managers that are not the largest but say billion to billion in assets under management there were looking to have im going to call it a market share but essentially were looking to do everything from them front office through middle office and including back office or custody and so in those cases its critical since were their operational partner there that were able to provide seamless service for them and this integration between the ci business group that we had in global services into one unit enables us to do that better mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and aside benefit efficiency savings or not or is it really about the customer and share michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp definitely about the customer first my belief mike is that we will get efficiencies over time but just to be clear when we put these together and you can see in our results here it did not involve a reduction in force or a charge northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 or anything like that and thats because were looking at it to make the business stronger and provide better service not to try to cut parts of the operations out mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hey rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research im wondering if you could stick with fee revenues a little bit more and just talk about the organic growth trends both in the quarter and as you see them for the rest of the year in asset servicing and in wealth jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure lets start on asset servicing and first of all even though you saw not as strong of a lift relative to prior periods we did have positive new business in the period and if i kind of do a further doubleclick into what we talked about earlier new business was slightly positive im just talking sequentially market impact was a little bit of a lift and then to mark bettes point transaction volumes that was a big drag as we look forward we do see good one not funded business and the pipeline there is strong and so its above average for the business and so the nearterm looks positive and then you look a little bit further out its not as clear but the activity seems fine there as well if i switch down to wealth management youll see that the gfo business really stood out and ill unpack that a little bit if its helpful we saw just again sequentially a meaningful increase there about million or million million of that was from waivers but another million of that increase came from higher average balances particularly in the money market mutual fund space and the reason that i call out the money market mutual fund space is thats another area were coming and at the end of the year balances were quite high and because theyre in funds and those are daily charged fees we got the benefit of those funds sticking around the first couple of months of the quarter but as we look into second quarter the launch point is a little bit lower just a couple of million dollars but its just something thats noteworthy but overall you do see that family office northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 business is doing well and it is underlying good client activity or some of our strongest largest client choosing to do more with us and then if you look at the regions a similar story overall just not as large in terms of movements but positive from a net new business and flows perspective waivers helped there a little bit and markets helped and then the accounting change shows up a little bit as well and part of what youre seeing there and the regions not doing well day count had an impact in the regions of a few million dollars so they had to offset that coming from fourth to first quarter but again strong particularly in the family office business robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay and maybe just to follow up on that i think theres been some commentary and maybe an uptick in competitive intensity in the ultrahigh net worth space so maybe you could comment just broadly on the competitive intensity youre seeing in wealth generally but especially in that ultrahigh net worth or gfo type segment jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp mike do you want to start michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure youre absolutely right i mean its a high level of competition but thats what we look to differentiate ourselves from and as you heard in some of my opening comments there we really try to differentiate based on the advice that we provide the expertise that we have and then certainly the services and the performance that go around that and candidly the numbers are demonstrating that that does make a difference if i step back a little bit and just look at the environment weve been in for the last couple of years its been a strong environment healthy environment for wealth creation and particularly for that segment of the market so its a time period where youve seen a high level of sales of family businesses given the demand for that the high valuations concerns over changes in tax law so high level of activity and then i think were well positioned for that not only do we have relationships with families over time but also we have a very strong relationships with what we consider centers of influence so think about attorneys and bankers investment bankers that work with these families that weve been working with for long periods of time as well and a good portion of our new business comes from those relationships as well so its been a good environment we think we provide a differentiated proposition to those clients and prospects and its a competitive environment but one that again we think that we stand out favorably robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thats really helpful thank you both michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 operator and your next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions a couple firstly whats your expectation for deposit betas on operational versus nonoperational deposits as you look out over the first basis points and then the next basis points given that we may have a lot more rate hikes this time if you can parse that into the operational versus non operational jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp i dont know if wed want to try and cut it that finely and you can imagine there are some clients where portion of the deposits are crossover categories and so i think for us its just looking at what does the market give us and were not a price maker in the deposit side and this is very much working with clients and thinking about the relationship holistically there are oftentimes with large holistic relationships where thinking about deposit pricing can be something thats part of the overall narrative of and pricing around the relationship and so difficult to make highlevel comments about where our expectations are there vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay different topic you gave outlook for comp expenses any update on the nonexpense lines jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp on the michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp on the noncomp jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp noncomp expense lines do you mean vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats right thats right jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah i can give a couple comments on i think the big ones the equipment software and outside services so on outside services that came in lower than it was in fourth quarter and big drivers there consulting and legal but a lot of just consulting costs were lower and some of those matters matured more quickly but we may still get back to that fourth quarter run rate but more like the end of the year its hard to say at this point but we have northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 been able to get some of those more consultingrelated projects down and then also technology services costs were down despite the fact that market data costs were up because of good business activity so i think thats notable and then on equipment and software thats relatively flat from fourth quarter and so if we look at that sequential period no significant headlines its more driven by the timing of some of our anticipated spending however i will say that over the remainder of the year we can see depreciation coming in and thats going to start to hit we can see that from whats now already in the pipeline and that could accelerate and there could be another million a quarter starting in second quarter for the remainder of the year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and our next question comes from dean stephan with evercore isi jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning dean dean stephan q analyst evercore isi good morning this is dean on for glenn i just had a quick question around t1 it looks like the sec is looking to implement t1 by the end of next year so wondering if we could just get your thoughts on why this move might be harder versus prior settlement reductions any estimates around how much time and money itll cost you guys to get there and then i guess just broadly the positives and the negatives of shortening the settlement cycle thanks michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure a relatively technical question there and we can follow up ill say with the experts on some aspects of it but what i would say is weve been moving and i think the industry as well for some time period to shorter and shorter settlement times and that has actually i think been very beneficial to the industry to our clients and i view this as a continuation of that now where it ultimately ends as far as settlement dont know exactly and as you know it cuts across different markets and different types of securities but from a client service perspective and what we offer weve tried for some time period to be able to provide realtime information so even if the settlement may occur at t1 or t2 we have the ability to do it on a settlement basis but then also the ability to do it on a realtime basis in some circumstances or at least a t0 basis and so thats been the movement for some time period youre right it absolutely requires investment in technology changes in processes and controls to be able to do that but the direction of traffic has been that way for some time period and we think that will continue northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 dean stephan q analyst evercore isi got it thats all for me thanks jason j
