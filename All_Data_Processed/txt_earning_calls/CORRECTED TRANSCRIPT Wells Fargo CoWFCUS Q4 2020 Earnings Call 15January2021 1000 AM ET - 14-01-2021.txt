charlie scharf charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thank you john and good morning to everyone ill make some brief comments about the operating environment our fourth quarter results and ill discuss our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail before we both take your questions im going to start by making some brief comments about the economy based on what were seeing the benefits from both fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to provide important support for many and the additional billion stimulus is an important step in helping those who are still in need though there were solid economic growth in the fourth quarter we continued to see an uneven recovery and increases in covid cases towards the end of the quarter is negatively impacting the path to recovery overall our customers continue to be in much stronger position than we would have anticipated when this crisis began but unemployment levels remain high inventory levels remain lower than prepandemic levels and confidence to invest is dependent on an effective bridge until broadbased vaccination can be accomplished given this we expect will get off to a slow start but theres great potential in the second half of the year for a strong especially if there is another significant stimulus package before turning to our performance this quarter let me discuss our new business segments one of my early observations when i joined the company was that we were not managing the company at the level of granularity wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 necessary as a result weve made significant changes to the management structure most notably having more of our businesses report directly to me that change also drove us to completely alter our internal reporting to provide us with more transparency into our performance and underlying business drivers and give us the data necessary for us to create plans to improve our performance this is how we have now managed the company with reporting and reviews conducted at a business level at which decisions are made a big change from what had been the practice as you can now see weve also made meaningful changes to our external reporting with the goal of giving our investors a clear understanding of our results as well as the ability to compare our businesses on a more likefor like basis to competitors and track our performance as we do internally what you see now is what weve been reviewing internally our strengths and weaknesses should be clearer to you than ever but the potential for improvement should also be clearer the changes go well beyond the addition of business segments weve reevaluated capital allocation how we do funds transfer pricing as well as our internal expense and revenue allocations weve also added more detailed revenue and performance metric disclosures to help you have more transparency into our results we think these disclosures are an important step forward in showing you the size and scope of our businesses as well as forming the basis for how we talk about them going forward we hope you find it helpful as you evaluate our results and our potential im going to let mike take you through the results of the fourth quarter in detail but they continue to be affected by the ongoing impact of covid as well as our actions to improve performance and put our past issues behind us while rates have begun to move upward the overall level and shape of the yield curve continued to be a significant drag on our net interest income and for now we have limited flexibility to offset these headwinds with balance sheet growth given our constraints of operating under an asset cap in terms of major business trends corporate loan demand remains soft driven by continued strong capital markets conditions and an improving but still uncertain economic backdrop credit continues to perform well as both consumers and companies have benefited from accommodations ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus and an improving economic outlook actual chargeoff rates are at multiyear lows but again the ultimate timing and magnitude of losses depends on the broader recovery on consumer spending were seeing a continuation of the trend observed in the second half of the year debit spend is up double digits while credit volumes have largely stabilized at flat to down lowsingle digits compared to the prior year recently weve seen the impact of the new stimulus with roughly half of the dollars that were deposited into accounts being spent all in all our returns remain significantly below where they should be or what this organization is capable of but we are taking significant actions our agenda is clear and were making progress though it will take some time our focuses is as follows number one building the right management team number two making progress on our risk and control buildout and satisfying our regulatory obligations number three put our significant historical issues including legal and customer remediations behind us number four reviewing our business exit activities that are noncore and focus our efforts on building our core scaled businesses and capitalizing on the power of an integrated wells fargo and lastly identifying and beginning to implement changes to make us a better run and more efficient company i will briefly cover each of these first on the management team weve transformed the team by elevating strong internal talent while bringing in people with the experience and skills necessary for our success our operating committee which are the senior most members of the company responsible for running it is an entirely new wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 management team over twothirds are new to the company or their role of the members other than myself ive hired nine leaders from outside the company four others are in different roles and four were relatively new to the company when i joined each member has expertise and experience in their area of responsibility and brings a diverse set of skills backgrounds tenures and perspectives to our discussions and decisions our broader group of senior leaders is also a new team nearly half of our top leaders are new to their role from the start of including over who are new to the organization regarding our risk and control buildout in we announced an enhanced corporate risk organizational structure to drive greater oversight of all risktaking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the company we made a number of important hires throughout the year in just the fourth quarter a new chief compliance officer and new chief risk officers in consumer and small business banking commercial banking and wealth management have joined the company these and the many other leaders that have joined the company in who have done similar work at other institutions have been critical to the early progress we are making as we announced last week the occ terminated a consent order related to the companys bank secrecy act antimoney laundering compliance program this is just one accomplishment for us but its evidence of the progress were making and our ability to build the right risk and control infrastructure and remediate our legacy issues however this is a multiyear journey progress may not be a straight line we still have significant work to do but we are diligently doing whats necessary issue by issue it will continue to be our top priority to dedicate all necessary resources and make meaningful progress on this critical work in addition to the continued investment were making to build out the risk and control infrastructure were also moving with urgency much more than had been done before i arrived to put our substantial legacy issues behind us this includes working through our legal and customer remediation matters which are almost entirely tied to our historical issues in doing this work were committed to treating customers fairly to provide some context this work is complex oftentimes involves going back many many years and looking across multiple platforms and systems weve also had new leaders come in this year and as a team weve been diligently working through issue by issue that requires this level of rigor weve made significant progress over the course of and its absolutely critical that we get this work done so we can do what is right for customers and move our organization forward over the past year ive discussed our businesses with an eye towards assessing strategic fit to the company assessing risk return profiles and creating a roadmap for improved operational and financial performance our goal is to be the preeminent provider of core financial services in the us and in doing so seek to reward all stakeholders including investors employees customers and the communities where we do business we believe our business model as a fully integrated us bank with significant scale and breadth of capabilities positions us to achieve our goal and that we are one of only a few who have this position but we do compete with thousands our strategy is about becoming even crisper about our target market and taking actions necessary to leverage our strong competitive position we are clear on who we are our core target market is us consumers and businesses of all sizes we do have capabilities outside the us but these activities are predominantly to support our core us customers with their global needs or are in domains where we have scale and expertise to compete locally we provide the same capabilities for both consumers and companies of all sizes while the words we use to describe what we do is sometimes different we are a trusted advisor and provide core banking services including deposits capital payments and investments wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 capital includes both private and public access to debt and equity our scale and sophistication allows us to have a differentiated fiscal presence and technology platform a few can compete with the importance of scale is clear and will continue to increase we have the right businesses at wells fargo to achieve our goal our individual businesses are strong and valuable we have excellent individual franchises that compare favorably to all competitors large and small we have the products services people and scale to be a leader in each and each has opportunities to serve customers more broadly and improve its own financial profile i wouldnt confuse our recent underperformance with our great franchise value and how our business fits together to put us in a great competitive position and then there is the great power of an integrated wells fargo while our businesses are strong individually they are even more powerful when working together though we talk about separate lines of business we operate as one company in our communities our branches serve our consumers and small businesses as well as commercial banking and corporate clients our ability to support our local communities is based on that breadth locally but also by the support and resources of wells fargo nationally at times our lines of business has served as artificial boundaries for us delivering the very best for our customers and clients were breaking down those barriers to more effectively serve our customers and each should add to our profitability and returns we have opportunities across our entire franchise but just a few examples include serving lowtomoderate income as well as more affluent consumers consistently across our platform payments and investment banking for our commercial clients weve completed the review of businesses and are taking action for those that arent core to our mission in the past few months weve announced sales or intention to exit the student loan business international wealth management and direct equipment finance in canada were also in the process of exploring options for asset management corporate trust and our rail portfolio as i said were focusing all of our efforts on our core scaled businesses and these other activities which may be good businesses are not consistent with the core strategic priorities i just outlined and were taking actions to run a better company which is far more efficient ive acknowledged many times that our returns are below where they should be and what this company can deliver i pointed out that our efficiency ratio is not competitive you can now see this by line of business as well and it is an important data point to guide us to drive efficiency and simplicity in how we manage the company as we do this we will reduce complexity and risk and our expenses should decrease even as we continue to reinvest in building our infrastructure and growing the company as we look at financial goals today were targeting our overall expense level and return on tangible common equity and just to be clear we will spend whatever is necessary to complete our risk and regulatory buildout we have started to take significant actions mike will share the details of our initiatives and our expense outlook but i would like to emphasize that we will continue to be cautious about putting firm time frames around our goals were making dramatic changes to put us in a position to capture our full potential but we do have constraints today that impact our ability in the shorter term to realize our earnings and return potential or commit to firm timelines we remain subject to an asset cap as part of our consent order with the federal reserve and we must prioritize balance sheet usage more so than if it was not a limitation a significant constraint especially given the current operating environment though we believe were making meaningful progress there is substantial work to do wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 were also temporarily limited in our ability to return capital to shareholders due to special restrictions placed on the largest banks by the federal reserve due to the uncertainties around covid as the path to economic recovery becomes clearer these restrictions should be lifted and we will be able to return excess capital to shareholders through a combination of higher dividends and share buybacks and the negative impact to our results from covid is clear and will likely continue until broadbased vaccinations allow for a clear and even economic recovery as these headwinds abate our earnings and returns should benefit materially were taking action for things in our control but will remain cautious until there is more clarity around when these constraints will recede that said were hopeful that our actions to increase efficiency in the company and the ability to return excess capital to our shareholders creates a clear path to a return on tangible common equity in excess of beyond that the ability to grow our balance sheet higher interest rates and executing on additional efficiency and growth initiatives presents a path to longerterm rotce of around again its hard to put specific time frames around these goals with any confidence today but were confident that our franchise is capable i mentioned we continue to have significant excess capital above our regulatory requirements last month the federal reserve authorized the nations largest banks to pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases in the first quarter that in aggregate do not exceed the amount equal to the average of the firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters based on this criteria we have the capacity to return approximately million in the first quarter this will mean the board declares a first quarter dividend consistent with the past two quarters under the federal reserves criteria we expect to have common stock repurchase capacity in the first quarter of approximately million including repurchases for employee compensation returning capital to shareholders remains a priority our board of directors has also approved an increase in our authority to repurchase common stock by an additional million shares bringing the total authorized amount to million shares in summary were taking meaningful actions and believe we have line of sight to a doubledigit rotce ratio while returning to lowdoubledigit rotce would mean an improvement from where we are operating today as i said before i continue to believe there is no structural reason why we shouldnt be able to generate comparable returns to our peers over the longer term and that continues to be the goal was certainly a challenging year for all but im proud of what wells fargo and my more than partners have done to support our customers our country and our communities weve begun a multiyear process of transforming wells fargo and i look forward to making more progress in i want to thank everyone at wells for what theyve done through an extremely difficult set of circumstances and i look forward to a better i will now turn the call over to mike michael santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone first id like to thank john shrewsberry for all his partnership over the last few months and wish him success in the future im going to review our fourth quarter results and then i will provide some information on our expectations on a few additional topics was a challenging year and im proud of the support we provided to our customers communities and employees which we highlight on slide we summarize our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter on slide net income for the quarter was billion or per common share our effective income tax rate was which was lower than we expected due to discrete tax benefits related to resolving wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 some legacy tax matters we expect our effective income tax rate for the full year of to be in the midsingle digits our fourth quarter results also included million in restructuring charges similar to the third quarter these charges included severance expense but the fourth quarter also included charges for software impairment and cost related to reducing our real estate footprint we also had a million reserve release due to the announcement that we were selling our student loan portfolio which is expected to close in the first half of this year finally we had million of customer remediation accruals primarily for a variety of historical matters down million from the third quarter our capital and liquidity remain strong our cet1 ratio increased to under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach our liquidity coverage ratio was we continue to have significant excess capital with billion over the regulatory minimum and we hope to return more to shareholders this year turning to credit quality on slide our net chargeoff ratio in the fourth quarter was basis points the lowest its been in a number of years and certainly better than what we would have predicted earlier in the year as weve previously mentioned although our customers seem to be in better shape than we would have forecasted the accommodations weve provided since the start of the pandemic are also helping to lay the recognition of the chargeoffs which is reflected in our allowance level nonperforming assets increased from the third quarter commercial nonaccrual loans increased million primarily due to a small number of commercial real estate exposures while there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding commercial real estate the performance has been better than expected as our customers are benefiting from low interest rates which is helping them preserve liquidity its also important to note that approximately of our commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and principal as of the end of the fourth quarter consumer nonaccrual loans increased million on higher consumer real estate and auto nonaccruals our allowance coverage ratio was unchanged versus the third quarter similar to the third quarter while observed performance was strong there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter just a reminder that the reserve release in the fourth quarter was almost entirely due to the announcement that we were selling the student loan portfolio as we show in slide the percentage of our consumer loan portfolio that remained in a covidrelated payment deferral as of the end of the fourth quarter decreased to with declines across all the portfolios we are no longer offering covidrelated deferrals except for home lending and new deferral requests are down significantly loans that have already exited deferral are performing better than we anticipated with over of the balances current as of the end of the year on slide we highlight loans and deposits our average loans declined for the second consecutive quarter and were down from a year ago the decline in commercial loans from the third quarter was driven by lower commercial and industrial loans as demand remained weak and line utilization continued to be very low amidst strong capital markets and soft economic background on the consumer side residential real estate loans declined as prepayment rates remained elevated lower consumer balances also reflected the transfer of student loans to heldforsale wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 we had strong deposit growth throughout the year with average consumer deposits up from a year ago however average deposits in the fourth quarter decreased modestly on a linked quarter basis driven by intentional runoff of certain deposits primarily in corporate treasury and corporate and investment banking reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap turning to net interest income on slide net interest income declined from a year ago as lower interest rates drove a repricing of the balance sheet the decline also reflected lower loan balances and investment securities as well as higher mortgagebacked security premium amortization net interest income declined modestly from the third quarter reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates which drove balance sheet repricing these declines were partially offset by higher investment securities and trading assets higher commercial loan fees higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results and lower mortgagebacked security premium amortization as a result our net interest margin was flat compared with the third quarter turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense was down from a year ago and from the third quarter the decline from the third quarter was driven by lower operating losses and declines in other non personnel expense including lower professional and outside service expense primarily due to efficiency initiatives implemented towards the end of the year these declines were partially offset by higher personnel expense driven primarily by the timing of incentive compensation expense our expenses in the fourth quarter also reflected the restructuring charges that i highlighted earlier on the call and as a reminder we typically see seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter turning to our business segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide net income increased versus both third quarter and fourth quarter as lower revenue was more than offset by lower expenses and a decline in the provision for credit losses home lending revenue of approximately billion declined from the third quarter as servicing income declined driven by msr valuation adjustments reflecting higher prepayments and increased servicing cost net interest income was down due to a decline in loan balances and lower interest rates and revenue also declined as lower mortgage originations were only partially offset by higher spreads versus the fourth quarter of home lending revenue was up slightly as higher net gains on mortgage originations were partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower balances loan balances and interest rates a decrease in gains on the sale of loan portfolios and lower servicing income credit card revenue increased from the third quarter driven by lower deferrals and seasonally higher spend average balances grew modestly from the third quarter but were down from a year ago as covidrelated headwinds persisted average deposits grew from a year ago reflecting covidrelated impacts including government stimulus programs this deposit growth represents longterm opportunities as we work to build on these important deposit relationships with new and existing customers turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from a year ago while retail originations increased correspondent originations declined from a year ago as we maintained margins in a more competitive market and suspended nonconforming correspondent originations earlier in auto originations declined from a year ago and were down from the third quarter our underwriting policies remain slightly more conservative than precovid levels turning to debit card both transactions and dollar volume increased linked quarter while purchase volume increased from a year ago transactions were down as customers made fewer purchases but spent more per transaction as a reminder debit card fees are based primarily on transaction volume not dollar volume wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 credit card pointofsale purchase volume has rebounded from second quarter lows and fourth quarter volume was up from the third quarter and relatively stable from a year ago commercial banking net income was up from the third quarter driven by decline in the provision for credit losses but was down versus the fourth quarter on lower revenue middle market banking revenue declined from the third quarter driven by lower net interest income due to lower loan balances and was down from a year ago primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates the lower interest rates had on what we earned on deposits and lower loan balances assetbased lending and leasing revenue grew from the third quarter driven by higher loan syndication fees and valuation gains on equity investments but was down from a year ago due to lower interest rates and loan balances noninterest expenses declined from the third quarter partially reflecting efforts to increase efficiency and client coverage and streamline the organization while overall head count was down weve hired more bankers in key markets to drive new business growth in our middle market business average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter with revolving credit line utilization at very low levels loan balances started to stabilize late in the fourth quarter but loan demand remains weak overall reflecting continued high liquidity levels strength in the capital markets and lower inventory levels turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue growth from the third quarter was driven by an increase in investment banking revenue on higher advisory fees and equity origination the investment banking pipeline remains strong at yearend commercial real estate revenue grew from the third quarter driven by higher cmbs volumes and improved gainonsale margins as well as an increase in lowincome housing tax credit income the growth in revenue from a year ago was primarily driven by our lowincome housing business which in the fourth quarter of included lower revenue due to the timing of expected tax benefit recognition markets revenue declined from the third quarter on trading volumes lower trading volumes across fixed income and equities overall was a good year with strong performance across fixed income and equities especially during the first half of the year however our results were impacted in part due to actions we took to reduce tradingrelated assets in order to manage under the asset cap noninterest expense declined from the third quarter primarily reflecting the timing of incentive compensation accruals and average deposits declined with average trading assets were down from a year ago primarily driven by actions weve taken to proactively manage deposits and other liabilities wealth and investment management net income increased from the third quarter driven by revenue growth primarily reflecting higher assetbased fees noninterest expense increased from the third quarter driven by higher revenuebased compensation versus the fourth quarter of net income increased reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income which was more than offset by lower expenses due to one time charges in average loans increased from a year ago with growth in both securitiesbased lending and nonconforming mortgages average deposits grew from a year ago and we ended the year with a record client assets of trillion up from a year ago wells fargo asset management assets under management of billion increased from a year ago due to net flows into money market funds and higher market valuations wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 corporate on slide includes corporate treasury and staff functions as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships and it also includes certain lines of business that weve determined are no longer consistent with our longterm strategic goals or have previously divested in the quarter this primarily includes our student loan business institutional retirement trust rail and our direct equipment finance business in canada turning now to our expectations for starting with net interest income on slide as a starting point if you were to annualize the fourth quarters net interest income you get approximately billion we currently expect fullyear net interest income to be flat to down from this level its important to note that approximately of the potential decline is driven by the announced sale of our student loan portfolio our assumptions to get to the top end of this range include interest rates that generally follow the implicit those that are implicit in the current forward curve it is worth noting that while the recent increase in rates is helpful rates remain below levels at which most of our portfolios originated and that results in some ongoing downward yield pressure as we reinvest cash we also assume stable total loan balances from the fourth quarter with a modest reduction in the proportion of consumer loan balances consistent with recent trends to achieve this we would need some improvement in loan demand which has been soft across the industry for the past couple quarters additionally mortgage balances will likely continue to see headwinds in given the elevated level of prepayments which have exceeded portfolio originations and given the expected sale or re securitization of loans previously purchased out of agency mortgage securitizations finally we assume stable to modestly improving credit spreads across major loans and securities categories recently we have seen significant tightening and most credit sensitive assets are now trading through the pre covid levels of early our net interest income expectations for also assume the asset capital will remain in place regarding the asset cap we are focused on getting the work done properly and believe were making progress however there remains a significant amount of work to do and a series of steps required by the consent order requiring both successful execution and implementation by us and ultimately a determination by the federal reserve as to when the work has been completed to their satisfaction recognizing we are early in the year and uncertainties exist the range we have provided reflects the continue for pressures on each of these assumptions turning to expenses on slide were focused on building a more efficient company with a streamlined organizational structure and less complexity so we can better serve our customers our efficiency initiatives are designed to improve staffing models reduce bureaucracy and lower reliance on expensive outside resources importantly were not seeking efficiencies related to the resources needed to complete our regulatory and control work and well continue to add if necessary we have rigorous reviews to help ensure that we have the required resources in place to complete this important work we are executing on a portfolio of over efficiency initiatives which we expect to span over the next three to four years they amount to over billion of identified potential gross saves that are concentrated in the five categories that we highlight on the slide in addition to these initiatives we have a long list of others that are in the process of being vetted while we are focused on becoming more efficient we will continue to invest in our risk and regulatory work as well as to support business growth and improve our products and services we are not foregoing opportunities with good returns to grow revenue even if they may increase expenses we are targeting net expense reductions each year and our restructuring charges become clear we will build our growth plans at and as we build our growth plans each year we will provide further details wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 we provide some selected details on our efficiency initiatives on slide and as you can see some of these initiatives are companywide while others are business specific as weve streamlined our organizational structure weve been able to reduce layers of management across businesses and functions which has increased the average span of control by approximately our flatter organizational structure has also given us the opportunity to reduce support function head count and reapply these savings into growth areas weve also had the opportunity to reduce our nonbranch real estate by using our space more efficiently we currently have approximately million square feet of real estate which we expect to reduce by to by the end of much of this reduction is due to our underutilization of the space precovid turning to some of the business specific opportunities as of yearend we had branches which is down from a peak of over in reflecting an acceleration of digital adoption and usage among our customers we closed branches in and expect to close approximately more this year we are also changing our branch staffing model to better reflect the activity that is occurring within the branches which is less transactional and resulted in an approximately reduction in branch staff in we will continue to adjust staffing in response to changing customer needs we have also identified opportunities in our home lending and auto businesses in the fourth quarter of home lendings retail applications were sourced through our online mortgage application tool and we expect to continue to improve our digital capabilities in the origination process which makes for a better customer experience and is expected to reduce expenses as the economic environment improves and the processes become more technologydriven we expect significant home lending servicing efficiencies over the next four years in our auto business were investing in our loan origination system and credit decision tools which we expect will increase decision automation to more than by up from in enhancing the company experience while improving controls we also have significant opportunities within commercial banking including changing how we serve our customers and optimizing operations and other backoffice teams which is expected to reduce head count and expenses this includes working to reduce the number of commercial banking and lending platforms by over and standardizing and automating customer onboarding which would reduce costs but more importantly improve the customer experience turning to our expense outlook on slide we reported billion of noninterest expense in included in that were billion of customer remediation accruals and billion of restructuring charges so a good starting point for discussion of expenses is approximately billion if market levels remain strong we expect to see an increase in revenuerelated compensation of approximately million in primarily in wealth management this impact may increase if markets or business performance exceeds our expectations we expect to realize billion of gross expense reductions in this will be partially offset by incremental spending in a few important areas including personnel and technology including investments in risk and regulatory work after factoring in incremental spending our net reduction for is expected to be approximately billion with reductions accelerating through the year our full year expenses excluding restructuring charges and business exits are expected to be approximately billion with lower annualized expenses towards the end of the year in prior expense outlooks we assumed million of annual operating losses which is still the normal amount of losses we have for theft and fraud related items however we also typically have some level of customer remediation accruals and litigation costs which are hard to predict but weve assumed approximately billion for total operating losses in our outlook while we made significant progress on working through our legacy issues we still have significant outstanding litigation and regulatory issues that can be unpredictable wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 the restructuring charges we took in reflect what we believe will be needed for head count reductions while we havent included any restructuring charges in our outlook we may have some smaller amounts primarily real estate related and we will evaluate later this year the need for additional severance andor restructuring charges for initiatives in with a focus on ensuring the payback periods continue to be strong we will call out these charges as appropriate as we move through the year we made significant progress in in identifying efficiency opportunities across our businesses and we started executing on these initiatives resulting in the restructuring charges during the second half of the year this is just the beginning of a multiyear process and our ultimate goal is to improve our efficiency while continuing to invest in our businesses now in slide weve finished our business reviews and weve updated you on our expense expectations now lets turn to what we as a management team are ultimately focused on improving our returns we believe we have a clear line of sight to increase our return on tangible common equity to approximately in the short term if we continue to reduce expenses and we are able to optimize our capital levels closer to our internal target after that we believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors including moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve our ongoing progress or incremental efficiency initiatives a small impact from returns on growthrelated investments in our businesses and continued execution on our risk regulatory and controls work the combination of these factors we believe would take our return on tangible common equity from approximately the to approximately over time to be clear this is a multiyear process dependent on the path of the economic recovery and requires successful execution on our part particularly in controlling expenses as well as an improved operating environment but the takeaway is that we believe our business model is capable of producing these returns we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research mike if i could ask about the expense line on page is the right way to look at it that youve said youve identified over billion of gross saving opportunities and youre realizing you expect to realize billion of that billion or so in michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey john thanks for the question yeah at this point thats where we are weve got probably a little over billion that were sort of working on as we speak and well get billion in the year and as i said in the commentary those savings get bigger as you go throughout the year so that implies there that the exit rate is better than the john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and if you think about the gross to net youre realizing billion of net saves for like billion of gross maybe of the billion youre achieving is that ratio of gross to net could that improve in the out years based on what your investment spend forecast is michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah you have to sort of think about it that you dont get the benefit all in day one these things sort of take get executed throughout the year so that ratio of billion to billion you cant really look at it or im sorry the ratio of billion to the sort of net that youre seeing you sort of have to look at that over a coupleyear period as you get the full annualized benefits of the saves coming into the pl charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co john this is charlie how you doing wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi charlie charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co ill just add to that in the billion of investments thats broken out on slide that does include a significant continued increase in expenses related to the risk and infrastructure buildout that we have and so as we continue to move forward theres a point at which that the increase certainly slows john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research gotcha okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc couple of questions one charlie you walked through the businesses that you have sold or are in the process of contemplating selling should we take that to mean that thats the full extent of what youre looking to do with the business model at this stage and that theres anything else beyond those areas are not being contemplated for sale or maybe just give us some color on that and then how you identified what to keep like what was the bar for sale versus retain charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure yeah i think the answer is yes you should look at this as the complete list with the one aside that all companies should always relook at this on a regular basis to make sure that whatever assumptions youve made are accurate but we have gone through an exhaustive review of everything that we do business by business at a level of detail well beyond the level that we report publicly weve come up with these activities weve thought about a whole bunch of other things and so this is the list that were actively working on and we feel very good about everything else as we think about the lens that we used it starts with we look at the core customer base that we want to serve and is it part of our capabilities that we have either targeted towards that customer base or are they part of a package thats logically offered to customers as one also look at risk returns weve just made the comment on risk returns because ive heard people talk about this a little bit were not looking at the risk return of a given wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 quarter were looking at the risk return over a much longer lifecycle of these businesses and so you add that together and the businesses that were exiting theyre perfectly good businesses and the things that were thinking about theres certainly the question is are they best housed within wells fargo and so we think the answer is probably best housed someplace else there are different ways to get there and different arrangements that we can have with folks in terms of what that means but again i do feel very good at this point that weve looked across the enterprise betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and youve outlined where theres been a pullback in that loan balances or earning assets because of these exits but what do you do with that opportunity there i mean theres a lot of discussion as you well know about the asset cap and its hard to know when you get out of it but are you creating room for your core businesses to grow into that space or how are you thinking about that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so i guess i would start with we did not approach this exercise with we have to sell businesses to create room under the asset cap it was really the view was driven by what do we think actually belongs within wells fargo for the long term to the extent that it helps us with the asset cap thats certainly a benefit but that was not the lens with which we viewed this when you look at what weve done the education finance business is its roughly billion or so in assets of the things that weve announced that is the most significant piece and so sure theres no yeah that over time creates the ability for us to redeploy that capacity elsewhere betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just lastly on the tax rate i think you mentioned this year its going to be single digits can you speak to whats driving that and what your sustainable tax rate is and also is there a difference throughout the year like how that tax rate is it single digits throughout or is it just start super low and then goes up to normalized by help us think through the seasonality there michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey betsy its mike yeah it bumps around a little bit based on earnings and whats in the quarter but i think the simple way to think about why its lower than kind of the past is weve got a significant amount of investments that are multiyear investments in whether its lowincome housing other renewable energy that create tax credits and those tax credits are whats driving whats offsetting sort of the normal statutory tax rates that we have its no more complicated than that and so as youve seen over the last couple years those have increased a bit over time and so as we sort of look for look at thats the big driver indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the sustainability yeah go ahead sorry wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i was going to say so the dollar impact of those is up a little bit but obviously isnt much bigger impact on the rate when youre earning less betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so i mean as you earn more obviously your tax rate will bleed higher but for a good reason michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co correct charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys coming back to your slide just wondering i know that its a pass and its hypothetical and that longterm roe is a long ways away but on that interim stuff the do you have a way of helping us think about what type of timeframe might be possible to even get to that middle step that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think hey ken how are you so i think the way were trying to describe it is that is where we have clear line of sight so when we look at the impact of expenses these are actions that we are actively taking but were also in order to get to without any changes to the revenue equation at this point we also have optimized capital levels which means that the fed would have to relax restrictions and so the reason why were not talking about a timeframe is because we dont know when that will happen but the amount of excess capital that we have as you know is extraordinarily significant and were also in the position of not being able to use it because we have the balance sheet limit and so the timing is dependent on that but again in our minds very clear line of sight when that occurs to be able to get there in a relatively short timeframe wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 and then on the longerterm piece which you didnt ask about again there too i think there are some words off on the righthand side but again i would not describe this as a as just something that were dreaming about when we look at what is possible with modest balance sheet growth really moderate increases in the rate curve or steepening and efficiencies that we believe we can get we really do believe that that is what we will achieve its just were just not in a position to put a timing around it because we dont control the timing on most of those items ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood and charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co when those things become clear we should be in the position to be clear with you about timing ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yep and on a followup to the capital and then the potential business sales how do we get a sense of what earnings might potentially go away with those business sales and then if you were to get gains on those business sales is that capital also kind of contemplated in these roe improvements or would that be extra or incremental juice to at that point youre able to do something with the capital generated to offset some of the lost earnings michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think a couple things its mike ken thanks for the question i think well give you more detail as sort of we announce plans for each of the businesses but think of the revenue impacted by the four things charlie sort of outlined as very low single digits a few percent of revenue and well sort of give you more clarity as sort as they the plans come into focus with the timing and i think youre right as we if we book gains as we sort of divest of items thats helpful from a capital perspective that can either get redeployed in the business or through buyback capacity charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and this is charlie let me just add given what weve announced those are announced transactions not closed so itll take a period of time for these things to close so once you factor into certainly whatll impact its a smaller amount and were working hard at making sure that when we exit businesses we get the expenses out it obviously frees up capital that we have invested in those businesses as well as the gains and so you put those things together and thats why we dont think of the impact of these things as being material to either a plus or a minus on what it means for our ratios but it cleans up the company it gets us focused on making sure that were putting resources towards the right things and weve just got the company set up properly going forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks very much guys wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question on the nii guidance where are some of the assumptions informing the lower and upper bound of the guidance range for and maybe more specifically where are you reinvesting today versus the back book yield of basis points michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah hey steven its mike look i think as you sort of think about the top end of the range were assuming roughly the implied forward curve even though thats bumping around day by day week by week here over the last couple weeks so assume were not assuming much improvement from where it is relative to get to the top of the range were assuming loan balances are in total roughly flat well see some declines we think on the consumer side particularly in the mortgage book as we go into this year but we will and so well need to see a little bit of growth in the commercial and corporate side to get there and then were assuming spreads are about where they are relative to the other asset classes that we would invest in and then a very modest expansion of the securities portfolio but not very big so further steepening of the curve kind of increases overall sort of our positive relative to our assumptions i think the biggest sort of downside risk is what happens to loans loan growth particularly on the commercial and corporate side but a lot of the activity were seeing from stimulus and what the potential could be in terms of the recovery particularly in the latter part of the year should be constructive for that so i think its not a herculean task to sort of get to the top end of the range but it does require a little bit of growth from in the loan book from where we are today and then maybe just i guess related ill give you a little sense of how the mortgage market is sort of doing in the first quarter we are we did have the last couple quarters have been pretty strong for origination in the mortgage origination market and as we sort of see the first couple weeks of january its still pretty strong relative to both volume and margin on that balance so that should be also constructive as we sort of look into q1 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color mike and just for my followup on capital you mentioned that youre running with significant excess capital the strategic actions that have been outlined should significantly derisk the overall loan portfolio wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 and just given your strong ccar track record in the derisking efforts is there room to manage to a lower target versus the internal objective i know youre running above that it just feels like that might be a little bit too conservative given all the actions that youve taken michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean thats certainly something we think about a lot steve in terms of whats the optimal level to run i think publicly weve said its around and as you noted were running well above that target so thats something well keep in mind but as you know weve been restricted from returning a lot of that back to shareholders at this point and we always start the conversation first with ensuring that were allocating enough capital to grow the underlying businesses and invest in them with inside the company but and at this point were just restricted from returning so hopefully that will change over time charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and then this is charlie if i could just add when we think about the conservative capital position that we completely agree with and as we look at our performance over time as ccar does that does allow us to rethink about what youre talking about we also think about just the position that we have with our allowance for credit losses and so were seeing what everyone else is seeing which is that the performance is substantially better than we would have thought when we went into this and when a lot of those cecl reserves were established but weve also when asked weve been very clear in terms of what it takes to start to use that which is wed like to see something which we really do believe is more sustained and more equitable recovery because so many uncertainties exist so everything that we see is extremely positive but we think the right thing to do is to be prudent there and so overall the only really the only meaningful reserves that we reversed were because of the student loan sale which we had to do but that positions us from just a quality of balance sheet perspective even stronger going into steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great very helpful color thank you both for taking my questions charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question i guess i wanted to revert back to that billion plus of potential gross savings in that slide deck would you say are you guys kind of completely done with the reviews that got you to that billion number or to what extent are those ongoing i noticed one of the sub bullets talks about formalizing a program for additional feedback and i guess the context of the question is in the past you guys have noted that billion number as sort of a kind of a guidepost that would have gotten you toward peer wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 efficiency so just trying to sort of square the two together if billion is sort of all there is or if there is more as time unfolds charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure this is charlie thanks for the question i think were actually talking about slightly different things and so let me just try and walk through what i mean by that the billion that i referenced on the call was just the very simple math of our efficiency ratio versus our competitors to say that that is the difference in efficiency between with which we run the company and they run the company and when we look at what wells is we dont believe that theres any meaningful difference why that should be different that doesnt mean that were going to get to that number in a short period of time because these efficiencies take a long time to build in theyre based upon both expense levels but also the revenue levels that other people have and so that was what the math is but it certainly served as a guidepost for us to sit and say hey why are others where they are versus where we are and we didnt look at it just overall we looked at it by business and again as i mentioned in my comments now you got the ability to do more direct comparisons by business so you can see a little bit more of what we have seen so the billion reference is what we have are the list of initiatives that we have that are in progress of moving forward with as these slides mentioned it says there are and plus there really are a list of initiatives that we go through as an operating committee and each operating committee member is in the process of executing on which we believe we will be able to reduce on a gross basis the expense base by billion away from that were not done we still first of all its like peeling an onion back and so once you get a series of efficiencies it helps you look at everything else thats left as well and so were confident that there will be more after that which will help continue this multiyear drive to get to what we think is a reasonable efficiency level over a period of time to be comparable with our competitors first of all it took them years to get there and so thats why itll take us a fair amount of time as well well accomplish a lot of it through expenses but we certainly need higher net interest income and some growth in our noninterest income expenses would certainly be helpful there so i still think of efficiency as something longer term that as we focus on just getting the expenses out and focusing on returns our efficiency ratio will naturally become more competitive as opposed to a specific target in a specific year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay thats good context and i appreciate that and then separately just as it relates to the asset cap so under the new business line reporting a lot of this becomes a bit more selfevident so i appreciate that but just as you guys look at it on a daytoday basis what is the asset cap doing to your ability to retract and attain customers at this point i feel like all this excess liquidity in the form of deposits thats washed in the system over the past nine or ten months has just been such an embarrassment of money for the industry but unfortunately you guys have just a companyspecific hurdle in having to manage that dollar amount so as it relates to your sort of customer interface with existing ones and potential ones how is the cap impacting things at this point charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 yeah so let me start and then mike can certainly pick up i think first of all i think the way you asked the question is a good and interesting one and we need to separate the conversation about the asset cap between impact on our financial performance and impact on the franchise and theres no question that the impact on our financial performance is material in this environment right when you just look at well when we look at actions that weve had to take to prioritize balance sheet usage in an environment where certainly early on there were significant draws and then those receded with peoples ability to refinance elsewhere but deposit inflows or having to manage to those things certainly has been a cost to us and then i would certainly also add to that as we think about additional stimulus we need to create room on the balance sheet to be able to deal with that stimulus be it fiscal or monetary and so even versus where our balance sheet was running when we went into the pandemic just because of this environment we have to manage it lower in addition to the specific actions that weve had to take because of the requests that weve had both on the asset and the liability side for management of the balance sheet then we also think about when we went through the crisis the ability to add higheryielding assets when we were focused on staying below an asset cap is something that we were not able to do that others are able to do and then you look at our need not just to keep the balance sheet flat but to have it be incrementally lower to create the capacity versus others ability to increase it you add those things together and financially in this environment theres no doubt that it is a really meaningful drag on our ability to offset certainly nii in terms of franchise which is a separate question as weve gone through the exercise which we were doing daily and now we dont do as closely daily but we do do it regularly the conversation that we have is all around where can we make changes or create capacity which has the least franchise impact so if you look at what weve done were not limiting our consumer deposits and weve seen very very strong growth there we have pulled back on our nonconforming correspondence business for a period of time we think when we turn that back on if were the right provider at the right price then well be in the market for that certainly on our wholesale businesses theyve been more impacted by actions that weve taken i think on the commercial side weve tried to be very very smart and when i say we i mean the team there perry and the team we try to be very smart about operational versus nonoperational where our customers have other choices and they understand the position that were in and the same thing on the corporate investment banking side so thats just a very long way of saying i think that weve done a very good job of having as little franchise impact as possible hard to say nothing but i think the places that weve gone are places where people have the sophistication to understand why were doing we continue to do the other business with them and its something that we continue to obviously be really thoughtful about mike anything else youd add michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co no i think thats right and just you kind of underlined with what charlie said on the consumer side is that were not putting any kind of restrictions there and i think that were seeing almost a increase in deposit in consumer deposits and i think thats a good sign of how people feel about us and doing more with us and so i think thats encouraging to see on the consumer business r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect thank you very much for your thoughts i appreciate you guys taking the questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just two quick questions first one on the reserve i know you said the indiscernible reserve release related to student lending this quarter but i guess if you think about the reserve and where it stands as of year end i mean if we could equate that relative it seems like youre reserved for something worse than the base case i mean if you remove the base case in return to kind of a normal i mean how much is that implied for potential reserve release relative to what you had at year end michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i mean brian i think as you sort of think about the reserve levels i think for anybody given the way the accounting standard works youre not necessarily reserved just for base case right youre reserved for a whole number of scenarios that could potentially play out that are far worse potentially than a base case scenario and so thats kind of where we are today as you sort of look forward the i think as we sort of see the path of the recovery i think were hopeful that all the stimulus and support that the governments been putting in in its many different ways and the potential for more of that should help provide a good bridge to the other side but and as charlie said i think if thats the case i think were we feel that were very conservatively accrued for that kind of positive outcome but i think and well see how it plays out over the next couple quarters charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and the only thing i would add is just when you wind up quarter over quarter our allowance to loans is as a percentage basis is the same and we sit here today and we say the performance continues to be better than expected which would suggest we feel even better about the level of reserving but again were just given the unknowns we think its a good position to be in and a prudent thing to do but we certainly feel better off quarter by quarter brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just a separate question on those selected efficiency initiatives that you outlined on slide could you just kind of walk through which ones are the biggest impact to the overall expense savings i know you wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 had five different ones kind of summarized there but whats like the number one two with regards to potential expense saves thanks michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i would bring it back to page in the presentation and on the righthand side weve dimensioned the percentage that each of the categories contributes to the billion brian so i think that will probably give you a good sense of where the most impact is coming from and really the things that were doing across the company in terms of really streamlining the structure and finding ways to optimize are the biggest single piece but it impacts many of most groups across the company and then as you sort of look at the other categories its theyre somewhat comparable on a relative basis in terms of their contribution so you can see what that looks like operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys one nitpicky question and one bigger picture first on the nitpicky when we look at that path to the shortterm rotce using the fourth quarter as the base you obviously had very low tax rate i think its about and if we strip out the reserve release its about basis points chargeoffs so that kind of rotce in the shortterm whatever that is is that kind of dependent on still unusually low tax rate and reserve release or is that really driven by the incremental expenses beyond what youve laid out and obviously the capital too michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no its a good question look as we sort of look forward i think the as you think about the different components of what you walk through i think the as we said it for the tax rate is going to be sort of in mid singledigits and so you get a sense of how we think how sustainable that is for a little while and really the big drivers here though are going to be driving the expense down as we sort of outlined and really getting the annualized benefit from all the stuff were doing today and the stuff that it will have more impact in and then obviously weve got to get weve got to get the restrictions lifted on the buybacks so i wouldnt overindex on sort of the onetimers that you see in the quarter because the reserve releases are offset by some of the restructuring charges and other things that you sort of look that are embedded in that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and brian sorry matt i guess its charlie the only thing i would add to that michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co im sorry matt charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah sorry the only thing i would add is just being very practical about it is as mike said i think there are lots of pluses and minuses we could go through each of them and we do think it is a reasonable starting point but the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 thing i would add is we obviously at this point have really detailed plans as we look into by quarter and for the full year and do feel very good about that as a starting point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then the bigger picture question and theres probably no super tactful way to ask this but youve assumed at least here for the targets and guidance no lifting of the asset cap this year and it seemed like that was being telegraphed by some of the media articles in recent months but i guess if we do kind of look out a year from now and the asset cap hasnt been lifted would that be disappointing to you charlie and i appreciate that it will be a little over two years youve been here but at the same time it takes time to build a management team and theres been covid which your firm and the banks in general have done a lot of things for employees a lot of things for customers and that can be distracting so i know there are some puts and takes but a lot of us on kind of the investor and sell side obviously look at the asset cap being in place for quite some time and im sure youre impatient and were all impatient too so how would you feel a year from now if its still here charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah matt listen its a very very tactful way of asking the question of when we think the asset capital will be lifted which you know that im not in a position to answer and so i think your sentiments are right about what it takes it takes time it takes a management team i think what ill say if you look at the remarks that we made in the prepared part of the call the words are very carefully chosen and so we do believe that were making progress as i know even more broadly i feel great about the team we have in place our understanding of what has to get done for this consent order and for the others as i said i made the statement that i do believe that were making progress but if you look at the words that are required in the consent order theyre really clear which is execute and implement that and weve got significant work to do and i cant share with you i wish i understand why youre asking i said this last quarter too i really do i wish i could share with you the specifics of what the plan is i cant do that and ultimately its up to the frb anyway so really im just not in a position to put the timeframe around it other than i feel very confident that we know what has to get done and were moving forward and i wish i could be more specific than that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi charlie sorry to hop right back to the asset capital one more thing on that i wanted to see if you can let us know i know part of that process is the thirdparty review are you able to let us know if youre yet at that stage of the thirdparty review for the consent order that includes the asset cap charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i really cant again were not in a position because of csi to be able to talk about where we stand the progress where we are along that continuum again i just i wish i could say more i go back to the words i do believe that were making progress as i said its really clear what we have to do i think we have people that dont just understand what needs to be done but are capable of adopting and implementing which is whats required for the thirdparty review once the at the point of which the fed ultimately accepts the or just chooses to accept and thats really all i can say at this point john pancari q analyst evercore isi that is helpful all right thank you and then separately on the expense front the billion in cost saves does that already reflect the real estate rationalization the to reduction that you mentioned i know you cite it on the slide around the expense efforts but im not sure does it reflect that whole rationalization because thats a fairly substantial cut to your real estate footprint michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah the bulk of it is included in the billion number that we gave you so john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you one more thing on that regarding the cadence of the remaining billion of that billion beyond i know you indicated it would be over several years is that still going to be more frontend loaded meaning could the savings realized in be higher than what will be realized in is that how we should think about it michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think well give you better guidance on as we get towards the end of the year but its something as you its something that will take a few years to sort of work our way through that list and as charlie said were not done theres a long list of other items that are being vetted as we speak that sort of add to that list so charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and let me just add to it just so were not trying to be coy in any way shape or form what were trying to do is do what we said wed do which is we said last quarter wed give you what we thought was our clearest line of sight to our expenses for which is what weve done as we look beyond that we do believe there are significant additional gross cost saves to take out but were also making sure that weve got the ability as we go through the year to understand what continuing investments need to get made which include doing everything wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 that we need to do on the risk and regulatory front so we dont want to give a net number and box ourselves in and then believe we need to spend a different amount on the risk and regulatory stuff because thats going to be what it needs to be and so what the prepared remarks laid out was the gross saves are significant we expect to what were targeting is to continue to show net reductions yearoveryear so we continue on this path to increasing efficiency acknowledging that were not giving you the specificity beyond at this point john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thats helpful all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc charlie you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the banks number one focus is building the right management team obviously a lot of changes you at the top and your top operating team for the last months since youve been ceo are there still additional changes needed on that team and any specific positions that you would still like to fill charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so just first of all our number one priority is getting the risk and regulatory work done which will ultimately resolve these consent orders that we have the management building the management team is one of the key enablers in getting there ph yeah others and i feel great about the management team that we have i think that these are always it is always an ongoing process where were always looking at once one level gets filled everyone is looking to make sure that theyve got the right members of the team behind them and theres no question that with all of the talent we brought in from the outside given where we are that enables us to leverage more of the talent inside the company and put them in the right roles so i dont foresee the pace and the dramatic changes that weve made i think most of that is done at this point and then its just going to continue to build at the lower levels and recognizing that there are always some changes that happen here and there for different reasons david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 got it and i appreciate the color and then you talked about additional costs still needed to improve the operations in your investments in to get out of all the remaining consent orders where do you still think you need to spend do you have any areas earmarked at this point charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i mean so when we look at that what page is it its the page that shows the where we break out from the billion going to billion and then we break out the net billion reduction we show you the gross versus the investments embedded in that billion is a series of things roughly a third of it or so are specific adds that were doing to continue the work on building out the risk and control infrastructure those are everything from continued adds in compliance independent risk and all the functions that are necessary to for the most part build the operational compliance infrastructure thats required in fed and occ consent orders but it is the right foundational work to do we have a series of increases embedded in there which are investments in technology some of the expenses relate to things we need to build to get the efficiencies out but we also have some net increases there also to continue building out some product capabilities and things like that so ill just point you back to that billion as on a gross basis whats embedded in our numbers this year that is david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it appreciate the color thanks for taking my question charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator operator are you there hold on everyone give us a minute john campbell are you working on this operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co gerard better be a good one given the anticipation gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc there you go i thought maybe you guys on your expense savings you only paid for minutes and they cut you off short or something but anyway thank you for taking the question maybe mike i know the net servicing income is always volatile quarter to quarter can you share with us the what went on with hedging this quarter obviously it was a negative number but again i know its volatile quarter to quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure and gerard i may take you up on that idea by the way of limiting the call maybe next quarter look i think as you sort of look at the msr asset obviously theres a bunch of things that sort of impact whats happening which sort of drives the servicing income in there and i think a couple things you saw was the higher prepays and sort of the velocity in the mortgage market impacting that and then you also saw servicing cost as modeled so as you probably know with these assets like youre modeling your future cost which then reduces or increases your income in the current period and you look at that servicing income going up a little bit as you sort of look at the cost that you might have to incur given some of the forbearance programs and the extensions of those and so there wasnt anything outside of those items that was really driving the results gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup and i understand about the asset cap and the balance sheet but in your net interest income expectations in slide what kind of interest rate environment would you need to see for the drag that you give us in that slide for that to go away if you had your druthers if you could paint the interest rate environment that the sensitivity analysis im assuming you guys do what would we need to see for that to disappear michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look as i said earlier to get to the top end of that range were looking were using sort of the implicit the implied forward curve as it stands over the last week or so and so i think as you think about all else equal any steepening from here or just overall increase from here i think would be helpful and additive to that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate it thank you operator and you have time for one more question and that question comes from the line of erica najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my question and charlie thank you for your patience on this long call i just wanted to get back to the question on gross versus net and wanted to get clarity on the billion of investment spend i think earlier on the call you mentioned that it was still mostly related to risk and regulatoryrelated work and as we go forward and we think about the potential for a higher ratio of net versus gross how should we think about offensive more offensive type of expense of investment i think one of your peers today laid out billion in investment spend and million of which was related to tech charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 yeah so just to be clear because i dont want to of the billion thats in the investment line again roughly a third of that is very clearly the risk and control buildout but the reality is there could be other things that were doing thats in the remainder another big chunk of whats in that increase are things that were doing to drive efficiency in the company and then there are obviously things that were doing to build the future of the business to your question of how to think about gross and net the level of investments in the future i think that is quite frankly thats one of the reasons why were just being very careful not to commit to anything beyond for weve been very very thoughtful about what we believe we need to do what we want to do and what do we actually have the capacity to do and thats whats reflected in these numbers here weve hired a series of new people both from the business side as well as ather on the digital side and as we think through what the expense base could be in and beyond we dont know at this point what we want that increase to be which over time hopefully becomes more about building products and services that could compete more effectively in the marketplace and so im not sure again how to answer the question other than we expect to be doing that we do have some of it embedded in the numbers today but we want to make sure that we understand what we might want to do at the same time that were saying we believe based on everything we know today that we still should be able to do that and drive the expense base down on a net basis just not sure what the net number is sitting here today erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you for taking my question charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co of course operator and your last question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for squeezing me in ill be so a quick one firstly to start with which is expense reduction that charlie mike sorry i jumped over and didnt go with the pleasantries of saying hello because i know youre squeezing me in charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co no worries vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc you said revenue digits down low single digits from the business exits how about expense reduction michael santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 yeah vivek well give you more color as we sort of announce those and we get to the closing of some of those transactions but its probably not that different i think relative to the revenue contribution vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and charlie since this is the only opportunity we have to talk to you i have a question strategically just to understand since youre making a lot of changes three areas firstly cre since you are the biggest player have been what are you thinking there in terms of outlook for that business including your uk commercial real estate mortgage banking since youve cut back disclosure is that a sign that youre pulling that back a little and lastly charlie also your outlook for trading since assets are down sharply yearonyear and your plans for trading charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah listen cre as you can see in our disclosures is an extremely important business for us we think we have a great franchise which is made up of the customer base but its also the people that we have were not our portfolio is not immune to losses that will inevitably be taken because of this environment separate that out from we believe that we are hopefully more than appropriately reserved for that but time will tell the devil is in the detail when you talk about commercial real estate in terms of its a very broad caption but when you look at who youre lending to what the structures are obviously big difference between hotels retail office space the level of security you have and so we continue to believe that done properly it will continue to be a really important part of what we do and weve got a team that reacts appropriately and actions theyve taken certainly going even into covid will serve us well trading listen i think as i said before vivek i think youre expanding the impact a little bit i think theres no question that when you look at our corporate and investment bank in addition to our commercial bank when weve asked people to take actions to reduce balance sheet thats a place where weve gone and its true on the deposit side but its also true on the trading side as well both in terms of customer financing as well as trading assets where possible again i would say the same thing here i think our customers understand what were doing and why were doing it they understand the position that were in and i think when weve looked at where weve had to make reductions its been with an eye towards when the asset cap does eventually go away and we have a latitude to continue building as we were building in the past we would expect to see more resources put there certainly to bring us back in line where we were and then to build the business like we want to build the rest of our businesses at wells vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great one last one was mortgage banking charlie any color on that your plans for that obviously youve been a leading player its a much bigger piece for you than the other gsifis and what is your thinking on that youve cut back on correspondent what are you thinking as you look ahead given that youve cut back disclosures making me wonder charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 no listen i think its home lending is a really important business for us to be in i dont when we look at what we want to do to serve consumers across wells fargo home lending when i say consumers i mean both in our consumer and small business bank as well as customers that they deal with directly through their own channels as well as our wealth segment home lending products are extremely important to that relationship weve got a great team there as you know mike weinbach runs all of home lending kristy fercho joined us as the ceo of our home lending business and i think for us its going to be going to that next level of detail which is really understanding on the origination side by channel what does profitability look like how do we continue to drive more profitability how do we compete more effectively in digital originations where the banks generally have not done a great job versus what others have done and on the servicing side being more thoughtful probably than we have been about portfolio by portfolio what are the servicing economics where do we think it makes sense for us to service where does it not make sense for us to service and so i think what youll see is us becoming a finer point on what that looks like from a service perspective and driving more profitability on the origination side but its important for us vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay listen thank you very much certainly we appreciate all the time youve put in not just on this call but we know the revised disclosures create a bunch of work for you all but hopefully it helps us have a better conversation going forward as we talk about what the future of the company is and as i said i think weve got a lot of work still to do i believe were making great progress and when these headwinds abate and the actions that were taking are reflected in our performance i continue to feel really good about what the opportunity holds for us so thanks again for the time and look forward to talking to you some more take care operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call we thank you for your
