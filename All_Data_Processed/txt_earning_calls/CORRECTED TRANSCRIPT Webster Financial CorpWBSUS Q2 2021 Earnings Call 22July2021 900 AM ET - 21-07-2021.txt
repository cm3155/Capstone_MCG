chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john ill focus on key aspects of performance in the quarter which included strong loan growth improved credit performance and further progress on our strategic initiatives ill begin with our average balance sheet on slide webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 average securities declined million or less than linked quarter securities represented of total assets at june during the quarter we purchased approximately million in securities with a yield of and a weighted duration of five years securities called matured or paid down totaled around million with a yield of average excess liquidity being held at the fed totaled billion and increased million on average linked quarter this was driven by an increase in consumer and commercial transactional deposits average loans declined million or linked quarter primarily driven by million in lower ppp loans during the quarter forgiveness on ppp loans totaled million in q2 we recognized million of ppp deferred accretion and the remaining deferred fee balance totaled million at june excluding ppp average commercial loans grew million or while consumer loans declined million or while average loans declined periodend loans adjusted for ppp forgiveness grew by million or the growth reflects a increase in total originations from the prior quarter driven by higher commercial real estate and residential mortgage activity average deposits grew million or linked quarter the increase was driven by consumer and commercial transactional deposit products resulting from government stimulus payments round two ppp loan fundings and customer liquidity the growth in transactional deposits was partially offset by a decline in highercost cds average borrowings declined by million from q1 borrowings represented of total assets at june compared to a year ago the loantodeposit ratio was at june the common equity tier ratio decreased basis points linked quarter to driven by the increase in commercial and residential loans our tangible common equity ratio increased to and would be basis points higher excluding million and riskweighted ppp loans and tangible book value grew linked quarter and from prior year slide highlights our gaap performance and adjustments to reported income available to common during the quarter we recognized million of aftertax charges related to the merger and another from our strategic initiatives on an adjusted basis income available to common was million or per share resulting in a return on average common equity and a return on tangible common equity on slide we provide our reported to adjusted income statement net interest income declined by million linked quarter reflecting a quarteroverquarter decline of million in ppp fee accretion partially offset by lower funding costs of million and one additional calendar day nim of declined basis points from prior quarter split between the lower ppp fees and increased liquidity held at the fed as compared to prior year net interest income declined by million this was the result of lower market rates which reduced net interest income by million and was partially offset by million in lower deposit and borrowing costs noninterest income decreased million linked quarter primarily driven by fair value adjustments of million on customer derivatives due to decline in forward interest rate curves and lower mortgage banking fees partially offset by higher deposit service fees compared to prior year noninterest income grew by million this reflects an increase of million in deposit service fees driven by higher debit transaction volume up in hsa bank and in the retail bank in addition noninterest income growth included the fair value adjustments on customer derivatives higher wealth and hsa fee income partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue adjusted noninterest expense declined million from prior quarter reflective of continued progress on our strategic initiatives which ill discuss on an upcoming slide versus prior year noninterest expense declined webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 million due to lower compensation and benefits occupancy costs professional service fees and deposit insurance preprovision revenue was million in q2 this compares to million in q1 and million in prior year our cecl provision in the quarter reflects a benefit of million which ill discuss later in more detail the adjusted tax rate was an increase of basis points linkedquarter driven by an increase in estimated taxable income and a decrease in excess tax benefits the net result is an adjusted net income of million or per share down from per share in the prior quarter now let me provide an update on our progress related to our strategic initiatives announced in q4 of last year as you can see on slide we remain on track to deliver an to reduction in core noninterest expense and expect this to be fully realized on a run rate basis in q4 highlights of the initiatives include the consolidation of banking centers organizational actions to streamline execution and delivery for our customers optimization of corporate real estate and in june we launched our new digital account opening experience for consumers turning to slide ill review the results of our second quarter allowance for loan loss under cecl in the quarter we reported million benefit to provision and a million reduction in the allowance the allowance coverage ratio excluding ppp loans declined from to with total reserves of million as we look at the trend from q1 to q2 we built million in reserves related to commercial and residential loan growth which was more than offset by a million reduction due to improved credit quality and the macroeconomic trends credit quality improvements include a net recovery recorded in the quarter and downward trends in non performing loans and commercial classifieds in addition our macroeconomic forecast reflects improving trends in unemployment gdp and housing prices slide highlights our key asset quality metrics which continue to improve nonperforming loans in the upper left decreased million from q1 commercial commercial real estate residential mortgage and consumer each saw linked quarter declines net chargeoffs in the upper right reflected million in net recoveries largely driven by consumer from the strong housing market commercial classified loans in the lower left decreased million from q1 and represented basis points of total commercial loans improvement was driven by credit upgrades and pay downs within the sponsoring specialty and middle market businesses on slide we provide detail on payment deferrals related to the pandemic which have declined across the board down million or linked quarter and million or from year end at june total deferrals represented of total loans slide highlights our strong capital levels regulatory capital ratios exceeded well capital levels by substantial amounts our common equity tier ratio of exceeds well capitalized by more than billion likewise tier riskbased capital of exceeds well capitalized levels by million with respect to the third quarter we expect average core loan growth which excludes ppp to be approximately subject to individual loan funding and payoff activity we expect ppp loan forgiveness of approximately million net interest income will be relatively flat while net interest margin will be driven by the level of excess liquidity and the rate environment we expect noninterest income to be in the range of q2 levels on expenses we expect to continue make progress on our q4 goal of to core cost reduction and the tax rate will be between and with that ill turn things back over to john for closing remarks webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks a lot glenn we remain committed to delivering for our bankers our customers our communities and of course our shareholders consistent with our overarching objectives of maximizing economic profits over time and creating longterm franchise value i want to take a minute to thank each of our bankers for their dedication perseverance and hard work our bankers have met the challenges of a pandemic a yearlong comprehensive organizational and strategic transformation program and the announcement of an integration work associated with a gamechanging merger we expected a lot from our team and as our valuesbased bankers always do they delivered with professionalism competence and enthusiasm their commitment has enabled us to continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders with that melissa glenn and i are prepared to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens inc please proceed with your question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt how are you matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good first question maybe could you talk a little bit about the asset sensitivity of the combined institution and i really want to get a sense for how much of the combined portfolio will be subject is floating rates and subject to floors glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yes so matt good morning its glenn so if you look at the combined organization were very similar from an asset sensitivity standpoint and you can see back on in the back in the appendix our asset sensitivity to rise in basis points if i look at it and i look at the floating and periodic basis so total loans say billion of that i would say about billion is floating and periodic now there are some of those that have loans or floors so you probably back out about billion billion of floors and so that remaining piece once you back that out thats really what would be subject to the first basis point move say in rates and thats where you would expect to get the asset sensitivity webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 i think the wildcard here is on deposit betas and so there has been the historical betas have been around i think that has come down it has come down significantly if you look at our asset sensitivity were showing a increase in ppnr if we get the first basis point move in rates and a lot of thats driven by our reduction in deposit betas and so you see that has come down to like from to so i think thats going to be the wildcard as we begin to see rates rise i think therell be a lag and it could be anywhere from zero to to be honest with you matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay next one for me just on hsa thirdparty accounts the tpa accounts are rolling off slower than expected im sorry if i missed it but whats the remaining account balance that should roll off there and whats the new projection for when that transition is complete glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp i think the remaining account balance and i just say we had that back on the slides if you look in the appendix million in balances and i think the account balance is accounts so if you go back matt you look on our deck youll see that on page where we spiked out the tpa balances and the accounts so as john mentioned there was about million that moved out in the quarter and that was about accounts john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp and matt just to remind you we talked about that it seems like years ago but it was third quarter of based on the transaction the wageworks transaction with healthequity and another one of our sort of custodian accounts getting their own deposit charter and so we really dont have control of the timing of the departure and we also get exit fees during the quarter they leave so at least in the short term theres not a big economic impact over the long term obviously well replace those with accounts that are core to us that are more profitable ultimately matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then last one for me i just noticed that in fee income other free income was down quite a bit quarter overquarter came in about million versus million last quarter what was the driver of the of the decrease there and anything onetime that you would point out glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so a big driver of that was a valuation on our customer derivative book and that was driven by a lower forward curve on libor so what happens there is that the customer swap assets increase and so the credit portion of that also increases now thats a valuation adjustment i will point out that they are all cross collateralized so its not necessarily a risk and its more of a function of the rate environment youll see some volatility in that particularly as rates have jumped around so much quarteroverquarter john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 and matt thats a good question because our core kind of operating noninterest income fees were kind of flat in general and we had slight increase in our retail deposit fees slightly lower swap and syndication fees but that valuation adjustment is really what caused the delta between last quarter and this matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay thats all i had i appreciate you taking my questions thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you have a great day matt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush securities please proceed with your question david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning thanks for taking the question so i wanted to touch on loan growth it was great to see the rebound here in the second quarter and i was curious about how much of it is a function of increased loan demand from the borrowers versus you guys kind of pushing the envelope and being a bit more aggressive given how difficult the loan growth environment is for the banking industry john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp david i have a wiseass answer to that question but i wont do it well obviously were not pushing the envelope on structure or price too much i will say the pricing environment is really competitive talking to our head of commercial banking the structures havent moved really far away which is good but all good transactions particularly in areas like commercial real estate assetbased lending and others are extremely competitive from a price perspective this quarter were really pleased with the loan growth and as ive said probably a million times on these quarterly calls one quarter does not make a year and it depends on what happens with respect to pay offs and pay downs originations but i will say that im proud that our commercial bank over the last seven or eight years has just posted organic loan growth on an annualized basis year in and year out so in this quarter in particular as i mentioned kind of traditional middle market which was a really good sign that includes our public sector finance and our geographic middle market offices did really well and had strong originations our sponsor and specialty businesses in select verticals like healthcare healthcare technology and technology in and of itself continue to have significant demand and did quite frankly throughout the pandemic which obviously helped us continue to grow loans so as ive said many times we have tons of levers to pull across our geographical regions assetbased lending equipment finance our specialty verticals commercial real estate business banking and this quarter we just happened to see really nice originations that fit our raroc model they have good riskadjusted returns they fit our credit model and we remain confident that over the long term we can keep generating loan growth at the top of the market rates webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc and it sounds like the pipelines are pretty strong can you comment on where pipelines are today versus say a quarter ago and well clearly a year ago the pipelines were pretty bad but can you talk about pipelines today john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean i will say that our stated pipeline is stronger than it was last quarter and stronger than it was a year ago again im always hesitant because it seems like in our businesses particularly the transactional ones prepayments can drive ultimate growth but from an origination perspective across all of our key businesses pipelines are up david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc and then lastly on utilization rates on revolving lines can you discuss where the utilization rate is today versus a quarter ago john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i will its stable and i think this is the first quartertoquarter period where weve seen significant stabilization and maybe even a tickup but im not going to declare victory there utilization rates are still below prepandemic rates i think that has to do with so much liquidity in the system as well as supply chain imbalances and peoples inability to maybe build inventory in certain sectors so if i look at abl or across our traditional committed revolvers in commercial i would say weve seen stabilization to a slight tickup in utilization but still a good to on average below prepandemic levels david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thats impressive that you had such good growth with stable utilization rates so thatll be a nice tailwind going forward okay thats all i had thanks very much john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you david and thanks for the comment operator thank you our next question comes from line of chris mcgratty with keefe bruyette woods please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc kind of a question i asked on sterling call this morning was they sold some loans that were deemed higher risk into the close is there anything given the liquidity in the market is pretty high is there anything on your balance sheet that might be kind of right for pruning before you consummate the merger john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp i would say no strategically theres nothing really in our book that we think we would want to sell right now we have sold off nonperforming consumer loans at times where we thought the economics were right and we didnt have to carry them obviously because theyre a drag and a longer term workout but there are no pockets chris in our balance sheet right now that were eyeing loan sales in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp id note interestingly because i wanted to get this in that i believe this was our first net recovery quarter since before the great recession which is pretty remarkable considering we just came out of a pandemic and it goes to show how much liquidity is in the system and what government stimulus has done but we were even surprised by that outcome christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats a great development on the merger call you were i think pretty confident about just the pro forma growth opportunities of the company this quarter would certainly give credit that is it right to assume that today versus days ago that youre feeling better about i guess both nearterm and intermediate term loan growth john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah im feeling as confident lets say as confident chris im not sure i think our view always was and you heard us talk jointly on that call our expectations of loan growth for individually and on a combined basis kind of in that to and we talked about the fact that the second half of this year could be still muffled loan growth because of how much liquidity was in the system obviously we reported higher loan growth as did a couple of our peers and as we head into and weve talked about to to growth overall and i still feel pretty confident given whats going on in the economy absent some kind of real change with the delta virus i think this quarter certainly gave us additional confidence in our ability as we move forward to hit those numbers in and on a combined basis christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 okay thats great color i just wanted to make sure i understand the guidance real quickly for the quarter the net interest income stability comment is that gaap or is that excluding the ppp glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no thats gaap christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so million to about the same range christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and what i missed the ppp what was the in the quarter the contribution and whats left glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so ppp for the quarter contributed to net interest income about million which is down from million in prior quarter and we have million in remaining fees and i would say if you look over to the next three quarters its about a third a third a third that we are expecting from a forgiveness standpoint so about million a quarter in the next three quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then lastly the expenses and fees the expenses the pace came down quicker than i thought is this the kind of the range that the fully optimized like million million that the to implies glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no as we showed on the slide i mean our objective and we feel very confident is to get down to that million on a core expense run rate and so theres more that will come along off of the second quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and the fees were adjusting for the marktomarket or not im just trying to make sure i get that right for the quarter glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp the fees im not sure i understand the question webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i think wasnt your comment stable fee income kind of going forward in the third quarter glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah yeah yeah stable fee income and thats so im assuming that the forward curve in the case of credit valuations stay about stable christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks a lot for the clarification john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for the question maybe for those of us that are a little bit less familiar with sterling bigger picture i think weve all got a good sense of where your balance sheet is kind of headed here but is there anything you would call out in terms of sterling dynamics that in terms of runoff in certain areas that might help us kind of dimension the growth rate of the combined john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp brock first its good to hear from you and thanks for the question i would say no strategically right now and the work that we have done since after diligence since announcement has just confirmed is that i think all of the business lines that sterling operates in right now and the verticals are things that we will continue to look to grow over the longterm i think our management framework and me and jack and luis and glenn will continue to look at risk adjusted returns well look at opportunities in the marketplace well look at pricing and competitive dynamics well look at our position in the league tables and whether or not we can matter in certain asset classes or verticals but right now were going in with probably over different geographies and verticals and industries all of which we think are appropriate from a credit risk perspective all of which we think we can grow and as youve heard me say oftentimes having more levers than fewer levers is really helpful because you dont have to press on webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 credit quality you dont have to press on price in any one vertical that may not be as attractive during a period of time so i would say when you put these two banks together at least pro forma initially well be executing in all of the verticals and geographies that are aggregated between the two banks brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i think weve got a good sense of the loan trends on the funding side in terms of deposits anything you would highlight in terms of trends average to end of period is liquidity wave here in the process of breaking or how would you characterize that john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp we havent seen it break yet so average consumer balances average commercial balances municipal balances which by the way havent even seen the peak of their tax collection season theyre all significantly above average longterm and mediumterm average trends so our expectation is that well still be dealing with this for another couple of quarters before we see kind of fulsome economic activity and people start to draw down on their liquidity both individuals and businesses as they move towards more purchasing activity and more investment brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thanks for the color john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks brock operator thank you our next question comes from line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler on for jared john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys maybe just following up on that last question so the loan growth you saw this quarter are the borrowers maintaining higher levels of liquidity on your balance sheet and then borrowing in addition to that or are these borrowers that maybe dont have as significant a balance of deposits on your balance sheet and i guess just as youre thinking about the excess liquidity out there both on your balance sheet and the borrowers webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 balance sheet to what extent is that to longerterm loan growth guide a matter of borrowers first working through their own liquidity before really getting into the borrowing base at a more normalized level john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah thats a great question jared sic timur and im not sure i can give you a really detailed response most of the growth or origination for instance in commercial real estate and sponsor and specialty you dont really see that dynamic because youve got deal transactions that are mostly im going to use the little l leveraged not regulatory leveraged but theyre not dealing with lots of liquidity theyre using debt to acquire companies and so theres not that immediate offset when they borrow their cash or their cash comes out or theyre borrowing in lieu of deploying their cash i think its more strategic deployment of debt capital that does happen in some of our business banking and commercial cases where youre seeing them have lower utilization higher cash balances and then as you see them start to draw down on their lines of credit youll start to see kind of the dynamic interplay when they get lower balances theyll draw higher on their capital but i dont think what weve said all along is our hypothesis exactly what you just said which is theres going to be a period of time where loan growth demand will not return to its fulsome self until you start to see some of the companies and borrowers draw down on their liquidity but i dont i wouldnt say this quarter we saw kind of an offsetting activities in deposit account balances and draw downs on lines or the deployment of term loans timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color and then maybe looking at the sterling integration and how that process is moving along as youre getting deeper into the integration process and closer to closing the transaction i guess how are you feeling about the cost saves opportunity i think you had broken it down based on technology back office and kind of corporate facilities in the past is that a seems still realistic b is there potential to upsize that and c i guess again maybe going back to an earlier question is there an opportunity to maybe do something on the balance sheet in advance of the deal whether its on the liquidity side or whether its getting deeper into products prior to a deal close john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i would say answering your latter question first i wouldnt comment on any kind of activity balance sheet activity or product moves between now and close and i would stick with our initial guidance in terms of expense i think both jack and i mentioned that over the long term i think we both think that there are continued opportunities to leverage the like functions and to continue to get more efficient but i can tell you the integration is going well and kind of the budgets that were handing out for people to hit are right in line with what we talked to the market about on april and i think thats the appropriate level of efficiency and the appropriate cost saves to be going into this combination together and remember that that cost save amount that we talked about is a net amount which does give us some investment flexibility as we put the two banks together timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 okay and then just last question from me a modeling question the million of the strategic initiative and mergerrelated adjustments can you just provide the line items indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so its primarily in professional fees timur its glenn that is all primarily in professional fees i think the piece thats relative to the initiative is more spread out in other and lease the lease line but its smaller amounts so the biggest part of that million is in professional fees timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it thank you nice quarter john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our questionandanswer session ill turn
