you brian thank you very much brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you and happy new year to everyone good morning thank you for joining us im starting on slide of the earnings presentation here at bank of america our teammates finished with a solid fourth quarter reported eps was but that included two notable items that alastair will describe in more detail adjusted for those two items net income was billion aftertax or per share before alastair covers quarter four results i want to take a moment and briefly review the full year results our team at bank of america delivered strong profits for shareholders across a challenging year navigating a slowing economy geopolitical tensions bank failures and the impact of a rate hike of historic speed we began the year with a pretentious aura as economists predicted a mild recession within the year instead showcased economic resilience led by us consumers despite higher interest rates we ended with economists projecting the fed has successfully steered the us economy to a soft landing in regards to the economy during we consistently made a few points regarding what we were seeing in our customer data here at bank of america first the yearoveryear growth rate in spending from the beginning of started declining and it went from in the early part of over the early part of from a to growth rate to this quarters to growth rate and thats where it stands here early in you can see that on slide in the appendix that growth rate to is more consistent with a gdp environment and a lower inflation environment second the point weve made is that our consumer deposit balances at bank of america remain higher than prepandemic we saw the deposit balance of consumer accounts move lower this quarter but are now seeing more differentiation in behavior in the lower average balance size accounts the balances in there still remain at multiples of prepandemic levels nearly three years past the last stimulus they are modestly declining the deposit outflows youve seen in consumer have largely been driven by the higher balance accounts who have moved their excess balances into the markets to seek higher yields we capture those with our leading wealth platform third the consumers at bank of america have had access to credit and are borrowing responsibly their balance sheets are generally in good shape and while impacted by higher rates remember many of them have fixed rate mortgages and remain employed so theyve shown great resilience lets move to discussion of full year earnings we reported net income of billion aftertax which includes billion aftertax for notable quarter four items adjusted for those items the adjusted net income was billion aftertax earnings per share were and that grew over on a net adjusted basis we generated a basis point return on assets and a return on tangible common equity bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 year was characterized by record organic customer activity record digital customer engagement levels and satisfaction scores strong but slowing nii during the course of the year strong sales in trading up yearover year operating leverage reflected good expense discipline solid asset quality and a strong capital and liquidity position all of this was helped by the years of bank of americas assiduous dedication to responsible growth this helped us bring our head count and expense down every quarter during in line with what we told you to expect early this year early last year adjusted full year revenue grew on a back of nii improvement and strong asset management fees and sales and trading results we achieved basis points of operating leverage in as heightened quarterly expense levels were driven lower throughout the year even as the investments in growth continued net chargeoffs moved higher through the year off the historic lows but they still compare very favorably against historic averages one last point worth noting is the level of deposits if you think back as we ended and entered the great debate was how much the pandemic surge in deposits would dissipate but looking today we ended with trillion of deposits only billion less than we had at yearend and higher than the trough in may of this year the total average deposit fourth quarter remained higher than they did in the quarter four this has been tremendous works by our teams to drive our industryleading market share actually outperforming the industry across the fouryear period and again this year while the economy appears to continue to normalize and rates continue to have some volatility one thing that remains important is driving that organic growth this client activity sticks to the ribs is what we want to spend a moment as i wrap up on slide we highlight some of the successes in organic activity in our results for the year bank of america team is a powerful engine that is fueling results across all our businesses i want to note a couple of examples to try and connect the importance to our financials its easy to use the consumer business as an example in consumer we added net new checking accounts during the year the fourth quarter of represents the 20th straight quarter of net addition of checking accounts the quality is what drives the checking account balances on average of the deposit balances for customers that have been with us for more than years of the consumer checking accounts are primary meaning they are the core client household account of our checking accounts use our debit card they average transactions per account each year showing how engaged they are they have traditionally opened savings accounts to of the time within a few months of opening their checking accounts thinking about those new accounts at opening those new checking accounts opened last year bringing about of balances then they deepen over the next subsequent months to two times that amount new savings accounts come with those accounts starting with about and doubling over time from the total new checking accounts we opened just in those customers have opened nearly million credit card accounts with us so far in historically weve seen on average these customers more than double those card balances within a year those card accounts on average spend about per year of which a portion will carry a balance now there is always additional opportunity to further serve our clients and to continue to meet them where they are in addition to the industryleading digital platforms that we have we have opened new financial centers in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 more than half of those were in our expansion markets weve expanded our presence during to markets including our latest opening in omaha in our global wealth management team we added more than net new relationships across merrill and the private bank our advisors opened new banking accounts for wealth management clients showing the completeness of the relationship approach the average merrill account is over million at opening the average private bank account is multiples of that as you can see on the slide we now manage trillion of client balances across loans deposits and investments of our consumer clients both consumer and gwim we saw billion of flows into those accounts last year as we switch to global banking on the lower lefthand side of the slide we added clients to increase the number of products per relationship just like in consumer we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of our physical and digital capabilities but most importantly our talented relationship managers who provide financing solutions treasury services strategic advice for clients with local and global needs we added roughly new commercial and business banking clients this year that is more than twice what we added in we look forward to continue to drive with those grow with those clients in and add even more this capitalizes on a multiyear build of our relationship management team and the global banking businesses especially in product expansion also especially in the global transaction services area and mid market investment banking as we think about global markets we continue to see strong performance from our team with yearoveryear revenue growth the strongest weve had in many years we see digital tools our customers have access to across the board helping us enable this activity at lower costs our normal digital banking slides are once again included for your reference on pages and in summary this was a good quarter we delivered our third quarter of expense declines we saw nii outperform what we expected when we talked to you on the last earnings call we continue to manage well through the transition and the rate structure we saw deposits grow this quarter and we look forward with a strong capital base strong liquidity and growing loans and deposits to a great i want to thank my teammates for what they did for us in and we all know were off to a nice start for with that ill turn it over to alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and im going to start on slide of the earnings presentation to provide just a little more context on the summary income statement and the highlights for the fourth quarter as brian noted we reported billion in net income or per diluted share that gaap net income number included two notable items first we recorded billion of pretax expense thats aftertax earnings per share for the special assessment by the fdic to recover losses from the failures of silicon valley and signature bank second on november bloomberg announced that they would discontinue publishing the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index rate after november and many commercial loans in the industry had bsby as a reference rate prior to sofr becoming industry standard as noted in an 8k we filed earlier this week we came to a conclusion in early january that bsby cessation would not get the same accounting treatment allowed under libor cessation and therefore cash flow hedges of bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 bsby indexed products related to bsby cash flows forecast to occur after november would need to be moved out of oci and into earnings in the fourth quarter financials so as a result of the accounting interpretation we recorded a negative pretax impact to our marketmaking revenue of approximately billion i just want to reinforce thats an accounting impact its not an economic change to the contracts and well see an offset to this over time through higher nii mostly occurring in and after bsby ceases in november of the accounting lowered cet1 by basis points during the quarter and we will recapture that in the next two or three years adjusted for the fdic assessment and the bsby cessationrelated impact q4 net income was billion or per share on slide we show the highlights of the quarter and we reported revenue of billion on an fte basis and excluding the bsby cessation impact adjusted revenue was billion sic billion and declined driven by net interest income fourth quarter revenue is a tough yearoveryear comparison as nii peaked in the fourth quarter of at billion before slowly moving lower over outside of nii we saw good growth in treasury service fees and wealth management fees and those were offset by higher tax advantaged investment deal activity creating higher operating losses and more tax credits associated with them and recognized across periods expense for the quarter of billion included the billion fdic charge so excluding that charge adjusted expense was billion and consistent with our prior guidance that allowed us to invest for growth as well as use good expense discipline to eliminate work and reduce head count and on an adjusted basis this then is the third quarter of sequential expense decline this year provision expense for the quarter was billion that consisted of billion in net chargeoffs and a modest reserve release reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook net chargeoffs reflect the continued trend in consumer and commercial chargeoffs towards more normalized levels as well as higher commercial real estate office losses lastly our income tax expense this quarter was a modest benefit as credits from tax advantaged investment deals offset the tax expense on the lower earnings in q4 driven by the notable charges so lets review the balance sheet on slide and youll see we ended the quarter at trillion of total assets up billion from the third quarter id highlight here both the billion growth in deposits and a decline in cash on balance sheet of billion overall youll note that debt securities increased billion and that included a billion decline in holdtomaturity securities and billion increase in availableforsale securities reflecting shortterm investment of liquidity from all of these activities we continue to put money into very shortterm tbills and hedged treasury notes this quarter and those are essentially earning the same rate as cash and you can see our absolute cash levels remain quite high as brian noted liquidity remains strong with billion of global excess liquidity sources that was up billion from the third quarter of and it remained billion above our prepandemic level in the fourth quarter of shareholders equity increased billion from the third quarter as earnings and aoci improvement were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders the aoci improved billion reflecting both the previously mentioned bsbyrelated reclassification into fourth quarter earnings and other aoci improvements this included bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 some improvements in other cash flow hedges which dont impact regulatory capital driven by a decline in long end rates during the quarter we paid out billion in common dividends and we bought back million in shares which more than offset our employee awards tangible book value per share is up linked quarter and yearoveryear turning to the regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion from september while the cet1 ratio declined basis points to and remains well above our current requirement as of january we also remain well positioned against the proposed capital rules as our current cet1 level matches our minimum against anticipated rwa inflation from the proposed rules riskweighted assets increased billion on loan growth and growth in global markets rwa and our supplemental leverage ratio was versus the minimum requirement of which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains comfortably above requirements so lets focus on loans by looking at the average balances on slide and you can see loan growth improved this quarter as we saw improvement in both credit card and commercial borrowing offset by declines in commercial real estate and securitiesbased lending the commercial growth reflects good demand overall and was muted only at quarterend by companies paying down commercial balances as they finalize their yearend financial positions lastly on a positive note weve seen loan spreads continue to widen given some of the capital pressures from proposed rules on the banking industry and this combined with investment in relationship managers weve added over the past few years has positioned us to take market share and improve spreads moving to deposits ill stay focused on averages on slide and the trends of ending balances saw growth in global banking and wealth management and declines in consumer relative to the prepandemic fourth quarter period average deposits are still up every line of business remains well above their prepandemic levels consumer is up with checking up driven by the net new checking accounts added that brian noted earlier on a more recent performance basis deposits grew billion or from q3 on an annualized basis the only business that saw a decline in deposits linked quarter was consumer and here we saw a decline of billion this linked quarter decline slowed from the third quarter change and in total we have billion in highquality consumer deposits which remains billion above prepandemic levels the total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was basis points and this remains very low driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts most of this quarters rate increase remain concentrated in cds and consumer investment deposits which together only represent of the consumer deposits turning to wealth management balances on an endofperiod basis improved modestly and we continued to experience a slowing in the trend of clients moving money from loweryielding sweep accounts into higher yielding preferred deposits and off balance sheet our sweep balances were down billion and were replaced by new account generation and deepening global banking deposits grew billion moving nicely above the billion level that weve experienced over the course of the past six quarters these deposits are generally transactional deposits of our commercial bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 customers theyre the ones they use to manage their cash flows and noninterest bearing deposits were about of deposits at the end of the quarter now when we turn to excess deposit levels on slide you can see deposit growth exceeded loan growth this quarter and that expanded our excess of deposits above loans from q3 to about trillion which is well above the trillion we had prepandemic you can see that in the upper left of slide which is where weve used and shown you how we think about managing excess liquidity we continue to have a balanced mix of cash available forsale securities and heldtomaturity securities and this quarter the combination of the cash and the afs securities now represent of the total trillion noted on this page youll also notice the change in mix of the shorterterm portfolio as we began to lower cash and increase availableforsale securities by mostly shortdated tbills with similar yields you can note also the holdto maturity book continued to decline from paydowns and maturities pulling to par in total the holdtomaturity book moved below billion this quarter its now down billion from its peak and it consists of about billion in treasuries and about billion in mortgagebacked securities along with a few billion in others also note that the blended cash and securities yield continued to rise and remained about basis points above the rate we pay for deposits the replacement of these lowerearning assets into higheryielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit and support to nii from a valuation perspective given the reduced balance and the longerterm interest rate reductions weve seen in the fourth quarter we experienced an improvement of more than billion in the valuation of the holdtomaturity securities so lets turn our focus to nii performance using slide and a strong finish to the year helped us report billion in nii on a fully tax equivalent basis for the full year of thats up compared to on an fte basis we reported billion in nii which was modestly better than we told you to expect last quarter driven by modestly better deposit growth the billion was a decline of million from the third quarter driven by the unfavorable impacts of deposits and related pricing and lower global markets nii partially offset by higher rates benefiting asset yields and as we look forward given that weve got one less day of interest in the first quarter and thats worth about million to million and given the rate curve shift we believe the first quarter will be somewhere between million and million lower than the fourth quarter it could move a touch lower in q2 and then we believe it should begin to grow sequentially in the second half of so very consistent with our prior guidance with regard to the forward view i just provided let me note a few other caveats it would include an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and the forward curve today has six cuts compared to last quarter when we had three cuts in the curve so its bouncing around a little and shifted in the past quarter forward view also includes our expectation of low to midsingle digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of given our recent deposit and loan performance we continue to feel good about these assumptions before moving away its worth noting our net interest yield declined basis points to basis points and thats driven by the decline in nii as well as higher average earning assets reflecting prior period builds of cash and cashlike securities turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis the plus basis point parallel shift at december was billion of expected nii over the next months coming from our banking book and that bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast and of that sensitivity is driven by short rates the basis point down scenario is billion lets turn to expense and well use slide for the discussion and we reported billion in adjusted expense this quarter which excludes the fdic assessment this was in line with our projection from last quarter and down million from the third quarter driven by reductions in head count earlier in the year and seasonally lower revenuerelated expense these reductions outpaced the continued investments that were making to drive growth our average head count was down from the third quarter to people and thats good work after peaking at last january we lowered our head count through the year by and did so without taking an outsized severance charge as we used attrition to lower our head count along the way one more point to acknowledge the good work of our teams on expense q4 adjusted expense of billion is only million higher than the fourth quarter of and just remember we began with a million lift in quarterly fdic expense so through some good operational excellence work and otherwise weve managed through all of the additional costs of investments the new tech initiatives and merit and financial center openings as well as some stronger revenue and higher marketing costs as we look forward to next quarter we expect to see the more typical q1 seasonal elevation in expense of million to million compared to q4 so we believe expense will be around billion in the first quarter that includes elevated payroll tax expense and the expected cost of higher revenue in both sales and trading and wealth management as well as merit cost increases and as we move through we expect the quarterly expense to decline from q1 reflecting a drop in the elevated payroll tax expense and revenue changes as well as some additional operational excellence initiative work continued digital transformation and adoption is also going to help us as we go through the year now turn to credit and ill use slide for that provision expense was billion in the fourth quarter and it included an million reserve release due to a modestly improved macroeconomic environment on a weighted basis were reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly by the end of compared to the most recent rate reported net chargeoffs of billion increased million from the third quarter and the net chargeoff ratio was basis points a basis point increase from the third quarter on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and the overall increase in net chargeoffs was driven by three things first million of the increase was driven by credit card losses which continued to normalize as higher latestage delinquencies flowed through to charge offs second million of the increase was driven by a broad range of smaller commercial and industrial losses which were mostly previously reserved and monitored for the past couple of quarters and lastly million of the increase was driven by commercial real estate losses primarily due to office also mostly reserved in the appendix weve included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats provided last quarter and weve also included the historical perspective of our loan book derisking and longterm trend of our consumer and commercial net chargeoffs and you can see those on slides to lets move on to the various lines of business and their results and ill start on slide with consumer banking for the quarter consumer earned billion on continued good organic growth and despite their good client activity its difficult to outrun the earnings impact of higher rates on deposit costs while the credit is also bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 normalizing the reported earnings declined yearoveryear as top line revenue declined while expense rose and the credit costs rose customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth another strong period of card opening and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed billion over the past year to a record billion our fullyear flows were billion as accounts grew in the past months loan growth was led by credit card and that broke above billion this quarter deposit decline slowed in the quarter with continued strong discipline around pricing and our expense reflects continued business investments for growth and as you can also see on the appendix page digital engagement continued to improve and showed good yearoveryear improvement as customers enjoyed the continuation of enhanced capabilities moving to wealth management on slide we produced good results earning a little more than billion after adding net new relationships in merrill and the private bank this year these results were down from last year as a decline in nii from higher deposit costs still catching up from the interest rate hikes more than offset higher fees from asset management driven by higher market levels and assets under management flows as brian noted earlier both merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produced solid assets under management flows of billion since the fourth quarter of which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting their money to work expenses reflect continued investments in the business and revenuerelated costs on slide you see the global banking results the business produced strong results with earnings of billion as the decline from peak levels of nii was offset by lower provision expense leaving earnings down yearoveryear revenue declined driven by the nii our global treasury services business remained robust with strong business from existing clients as well as good new client generation in addition we continued to see a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter and our investment banking business continued to perform well in a sluggish environment yearoveryear revenue growth also benefited from lower marks on leveraged loan positions the companys overall investment banking fees were billion in q4 that grew over the prior year despite a fee pool that was down and for the year we held on to the number position overall given that performance in the component parts we ended the year number in investment grade number in leveraged finance number in equity capital markets and number in mergers and acquisition the diversification of the revenue across products and regions reflects the growing strength of our platform and a good example of that is our focus on the equity capital markets blocks business where we finished number in the united states for the first time since and in emea we were also number for blocks provision expense reflected a reserve release of million and that comes from an improved macroeconomic outlook as well as realized chargeoffs that are as noted before expense decreased yearoveryear as continued investments in the business were more than offset by reductions in other operating costs switching to global markets on slide the team had another strong quarter with earnings growing year overyear to million driven by revenue growth of and we refer to results excluding dva as we normally do good results in sales and trading and comparatively lower marks on leverage loan positions drove the year overyear performance and focusing on the sales and trading exdva revenue improved yearoveryear to billion which is a new fourth quarter record for the firm bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 ficc was down from a record quarter while equities increased compared to fourth quarter of and the ficc revenues were down versus that record fourth quarter level with higher revenues in mortgages and municipal trading equities was driven by improved trading performance in derivatives and our expense was up on continued investment in the business finally on slide all other shows a loss of billion as the two notable items highlighted earlier negatively impacted net income by billion in that segment revenue adjusted for the billion bsby cessation was flat yearoveryear and expense adjusted for the billion fdic assessment was down a couple hundred million driven by lower litigation and lower unemployment processing costs i noted earlier we reported a modest tax benefit this quarter the tax credits from tax advantaged investment deals throughout the year including their benefits in the fourth quarter exceeded taxes on reported earnings because we had the two notable items that lowered results this quarter for the full year our tax rate was a little more than and excluding the impacts of bsby cessation and fdic and the other discrete tax benefits that rate was and further excluding our investment tax credits our tax rate would have been so thank you and with that well launch into the qa please question and answer section operator operator instructions we will take our first question from jim mitchell of seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning guys alastair maybe on the nii trajectory that youre talking about sort of down a little bit in the first half and then start to stabilize in the second half and youre building in six cuts but a lot of those cuts are coming starting in sort of and beyond and given your asset sensitivity why would we expect nii to stabilize is that just sort of expected growth of deposits and loans just kind of help us think through your assumptions on the nii for alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well i think jim going back to last quarter i dont think our views have changed a great deal so our guidance isnt changing much either in that regard if anything q4 deposits were a little better than we expected so i think you see and we sort of thought this quarter might be around billion it was a little better than that so thats obviously a good starting point now when we look forward off of that slightly higher number if you think about q1 im thinking about it in terms of a day count that might be million lets say so from where we are thats going to get us to somewhere between billion and billion its going be in that kind of a range q2 we see going down just a little bit more thats a little bit of deposit seasonality in q1 and a little bit of just catchup on rate paid and some rotation but at that point we see growing in the back half of the year and thats largely yes deposits growing its loans growing a little bit its some restriking of the securities that come off the balance sheet and its restriking some of the loans that come off the balance sheet so its all of those things bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 youre right when we got together last quarter we thought there might be three rate cuts now its up to six so thats a little harder but the deposit picture has been a little better so no particular change at this point jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats fair and maybe just as a followup just on loan growth we all see the card growth but outside of that its been pretty muted were looking at rate cuts maybe thats a little bit better for demand what are you seeing on the commercial side in terms of demand and what changes the dynamic alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i mean you look back if you look at our loan growth in the materials its been a pretty slow loan growth environment and i think whats going on underneath it is obviously youve got the economic activity offsetting that a little bit is lower revolver utilization and you can sort of see why with rates being much higher its a little more expensive to borrow revolver so as corporate cash balances have come up and deposits have come up thats just a natural headwind thats beginning to fade so we kind of feel like the loan growth ought to be lowsingle digits normally we think about it as kind of gdp plus just a little bit of market share so in a low gdp environment thats sort of what were expecting for loans this year and then we just need to see how the rate structure develops jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay all fair thanks operator well take our next question from erika najarian of ubs ms najarian please check your mute switch your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi sorry rookie move i apologize for that alastair thank you for giving us more detail about how your nii trajectory is going to be for the rest of the year im wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on what youre expecting for deposit repricing and perhaps indiscernible specifically perhaps the liability mix in the second half of the year so if youd expect deposit growth to come back i think a big question that the market has is what is the repricing power to the downside that these banks have as the fed cuts rate so i think that would be really good color for the market to have alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah okay so first of all if i go back over the trajectory of deposits through the course of we troughed at billion and we ended at billion so underneath it theres billion of growth in deposits since may so that obviously informs our perspective around how we think about deposit gathering at this stage that feels to us like its a supportive environment of our nii forecast bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 second obviously over the course of this year theres been a move towards more interest bearing and that actually helps us in the event that we start seeing fed cuts because thats obviously going to allow us to take those rates down so look were going to see a little bit of rotation i think here in q1 and q2 i think well likely see a little bit of deposit pricing lag but the last fed hike at this point was july so theres been an awful lot of time at this point for deposit pricing to shake out we wont be immune from anything we have to compete for deposits along with everyone else but combine all of those things and thats where we get our confidence erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just to clarify how we should think about the full year the billion in expenses and a quarterly decline from there does that pretty much square with what youve said in the past for expenses of up to yearoveryear and would that number include an assumption that investment banking activity returns in force in brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so if you think about it prepandemic we reached a point where wed taken expenses down a place where we said wed kind of grow at sort of half the rate of inflation et cetera so youre right what were thinking now is roughly million in the fourth quarter over last years fourth quarter and if you think about that as and you look at the personnel side of it its up a little higher the nonpersonnel is down a little lower we got the rise in first quarter expenses then we start going down each quarter again so if you think about million to million of sort of inflationary growth over the quarters this year you get between billion and billion and most of the firms out there we look at are sort of in that range and we feel comfortable with that but that sort of allows us the room to use our good operational excellence to take out expenses and replace them with things like revenuerelated expenses that weve seen and we see that pattern reemerge now as weve gotten stability and past the pandemic and past the great resignation and all the inflation that occurred in the timeframe weve now stabilized back to that to really produce sequential declines in quarters during a yearoveryear growth of inflationary to levels and that gets you in that low erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you brian operator well take our next question from john mcdonald of autonomous research john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi alastair brian alastair wanted to go back on the nii and maybe you could help us its so hard for us to square the nii outlook with the rate sensitivity disclosure that you have in the slide with the basis point parallel shift down is billion maybe just is there some caveats about how in the real world it doesnt play out like the disclosures weve already seen rates come down on the long end almost basis points so i guess just where is that billion headwind in your number because its very impressive obviously to be able to kind of keep it flat despite that using the forward curve thanks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well i think that the main thing is number it obviously assumes a parallel shift instantly john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yes alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so the rate cuts that are in the forward projections the earliest one comes march for example so youre not going to see a full years worth of rate cuts all in the space of the first day or so it doesnt work out that way so john i think way to start would be just use what weve disclosed which is that billion you can see what we say in terms of much of that is the short end and then id just take that number and use that as the beginning point and just keep in mind we still see some deposit growth some loan growth and some securities and loan repricing that offsets all that john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay okay thats helpful and then maybe just on top of that trading nii or the global markets nii is that likely to be a headwind or a tailwind in versus do you have any visibility on that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well look if you look at global markets in any given quarter it moves around just based on the customer behavior but over the long arch if you look over the course of the past two to three years its liability sensitive so id expect if you see rate cuts that will benefit global markets nii just a little bit and you can almost like if you think about just retracing the steps of what theyve conceded in nii youd sort of expect to get that back over time john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay so maybe that could grow a bit brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp this quarter it was a drop third quarter fourth quarter a pretty good amount and so and thats partly due to the fourth quarter being lower activity just lower inventory carried and things like that that reversed itself and were off to a good start so far in the first quarter here and the balance sheet moves back up so theres a little bit of quarter to quarter linkage third to fourth quarter typically john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it thanks guys bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 operator well take our next question from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc oh hi just another followup on nii i guess if you take the fed dot plot maybe theres just three rate cuts if you take that instead of the six how would your thinking about nii change alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think if we got the three rather than the six mike wed do modestly better i think let me put it this way if we hadnt seen the three more since last quarter we might have a higher guide but because weve come off of a base with better deposit gathering in q4 so were starting in a better place so those two things have sort of evened themselves out but obviously if it pushes out later thats a good thing for us mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc brian alastair you always talk about the information advantage you have by just being in the flow of so much of the us economy what do you think i mean is this just and not rely and i know youd like to rely on your research group brian and what their economic forecast is but what do you guys think as far as are we going into a recession in the second half this year does the fed need to cut six times are you seeing that where are you seeing the most softness i guess is the question brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so i think our research team has rate cuts in next year and has a soft landing as you referenced mike so thats it as you see the customers today as i said earlier the yeartoyear spending growth in the fourth quarter versus last years fourth quarter or in the first quarter so far versus the first quarter last year is a to rate in movement of money and that was across trillionplus added to the consumer accounts in bank of america and to the economy that to is similar to what it was in when the fed rose took rates up inflation was under control and the economy was growing at and so the spending level should sustain at economy albeit our core prediction is its slowing down from a higher growth rate in the third quarter of whatever it was down to or something like that in the first couple of quarters next year but we see the consumer activity indicating that theyre still in the game theyre still spending money where they spend its a little different more in services and going out in restaurants and experiences and less on goods at retail theyre employed you know that if youd look at the estimates by any of you any of your economists the unemployment rate projected is really a modest deterioration from here and most of them is in the core base case our reserves actually set it almost to unemployment rate by the end of this year to give you a sense so thats good news theyre using their credit responsibly much is made of higher credit card balances but on the size of the economy and the size people are forgetting that economy is a lot bigger than it was in because of the inflationary thing and as a percentage we dont see any stress there we see a normalization of that credit bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 so theyre working theyre getting paid they have balances in their accounts they have access to credit theyve locked in good rates on their mortgages and theyre employed we feel its good so we think the soft landing is a core thesis and our internal data supports what our research team sees and they see it also through our institute mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just as far as controlling what you can control in terms of expenses and head count tech investments and maybe throw in ai as part of that what sort of extra efficiencies can you achieve through ai tech and other initiatives you squeezed a lot out over the last decadeplus whats left to go brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp theres always more to go so i think weve got lined up if you take what were doing this year and next year i mean and then roll it into its a couple billion dollarsplus which helps us to the dynamic eric was talking about avoiding growth and expenses keeping below inflation because if you think of us rolling that expense taking out back into good things this year will be i think billion on technology initiatives thats up from to by million or more and then sort flattish to theyre being applied in different ways we added relationship managers across the board we keep opening the branches were largely through the rehab of the branches that were keeping and these are all spending to grow and thats what youre seeing so net new checking accounts for the year thats straight quarters net checking account growth all good core accounts flows into the asset management business billion or more in our merrill lynch program the advertising has driven the business we have more customers and those customers of which to customers added in the last months those customers bring in average opening balance of to to give you a sense theyre not small accounts thats good so were just investing but theres a thousand levers none of them are simple but even this year when we said we got to get the head count growth back in line so after the great resignation in when we had to hire fast here we went from people in january down to at the end of the year and in that were rolling over teammates from one business to another business where we need help and retraining people and reskilling people and as ai comes in and to the extent that we can deploy it deploy it wisely it will allow us to redeploy people and even with our very low turnover rate which is for year and down from in year and i think in the fourth quarter we still can manage head count down just by not hiring people because that gives an opportunity to hire people this year so we can always hire little less if we see the efficiencies coming through and redeploy the people we have mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 hi just thoughts on capital allocation from here brian i think there were some and sorry if i missed it in the beginning but i think there were some media coverage about you guys or you talking about leaning into markets with capital i dont know if theres any way to kind of size that and then just broadly speaking like how you allocate indiscernible buyback levels and all that stuff thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah im not sure the media report but in the end of day jim demare and the team have done a great job so deploying capital and growing market share in the sales and trading business so theyre up yearoveryear in revenue ficc was up for the year equity was down a little bit down or so and that said theyve done a great job billion of revenue highest by a lot over the last few years and think about it in the timeframe we were billion in revenue so they fundamentally moved up that was deploying more more balance sheet you got a little bit more capital inherently but not a lot theyre not taking a lot of risk they made money every trading day in again i think and so they do a great job of serving the client so dont think it was a big capital a massive amount of capital they get the capital they need they have the balance sheet and the risk appetite they needed but were continuing to put money towards that business because they have proven to be successful we gave them the balance sheet a few years ago and they were able to deploy more broadly we pay off the dividend we then have a bunch of capital today we meet the standards as best as alastair said ph we could divine from the rule and well see what the final rule looks like when it comes out but right now the billion of cet1 is the level of notional cet1 we have to meet the rwa inflation im not saying its a good rule im just saying we make the math work so from now on we can basically deploy capital to the dividend payment couple of billion dollars a quarter and then everything above that will go to support business growth if we have it build a little bit of cushion we need to build over some period of time to meet these new rules if they come through and then share buybacks which we bought million or so last quarter and expect that to keep ticking up matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then you did mention that trading or markets is off to a good start so far this year obviously just a handful of days but any color around that and then kind of more broadly speaking as we think about the overall wallet like obviously banking is depressed but how would you frame the market trading wallet do we use as a jumping off point and grow it by some kind of longterm trend or any way to kind of frame that in terms of a base case thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well its too early for us to predict what the quarter will look like we will get a much better feel for that four five six weeks from now but i think you can use the numbers as a baseline starting point and then for the first quarter id just apply sort of a typical kind of seasonality q1 tends to be a very good quarter for us q4 less so just with the client activity and then just recognize that were starting from a q4 record so thats the only thing i would consider bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and then actually you mentioned investment banking matthew and the team exceeded what we thought in the quarter and seemed to perform better than the industry and actually were up a little bit yearoveryear but theres a full pipeline and the question is sort of when is the clarity and youre seeing some stuff get done and with stability and rates youd expect that to kick back up we typically run at about billion before the added activity because of the rate falling and the pandemic quarter were now billion billion you expect it to move back in those levels and we have actually been gaining share over the last few quarters as the markets gone down around us we held our relative position and grew it so i think matthew and the team is in good shape and this middle market execution has added a lot of throughput to the team and is building up over time operator well take our next question from glenn schorr of evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there good morning first question is on the deposits and i like the path that weve seen in terms of all the stimulus comes all the deposits come in you get some spending you get some migration you get some rich people buying treasuries great to see the stability in the fourth quarter and hear your comments about for deposits is a little encouraging wed always want more but its a little encouraging but my question is to be higher than is what i would call a lot more growth than a normal period of time would be with the up and down so is that a good thing or is that a risk and maybe the answer lies within how much of those excess deposits are sitting in all these new accounts that youve opened versus just cash from sitting around in existing clients that may be waiting to deploy i hope that question is clear brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so glenn you make me had déjà vu because basically i think you would have asked this question the first quarter of too on the theory that this was all going to run off and so when we looked at it we always said we had grown sort of in the period at the time of pandemic at sort of or a year in terms of deposit growth if you strung that line out were still above that line lets just say that and now were turning and growing so as alastair said we troughed in the middle of the year so weve outgrown what our sort of implied growth rate would have been against size etcetera so we feel good about that its all core now if you look at the underlying dynamics you think about the different clients we have if you start with the wealth management clients discretely in gwim those balances came down and are bouncing around billion billion billion on a given day and theyve been relatively stable now for i dont five six months i think bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 if you look at the wholesale banking whats happened is they came theyve shot up came down after the pandemic and then theyve been growing back and theyre actually stronger because just the activity has picked up and a stabilization of line usage shows that the environment around their borrowing and cash is more consistent so thats been good and if you look at consumer thats where we are saying earlier if you think about consumer what you see if you take the people accounts with us their balances and all their deposit accounts prepandemic to now if you look at people had in consumer not in wealth management million in collective balances prepandemic they are down they moved the money theyre going to move and so for wealth management and consumer largely people who are going to move money out to get rates have done that and is it still bouncing around a little bit in consumer yeah theyre billion more or less on a given day but its stabilized and been relatively consistent for the last four six eight weeks but thats got to settle in and then you grow out from there but what thats really telling you is theyve kind of moved the money theyre going to move mostly because they did it and you dont get that money twice so you moved a chunk in these higher end consumer balances they moved of their balances over in to get in money market funds which we captured and other things and yeah they dont have it to move again because that was accumulated balances that they had in a zero interest rate environment prepandemic plus whatever other things they got so if you look at the slide you can see the deposit slides laid out by noninterestbearing and interestbearing but the key is that consumer was billion going into the pandemic sits at billion today and if you look at the checking its still up billion and thats kind of balancing around you can see its moved down a little bit but thats really the people with highend checking balances that have moved it into the market glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats all good more than i was looking for i appreciate it the quickie followup on reserves now as you mentioned indiscernible brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp glenn just one back indiscernible glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi sure brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp look at the consumer banking page its basis points all in and it was four or six quarters ago and so and thats all driven by the cds we dont have a lot of cds and some of the highend money market pricing but the point is if it was going to be moved its think about that so the money thats moved is moved and we pay bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 higher rates for very high balances and stuff like that so especially like the merrill edge platform so a lot of that dynamic is through the system right now for lack of better term glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi no thats great good comment i appreciate that a quickie on reserves is with a pretty solid economy a resilient us consumer your npls are down you have a lot of reserves the question is what are the signposts that you or we should be looking for to know when youve added enough when we are stable enough point in time and you actually start funding chargeoffs from reserves and not adding thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp i think were getting pretty close now because things are beginning to stabilize theyre beginning to normalize this is a period of transition for the economy and its a period of transition for our clients too a lot of them are dealing with higher interest rates and theyre just beginning to moderate and change their spending behaviors so weve seen a trend over the course of the past few quarters its pretty predictable around the consumer side you can see that in our disclosures i think its slide and but thats going to bounce around over the course of the next couple quarters now that were back towards levels its going to settle in we think in the first half of this year and then on the commercial side the asset quality remains really in a very good position we happen to have a couple of names that popped up this quarter but to your point we were pretty fully reserved against them that wasnt a surprise to us weve seen those for the course of the past six months so we think were getting close there glenn and obviously the closer we get to a soft landing the better were going to feel about that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp glenn as you think about it when you said reserves remember because under cecl and stuff weve always got sort of the lifetime reserve methodology which were all still getting clear now weve operated under it for a few years but this quarter we actually had commercial reserves come down to pay for the chargeoffs on a specifically prior period reserved properties or loans and that happened and so you saw some of that be careful on the consumer side because basically the pay as you go side of the consumer side is still building up to a nominal amount of chargeoffs consistent where it was in so if you look at card in the chargeoff rate across the eight quarters ranged from a low of and a high of were at today but were billion billion higher balances so youve got to be careful of the nominal amount to get that right if you go look at it more broadly all the company we had a basis points this quarter and the range in those eight quarters was basis points to basis points but whats difference is the cre piece of that and the chargeoffs so the reserve to loans and all the classic factors to look at are very strong the reserve has set itself with basically half the reserve is driven by the adverse case scenario to give you a sense versus the base case and then some judgmental on top of that and so as it becomes clear that were in a soft landing to alastairs point theres less allocation to those scenarios we always will make some bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 but when you put all that together and weight it it has unemployment pushing up in the high and you look at unemployment today its nowhere close to that and theres no prediction to get there in the base case so thats what will start to ease up on the general reserving but remember on card its a bit of payasyougo and we were running around reserves were up to against card now so there might be a little bit coming back but not that id rather have the growth to sop that up down to in cards than give it back to reserves glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats great color thank you for all that operator well take our next question from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good afternoon just a technical clarification on that bsby billion so i presume that you start to get that back mid quarter next year given the november sic termination and then does it just run out ratably just wondering how over what exact period of time you get that billion alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah okay so brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey ken happy new year this year is so ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc correct sorry alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp ken yes youve got it right well get some of it back at the back end of so well get a little bit in the fourth quarter and then id say we get most of it back in most of the remainder back in thats the easiest way to think about it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so its alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp you had it right bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc so is it straight line or is it a little bit front like i just want to get alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp a little more ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc is it a straight line divided by or it has a little bit of like a tail alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp no its got a little more in than ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay okay i got it thank you indiscernible ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and just one question can you just remind us brokerage fees this quarter felt the impact i think you said it of the soft averages from this quarter and so i think should we expect to see just from the markets bounce that we saw in the fourth quarter that to play well into the first quarter starting points from the management fees perspective alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i think you should expect our global markets performance to continue right now i mean obviously this is a pretty constructive environment for the markets business at this point i dont think anything has changed there theres a lot of client repositioning going on so i think the fourth quarter is sort of the right number to start with and then youve just got to i think adjust for the fact that obviously youve got a stepup in their activity in q1 i dont know if i misinterpreted if youre talking about the wealth management ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp then those fees are obviously just going to work on the monthly lag based on where the markets go over time so obviously the markets are elevated right now and that should portend well for the future bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thats what i was getting at yeah thank you right just confirming that we didnt see the benefit yet that comes further based on the averages and how that will play forward presuming the market hangs in there alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp correct that tends to be a lag by a month or so so youll see that in q1 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator well take our next question from ryan kenny of morgan stanley ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks for taking my question just following up on a few questions ago on the commercial credit side so the commercial net chargeoffs did roughly double sequentially and you mentioned that there were a few customers that popped up should we interpret that to mean that the pace of deterioration decelerates and it was just a one off or is there anything else going on under the hood there alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so i dont think let me put it this way i think its too early to conclude that its anything other than just a momentary spike up but if you look at that chart essentially whats going on is two things first weve got a little bit of office and thats going to bounce around over the course of time it just takes a while to resolve that portfolio its pretty small for us obviously we feel like were doing all the right things with it but that was a little elevated this quarter relative to the prior three and then more broadly in commercial there were a couple other things that took place this quarter again we were pretty fully reserved against them so we sort of saw those coming asset quality generally in commercial remains in a very very good place outside of the office sector and you can again see that in terms of look at our ph reserve were criticized that declined this quarter so i dont think theres any change there the issue is just that were starting with such small numbers in commercial that anything appears like a spike ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks and just one more clarifying question on nii so in the scenario with the six rate cuts can you help us understand how you expect the deposit mix to migrate and specifically with the migration from nib to ib deposits grind to a halt or is there any scenario that where nib deposits actually start growing again alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 well i think what were trying to describe is a sense that were getting towards the tail end of this now partly because were now six months away from the last time that the fed raised rates and then partly because if we do have rate cuts its going to start to disincent people moving out of noninterest bearing so thats what were describing over the course of time weve got to see how that develops through the course of the year ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks operator well take our final question from gerard cassidy of rbc brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi brian hi alastair you guys have obviously done a very good job in the consumer banking area with digital banking and i frame that for you guys in this question we hear a lot about ai and what it could do for the banking industry and when you look out over the next three to five years and you invest in ai to improve efficiencies could it have a similar impact what digital banking did for consumer banking preiphone to where we are today in your business or is it going to be more like blockchain where there was a lot of discussion about the future of blockchain but we dont hear much about that anymore do you guys have a view on what ai could be for your business over the next three to five years brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i agree with you im not sure theres a relevant comparison to blockchain but lets just focus on ai if you look at you can see the digital movement one of the things in the digital movement you see is erica in the lower lefthand chart on page gerard and you can see that in the fourth quarter the million interactions with erica where people effectively answered their own question and another million people from last year to this year using it on a basis of million up to million people using it unique users and thats just an example and thats ai in early stage we built that starting years ago it operates on our data use natural language processing we have to keep updating that for the way people use words that process but think million phone calls walks into branches emails et cetera where that inquiry would have to go through another place and its abled our clients to do things and find them so we think that theres vast promise for ai were deploying it in places a lot of internal stuff we help employees work better work faster were doing it we have it in our coding shop theres coders using it to continue to improve their effectiveness and learning it but its still the care that has to be taken on data and usage and models and accountability all that stuff is still high so were using it for things that are a little easier and we think it has great promise its just going id say its going to be more similar to digital what the pace will be will be a little bit of how far it can go before you start to run into difficulties applying it effectively but it plays off the same thing that weve done in digital and erica and other things we brought erica over the commercial side now so that cashpro uses erica bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 to answer questions and were seeing the uses of that grow and you can see the customers interface and be comfortable with it and thats good so it will have tremendous help as its applied in more and more ways we are still trying to hear and see if it really works how much benefit it generates can it be controlled under the model outputs controlled and also the things but weve had algorithmic machine learning type models all over our company for years and so the billions weve spent literally over the last years on data cleanliness data order getting the data in the right place making sure its dependable and the models operate indiscernible open autonomous natural language models but are models that are machine learning models weve seen great promise thats partly how we operate the company now basically on the same dollar amount of expenses we had in or to give you a sense so yes its been digitization but its also been using more of that so its got we have high hopes for it we just have to make sure it does a great job for the customer gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and as a followup weve been reading and seeing a lot of information about the private credit markets making inroads and we know the shadow banking industry has been around for a long time our entire careers what are you guys seeing today is it more competitive against the apollos and blackstones in lending and then second theyre also im assuming customers of yours so how do you balance servicing them but at the same time they could be a direct competitor in the lending markets brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well thats all the issues that weve got to balance on a given day but and we can originate loans into their platforms and there are lots of things we can do so we continue to work through that i think to take it more broadly my colleagues and i have made clear that the strictures around our industry the methodology operating and the openness and ability to operate outside has led to the mortgage business largely being done outside the industry and most other asset classes for lack of better term being outside the industry and the private lending is just another case of that and i think were very competitive we do a great job and we have trillion of commercial loans outstanding we have hundreds of billions of dollars of midsized companies et cetera so we think theres a way that we can do this with our clients and help them and help us a lot of them are asking can you help us originate loans i think its still a question ahead of whether the policy of having more things going on the bank industry is a good policy of course we in the banking industry dont think its a good policy because the reality i think inherent in part of your question was when these companies bounce around because of economic stress or for them as an operator the banking system has a workout methodology not a liquidation methodology or a trading methodology and that served american enterprise very well and so i think we have to be fair and see how it affects the economy that way and those are issues that were true prepandemic and have become more acute so we feel well be competitive no matter what nothing scares us weve got a great team and they do a great job but its endemic of the issue that you keep pushing too much capital regulation stuff will find its way outside the system and that doesnt mean the risk has changed it just means it moved from purview of the regulators and thats one of the points we make but on the other hand we are working with those enterprises to help us be a combined effective competitor bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good brian i appreciate it operator this does conclude our questionandanswer session id be happy to return the call to mr brian moynihan for closing comments brian t moynihan chairman chief
