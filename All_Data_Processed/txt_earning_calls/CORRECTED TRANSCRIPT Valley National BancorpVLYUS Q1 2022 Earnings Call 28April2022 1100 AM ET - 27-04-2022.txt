make this morning and then we have time to provide some insight on our loan growth and strategic progress mike will then discuss the quarters financial results in more detail in the first quarter of valley reported net income of million earnings per share of and return on average assets of exclusive of noncore charges eps and roa would have been and respectively the benefits of our diverse and agile business model and strong balance sheet were evident during the quarter strong organic net interest income growth and robust swap revenues more than offset both a million reduction in ppp income and mortgage banking headwinds tangible book value was also preserved as the march valuation of our relatively modest available for sale portfolio had limited impact on our equity over the last few years we have made significant investments in both people and technology to capitalize on the enormous and diverse growth opportunities we have identified the organic growth results that we continue to generate justify these investment efforts exclusive of ppp gross loans increased billion during the quarter or over on an annualized basis these impressive results are a continuation of the success we have seen over the last year in the past months we have generated nearly billion of organic loan growth representing a increase from march of tom will provide additional details on our loan growth and strategic efforts in a moment as it relates to bank leumi we were very pleased to close the transaction as expected on april onboarding and integration efforts are proceeding in line with our expectations and we are already observing exciting collaboration between the teams leumi generated strong commercial loan growth in the first quarter and noninterest income is running ahead of schedule importantly their differentiated technology banking business also has seen a solid increase in deposits since announcement the compelling strategic rationale for the transaction is more evident than ever and we are extremely excited for our collective future during my tenure as ceo valley has proven the ability to grow both organically and through acquisition our current focus is on successfully integrating bank leumi and driving continued organic growth within our combined organizations while we strongly believe ma provides opportunities to accelerate our strategic initiatives we do not anticipate being active in the traditional bank ma market in the near future now i want to ask tom to discuss our loan results and what we view as key strategic drivers for our revenue growth thomas a iadanza senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp thank you ira as ira mentioned during the quarter we generated billion of nonppp loan growth as expected growth was primarily concentrated in our commercial segment and was diversified across geographies specifically cre growth was split approximately between our northern and southern regions ci growth was more balanced at approximately valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 on the construction side we saw an increase in advances on previously approved projects while a sequential growth in construction loans is strong on an annualized basis the dollar increase was relatively modest and this segment continues to comprise only of our total loan portfolio we remain optimistic on our prospects for organic loan growth throughout the year as of march the loan pipeline was historically high at over billion while the first quarter results benefited from some pull forward we anticipate generating loan growth in the lowdouble digits over the last few quarters we have discussed our new market expansion efforts and lending hires we are pleased to report that as of march these initiatives have contributed million and the million of loans respectively while total deposits were flat during the quarter we continue to have a diverse set of funding channels available to us specifically we benefited from meaningful commercial checking account growth over the last few years we also continued to grow our niche efforts targeting homeowners associations cannabis companies and professional services firms this enabled us to allow retail cds to runoff further during the quarter rounding out the revenue discussion we saw noninterest income improve modestly swap revenue was robust and helped to offset a challenging mortgage banking environment during the quarter we are working hard to develop and grow sustainable sources of noninterest income during the quarter our diverse revenue streams helped absorb the headwinds of a volatile market all in non ppp revenue increased from the first quarter of we are heading into the second quarter from a position of strength and expect a combination of loan growth and rising interest rates to contribute to strong revenue growth throughout through the remainder of the year ira d robbins chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks tom as you can tell we are laser focused on driving organic loan and revenue growth which we believe will result in additional positive operating leverage over time admittedly over the last two quarters we have seen expense growth outpace revenues this is due to a combination of proactive investments on our part and broader external expense pressures seen across the entire industry we continuously work to limit and offset when possible growth in expenses and are confident that revenues will accelerate as a result of our commercial lending engine and the expectation of rising interest rates we continue to focus on positive operating leverage and believe this progress will emerge throughout the year with that ill turn the call over to mike to update our guidance and discuss some of the quarters financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira i will start this morning on slide with an update on certain guidance items that we provided in january due to the exceptional growth generated in the first quarter and an improved outlook for the rest of the year we are increasing our organic loan growth projections to a range of to as a result of this higher growth and using the forward curve as of march we now anticipate 2022s net interest income growth of between and as a reminder we project this growth compared to reported net interest income which included approximately million ppp loan interest and fee income slide illustrates valleys recent net interest income and margin trends net interest income increased over million from the linked quarter despite a million reduction in ppp income this reflected the benefits of liquidity deployment into loans as well as a full quarters impact from the westchester bank acquisition valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 our reported net interest margin declined basis points to exclusive of ppp however the margin increased basis point to from in the fourth quarter we estimate that the first quarters lowered day count weighed on both recorded and ppp adjusted margin by approximately basis points additionally we saw the margin expand throughout the quarter as cash was put to work we anticipate further benefits from rising interest rates as origination yields expand and our floating loans reprice higher while lagging deposit costs may not be easy in the future our focus on less sensitive commercial operating accounts and the diversity of our funding sources should provide a relative benefit as rates rise slide details our loan balances and the key drivers of our strong growth during the quarter as tom mentioned earlier our nonppp loans increased over billion or from december our growth results continue to benefit from geographic and asset class diversification we were also pleased that loan origination yields increased basis points during the quarter turning to our deposit composition on slide you will see that total deposits were flat as compared to the fourth quarter that said noninterestbearing and other transaction account balances continue to increase replacing a further reduction in our cd balances you will see that noninterest and transaction accounts comprise and of total deposits up from and in the first quarter of respectively during the quarter our cd and nonmaturity deposit costs declined basis points and basis point relatively over the last few years our deposit transition has benefited in part from a focus on commercial operating account originations the niche focus areas that tom mentioned earlier also contributed to the growth in transaction balances during the quarter moving to slide we generated noninterest income of million for the quarter as compared to million in the fourth quarter and million in the first quarter of the linked quarter increase reflected higher swap income and advisory fees which offset a meaningful compression in mortgage banking income as the expectation for higher interest rates accelerated we saw more customers opting for floating loans with an associated swap mortgage banking results were pressured by both lower sales activity and a negative valuation mark on our loans held for sale at the end of the quarter on slide you can see that our adjusted expenses were over million for the quarter as depicted in the waterfall chart this includes approximately million of expenses related to elevated seasonal factors a portion of the nonseasonal expense increase is for investments we have made to position ourselves for the significant growth that we continue to achieve that said we acknowledge that pressures on other business as usual expenses continue to build we are working to maximize efficiencies to ensure that more of our anticipated revenue growth will drop to the bottom line as a result of our ongoing review of delivery channels we are targeting approximately branch locations for closure by the end of the year turning to slide you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters our allowance for credit losses declined to of nonppp loans at march from at december for the second consecutive quarter we recognized modest net recoveries still we recorded a million provision largely to account for the significant growth that we experienced nonaccrual balances continued to decline in the first quarter driven primarily by our cre and ci portfolios while early stage delinquencies ticked up in the quarter much of the increase is associated with what we consider noncredit issues we remain confident in the quality of our underwriting and our future credit performance on slide you can see that tangible book value was flat for the quarter and approximately higher than a year ago the lack of quarterly tangible book value growth is primarily the result of the modest negative oci impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 relative to peers this headwind was minimized as a result of our relatively small securities portfolios and modest afs exposure which reflects our continued focus on tangible book value preservation as our loan and securities growth was primarily funded with excess cash during the quarter tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was effectively flat however our riskbased regulatory ratios declined as we replaced cash with loans carrying a higher risk weight with that i will turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of frank indiscernible from piper sandler your question please frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just on the updated guidance it seems like the nii growth the change there is just really a function of the increased loan growth just wondering is i would assume the revised guidance has more rate hikes baked in and just wondering given your alco positioning if thats sort of de minimis or how you have that baked into guide michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp frank its mike ill go ahead and take a stab at this one we do have seven fed rate hikes included in our modeling and then also i would point out that the lower end of our nii guide reflects a potential beta stress test that while we dont anticipate will actually happen we want to be prepared for so we have stress test stress tested that range for various beta outcomes which i think will be the bigger driver down the road frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay so the low end is a few seems like given where liquidity is in the banking system you dont really expect to get to the betas that would be implied by the low end to guide is that right michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp on the low end thats correct yes valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co and then just on the continuing again just to follow up on the loan growth guide what the more normalized utilization rates look like versus where they are now and just wondering if you have any of that pickup baked into your expectations thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah hey hey frank its tom were seeing a slight uptick on the utilization rate from to so nothing material but with our focused relationship driven ci and commercial growth we are seeing an increase in our committed lines so were going to get a natural real dollar increase but we havent baked in anything above that utilization rate frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay great thank you michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thanks frank operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael perito from kbw your question please michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i want to start piggybacking on one of the franks question so the you guys obviously updated some of the revenue guide on the topline the efficiency guide is unchanged so i guess just kind of a simple question i guess do you guys have kind of increasing confidence given the updated nii outlook that thats more going to be towards the below versus at part of that range or are there other kind of accelerated expense growth items or investments we should be mindful of that that might have pay off longer term but nearterm will offset some of that that that pick up in the top line michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp ill take a stab at this one the guide that we would give is that were fairly confident with the core run rate being around million but as a reminder i want to make sure everybody knows the first quarter of this year valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 included the westchester bank which we estimate contributed around million of nonseasonal sequential increase so that somewhat overstates the growth rate but to the degree that there is any expense growth in the second quarter we would expect it to be much more modest and obviously to achieve positive operating leverage we understand the need to lag that expense growth as our revenue growth accelerates and so thats really the strategic imperative travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp and mike this is travis just to followup on that and it goes back to mikes prior response it will be unchanged guidance is more tied to the low end of the nii range to be at that beta stress test that would be otherwise we would anticipate some improvement to the efficiency ratio michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats helpful and then secondly just on some of the newer platforms that you guys are well i guess already have gained access to on april like the venture banking side some of the commercial lending in non kind of traditional value markets maybe thats not the best way to put it but miami chicago curious how those have performed over the first quarter and and if theres any kind of notable updates there that are worth mentioning in terms of the growth profiles of those newer platforms that you guys are bringing on thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah mike i will ill kind of explain it and on the different our new platforms at legacy valley was our entrance into philadelphia nashville and atlanta and we have seen very strong growth and keep in mind a lot of it is following our existing customers who go into those markets as our starting point then we build we put feet on the street and we start building more locally from there and weve seen that success first in philly and now in the others when you mentioned chicago and miami and i think you mentioned los angeles im not sure thats really related to leumi and the new businesses that we obtained through the leumi merger the first quarter all of those were active they had very strong pipelines and origination results annualized growth for the leumi portfolio in total on the loan side with a little over so i think that answers your question yeah thats two different market questions valley legacy and a new leumi michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats great color just the only other item i mentioned was just on the venture banking side ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp mike this is ira i think as tom alluded to theyre really not in any of our numbers yet but were really excited about the opportunity that theyre going to bring to us the tech business as you know is really focused more on the deposits from the time of announcement to where we are today weve seen significant increases north of in those deposits so we continue to be really excited about what that business is going to bring to us from a core funding perspective michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 awesome helpful and then just lastly for me and ill step back just on the buyback i know you guys have historically had an authorization outstanding this one seems to be a little bigger or we have a shorter time period around it i appreciate your comments on bank ma near term here so is it fair for us to think that with some of this pullback here and some of the clearly positive outlook you guys have for your business that that could be utilized to some degree or with some regularity or is it not necessarily is that reading too much into it ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think youre probably reading a bit too much into it but i think from a normal governance process perspective it absolutely makes sense for us to have a buyback and we havent had a new one since so to be able to put something in with some significant optionality and i think makes a lot of sense for us and with that said i think the priority continues to be to support a strong organic loan growth when we think about the capital utilization is a tremendous organic growth number what that may not continue we do anticipate strong organic growth to continue for valley and obviously the best use of capital continues to be for that utilization michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc very good helpful thanks on all accounts appreciate it ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your question please steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp hi steve good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so not to beat the dead horse on the nii outlook but if i look at the loan to deposit ratio its near so i would assume youre going to need to fully fund loan growth with deposit so one is that correct and then secondly what is the range of deposit beta youre assuming at the low and high end of the nii guide ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp so the average for our modeling is the range on the highest i think maybe gets at about yeah around so i mean those are pretty extreme examples youre not wrong obviously deposit growth for the kind of loan engine that we have is really important and maybe i would remind everybody on the call today thats kind of why we have the various delivery channels that we have and when you look at our valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 organic growth both in personal and business accounts weve grown both every quarter over the last two years and maybe its times like this that its great to have the retail footprint that we have that makes up roughly a third of our total funding sources because in the consumer space they tend to be a little less rate sensitive and even if they are as rate sensitive as the commercial side its another avenue another product offering that we can offer to meet the needs of this growing balance sheet on the lending side michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp steve i just maybe to add to that a little bit i think over the last few years theres been an intense strategic focus in this organization to diversify the funding source and our organic loan growth has been a significant priority as well for many in the industry assets have been really the focus for us the strategic focus has really been on the liability side in conjunction with the assets we entered into the cannabis market we work more on hoa market tom talked about some of the areas from the financial perspective businesses that weve gone after the shift in balance sheet from cre to ci that brings a lot of deposits as well has really transformed what the balance sheet looks like and i think you can sort of take a look at what happened from the nim this quarter traditionally going from fourth quarter to first quarter is a challenge for us especially in a rising interest rate environment and when you look at valley you historically say were cre reorganized northeast bank that would have had a liability sensitive structure were actually asset sensitive and you saw that in this specific quarter thats obviously going to bode well for us as rates continue to rise but really reflects the changing funding structure of this organization and we think theres a lot of optionality for us out there today that wasnt necessarily prevalent a few years ago as to how we fund this balance sheet without having some of the negative impacts in nim that maybe we have historically seen ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp and steven the only thing ill add to that on our business deposits the new account openings traditionally over of loan deposits come in as noninterest bearing deposits and theyre very sticky deposits thats been our focus of growth on a depository side steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp maybe one more tidbit that will help looking forward keep in mind when you use loan to deposit ratio was in their cost of funds much cheaper than ours so that that provides a ready source on april a funding to help fund our loan growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful but i just want to see and so it sounds like to is the beta assumed at the growth range so to get to the upper end of the nii guide whats the beta that you would need to achieve to get to that about valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp around you have it right and the answer is around steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful okay and then thank you on that so ira i wanted to ask so if we look at the million of loans from the expansion to philly atlanta nashville those great to see banks doing what youre doing but i always go back to having covered valley for a long time your predecessor jerry would always say the only way to grow in new markets was to offer a better deal than the banks that were already there are you just offering a better deal maybe if you give some color on why you are seeing such strong growth out of this new market so quickly ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think its a differentiated approach we didnt go into these markets largely with setting up an ipo and saying were going to be out there offering the best rate in individual market as tom alluded to and maybe you can provide a little more color it was really relationship driven as following some of our new customers into there and having them really provide sort of what that introduction to some of the other borrowers in this footprints look like so the yields on those for us are right in line with the overall portfolio but i think a very different perspective as to how were looking at a growth in those markets versus maybe what some others are doing but but tom probably some more color would probably be helpful there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and ira was right we entered those markets following our good customers into those weve maintained the same margins and yields in those markets and more importantly we maintain our underwriting standards in those markets stress testing interest rates and cap rates on all the loans so were not compromising to go in either on credit standards or on return and they become deposit weve been successful in raising deposits in those markets also steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah yeah okay thanks last question for me the comment ira that you dont expect to be active in ma for traditional banks at least over the near term is that just reflective of theres not many great opportunities out there today or in the environment stuff of closed deals or is this a longer term strategic shift that youre really announcing to the market today ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think one of the things ill try to do as ceo of the organization and the boards really been supportive of is looking at ma from a strategic lever perspective we have a pretty defined approach as to how we think about growth is going to look like in this organization and from an environment perspective and theres an opportunity to layer strategic ma that really accelerates that growth is something that we prioritized over the last few transactions that weve done where historically ma what might have been how do we think about cutting costs within an acquisition and then really what is the overall organization look like so very different approach for valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 me organic growth drives valuation organic growth drives our right from an independence perspective so we need to create strategic opportunities and partly through ma to help us create organic growth i would say today theres less options out there that really provide that but the last couple of deals that weve done have really provided us amazing organic opportunities today and youre seeing that with loan growth if you go back and look at what the organic loan growth in this organization has been since i took over as ceo were our indiscernible around weve been able to do that while doing ma we created a juggernaut when it comes to organic loan growth in this organization and were really excited about what those opportunities look like for us steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so maybe think about it that theres a higher bar today for you to do a traditional bank deal than maybe what we would have thought about one or two years ago is that right ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think the bars higher but i think the type is higher which to me is more important right doing a deal where youre just looking at cost saves across an organization to me distract sort of what the opportunities are for us what is an opportunity from a strategic perspective to lever growth is something we would potentially look at but that said i think we have amazing opportunities today and its not really a huge priority for us right now steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it great thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steve operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of matthew breese from stephens your question please mattew breese q analyst stephens inc all right good morning everybody hey wanted to go to the nii guide maybe tackle this a different way throughout the course of this year i think its expected that were in a see a sequence of fed fund hikes potentially or if i were to look at nii versus nii how do you think that compares would it be towards the upper end of the guidance or the lower end the range using kind of median assumptions on your end michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i want to make sure i understand the question correctly you can see what our previous guide was which would be more related to fourth quarter at to that guide at that time did not incorporate the kind of variability that i talked about earlier related to various betas and its mostly because of the size of projected fed increases right now bps but maybe bps valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 mattew breese q analyst stephens inc correct michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and the indiscernible continuing to accelerate the number of them which could drive a higher beta potentially so we wanted to make sure that our guide included on the lower end of the guide included the potential for those higher betas to actually be reality mattew breese q analyst stephens inc got it let me try it this way with leumi what is the kind of interest rate sensitivity profile in a plus basis point environment for the combined you know for the combined organization ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah it would be approximately or positive nii impact that would be maybe asset sensitivity though but i would just mat i mean just to try and simplify it right like the guide that we gave you in january of to was based on a balance sheet and curve fast forward three months our starting position on loans is much higher and weve guided to higher loan growth and then the curve is more beneficial to our nii outlook as well so the range goes up because of those two factors the reason that the bottom end of the range i would say is expanded is because we think its prudent to provide a beta shock scenario to the degree there is additional funding pressure beyond what we anticipate so weve told you what our historical betas have been and what goes into our internal modeling but to be conservative and appropriate and give the right range of results thats what the low end of that guide captures mattew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay i did want to go back to expenses just for a moment mike you had mentioned that the core rate is million i just want to make sure when you referenced there being modest growth in the second quarter that were basing that off of million mark and could you give us some idea of that million what the all in expenses are expected to be for the second quarter kind of the baseline assumptions with leumi at that point michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i dont have the leumi numbers at my fingertips but i can answer the first part with clarity yes million is the baseline core expense number for the second quarter but exclusive of leumi ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah leumi contribute something just on a standalone basis they would contribute call it million million of expenses a quarter so obviously there are some early stage cost saves that you get that would reduce that impact valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 mattew breese q analyst stephens inc right okay okay thanks for the clarification the swap fee income how sustainable do you think that is or do you think there is a number of kind of fence jumpers that want to get into it prior to rates going higher thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah matt its tom i think there was some acceleration in the first quarter i think it will return to normalized levels which is probably that million to million a quarter mattew breese q analyst stephens inc okay okay the last one for me is this quarter were not really seeing any signs of credit deterioration across any of the northeast banks but the one area i continue to get questions on is the health of office and i was curious one could you just remind us on what your exposure is to office and then two are you seeing any sorts of signs or deterioration on that front or do you have kind of concerns with it on a goforward basis thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah i mean obviously its something that we focus on office our our office is less than of our total real estate portfolio and very little we have minimal in the manhattan high rise market most of our office portfolio is suburban nonurban and attracts more towards the growing southeast markets where were seeing any new business and any growth i just want to remind that that weve always stressed at a much higher cap rate than some of our competitors have even in the better times we do not have a large office exposure in general and its very spread out very diverse theres a point of contact to our average loan in our for our new business for first quarter average real estate loan was million with a weighted average ltv so we continue to grow in a very granular fashion of our new business production was with existing customers so we get a lot of repeat business from people that have been through these cycles but what were very conscious of whats going on in the office space and very careful in how we proceed there mattew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay thats all i had thank you for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave bishop from hovde group your question please david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 yeah good morning gentlemen maybe keeping along the credit lines i know its a rather a modest pickup but a little bit of hiccup or pickup in the early stage delinquencies the narrative noted two loans just maybe any sort of granularity you can provide in terms of those inputs thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure david its tom here is about a million pickup and that piece million of that is administrative and theyre in a process of being removed there were two real estate loans that are paying both slow pay one has at ltv at below the other has it ltv in the range both are well collateralized it again we stressed our cap rates and we underwrite with cap rates that were much higher than i would say our competitors have so we dont expect any losses david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it and then maybe one final question in terms of new money yields on new originations this quarter just curious how that compares to origination yields in the fourth quarter thanks thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey dave so total origination yields increased basis points during the quarter i would tell you as we exited march i mean those origination yields ticked up even further and there just theres a chart on our loan page the bottom left chart will show you origination yields over the last couple of quarters just to put that in context ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah thats on slide at the bottom if you want to know the reference david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc okay great i think i missed that i appreciate that ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you this does conclude the questionandanswer session of todays program id like to hand the program back to ira robbins for any further remarks ira d robbins chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you i just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us today and
