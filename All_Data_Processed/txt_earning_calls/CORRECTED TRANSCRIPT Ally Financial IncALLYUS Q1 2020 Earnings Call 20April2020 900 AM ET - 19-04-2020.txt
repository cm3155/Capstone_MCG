quickly expanded our benefits in late march with the emphasis on health and family care and provided a financial assistance payment for employees who make under for our customers we were proud to lead the industry and rolling out comprehensive relief bringing increased financial flexibility and added security during an uncertain time for many jenn will walk through the details in a few moments but the overall participation rates sentiment scores and nps levels reinforce for us that our customers recognize our efforts to do it right our commitment to them in this environment will ultimately strengthen relationships and mitigate losses down the line we were not mandated to take these actions but there is no playbook to navigate an environment like we ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 face this is a time when your values serve as your guiding principles for our dealers we were proud to offer payment relief and launch an sba offering under the payroll protection plan program in a matter of a few days we stood up a capability that allowed us to submit nearly applications on behalf of our dealer customers at ally bank our direct digital platform that has generated consecutive years of customer expansion and deposit growth saw record mobile app downloads during march remaining true to our brand we waived a variety of charges across our deposit and invest offerings until july of this year this includes deposit overdraft fees and payment deferral options in our mortgage product which weve never been reliant on overly burdensome customer fees were energized by the overwhelmingly positive responses we received from customers via social platforms call centers and direct communications to myself and hundreds of our teammates for our communities we recognize this is a moment in society where the private sector has to play a role and companies like ally need to step up and do more weve jumped at the opportunity to increase our giving kludging million in financial aid to deserving charities focused on housing health education food and economic development across each of these areas our actions continue to be guided by our customercentric philosophy in do it right approach ill briefly review results for the quarter on slide number similar to the past few years began with strong financial and operating trajectories while building momentum and ongoing improvement across key metrics while we dont know how long the shutdown will last or what the specific impacts will be on broad base economic activities we are confident ally is wellpositioned to navigate the cycle supporting our customers enhancing loyalty and driving incremental growth opportunities in the longterm financial results for the first quarter reflects higher provision for credit losses including a reserve increase of over times the prior quarter level reflecting cecl day and anticipating covid19 impacts adjusted eps was negative and core rotce was negative total revenue exceeded billion for the third consecutive quarter a increase yearoveryear in auto we originated billion of loans and leases during the quarter while decisioning million applications through january and february application volume was higher compared to but declined for the quarter reflecting a meaningful slowdown in march activity new originated auto yields were during the quarter ncos increased yearoveryear to with minimal impact from covid19 in the quarter we are continually assessing market dynamics and competitive behaviors while maintaining disciplined underwriting standards while also remaining focused on potential opportunities to further support our customers within insurance we underwrote million of premiums representing our highest first quarter result and demonstrating the meaningful progress weve made expanding our reach turning to deposits we ended the quarter with over billion in balances an increase of billion yearover year through strong net growth every month during the quarter we added new deposit customers in the quarter driving us to over million total depositors the steady balance growth and consistent customer trends demonstrate the resilience of our platform the stability in our funding profile and the intrinsic value of our brand all critically important as we head into a challenging economy this should also provide clear illustration of the robust funding machine that exists at our company many others in our industries dont have the robust liquidity posture that exists at ally this is a dramatic improvement of our company relative to the crisis in and within our consumer and commercial product lines ally home and ally invest observed technical difficulty ally home directtoconsumer originations of million reflected ongoing awareness of our offering as the environment drove a strong refinance pipeline for ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 invest accounts grew at the highest and fastest pace in over four years under the ally brand and having this capability served as a customer and balance retention tool for ally we captured nearly million of balance transfers from our deposit platform that could have otherwise ended up outside of ally ally lending volume was million in the quarter increasing quarteroverquarter and corporate finance balances grew primarily as a result of increased line draw activity in early april weve seen a significant slowdown in additional line draws from a capital perspective we proactively suspended share buybacks through the end of the second quarter given the events unfolding in the macro environment and we submitted our capital plan as part of the ccar cycle in early april regarding the cardworks acquisition we began our integration work and filed for regulatory approval on schedule we continue to remain in dialogue with don and the team on operational and business trends while we obviously did not anticipate the rapid economic changes when we announced the deal two months ago the longterm benefits of the acquisition remain unchanged i know certain provisions of the deal are on your minds and it is hard to say much at this time what we can continue to promise is that we will make the right decisions for our customers and shareholders for the long run cardworks longterm track record will serve as an important differentiator in this environment as we shared when we announced the deal cardworks had successfully navigated many cycles across its 32year history and thrive following the last cycle we recognize this environment is a different animal but we know the quality of this business and these operators on slide number are the key metrics weve highlighted for several years that we believe provide important short term and longterm context across allys performance and inherent value while the eps result in the upper left is not something were satisfied with this reflects actions were taking to build reserves and to position for expected losses related to covid19 this shortterm metric should be looked at in conjunction with tangible book value trends shown in the bottom right to gain a broader perspective of the inherent franchise value and longterm trends weve grown book value yearoveryear to even as capital levels remained steady reserves increased times since yearend through cecl implementation and absorbing the resulting net loss in q1 weve included cecls day proforma impact as added context revenues in the upper right remained strong this quarter in many aspects of our embedded balance sheet positioning remain intact deposits on the bottom left increased at over billion and now represents of our funding base as i mentioned a few moments ago we are well positioned to execute in the uncertain environment and believe well be rewarded by our customers over the longterm our management team is more focused than ever on the risks in front of us while actively looking for new opportunities to innovate for our customers and build upon our momentum with that ill turn it over to jenn to take you through the detailed financial results jennifer laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb and good morning everyone id like to start by echoing the deep gratitude for those working on the frontlines to serve and protect us during this critical time id also like to recognize our employees who have shown strong dedication and resolve over the past six weeks rising to the occasion both personally and professionally on behalf of our company customers and communities im proud of our people and proud to be part of the team with that lets start then on slide as youre aware there are many unknowns in our current environment including the length of the shutdown unemployment levels gdp deterioration and consumer and business ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 confidence ally along with many others is challenged to accurately project the impacts on many key aspects of our business despite this and in the spirit of providing transparency weve laid out a variety of insights into what were currently experiencing and expecting as we move forward this year these insights are based on what we know today and we recognize and expect many variables will continue to evolve as jb alluded to january and february results were strong and continue to demonstrate growing momentum beginning midmarch the economic shutdown was immediately felt across our business lines resulting in declines across several areas but also increases in our digital channels including ally home and ally invest in auto reduced activity at dealerships lowered app volume and originations by over by late march which we would expect to continue in line with the shelterinplace orders over time as the economy improves well be positioned to act swiftly on opportunities including a potential increase in demand for used prudently stepping in where others may have exited providing adaptable solutions as we did with the expanded carvana floor program and the sba product launch for our dealers where weve funded virtually of our applications prior to the program shutdown last thursday in deposits customer growth and retention remained strong and we expect that to continue throughout we have the second highest customer growth for our first quarter and retention rates remained at in addition to the growing preference for digital ally continues to gain momentum with brand recognition at alltime highs we also grew in spite of increased transfers to brokers reflecting equity market volatility but captured nearly of the outflows at invest we remain balanced in our deposit pricing decisions throughout as were mindful of market rates competitor actions and alternative funding opportunities ally home saw elevated volume in march and early april due to refinance demand we expect the shelterinplace provisions will reduce demand for purchase volumes which have already started to decline in various areas of the country managing credit risk remains a top priority for us and we know youre focused on this topic as well while we are not yet seeing deteriorating impact on our credit performance weve already adjusted our servicing strategies real time including the rollout of augmented staffing capacity increased customer outreach and enhanced digital engagement our reserve levels are over times the level they were at yearend reflecting lifeofloss cecl implementation and a deteriorating macroeconomic forecast including elevated unemployment approaching and significant gdp decline we run a variety of economic scenarios on a regular basis to inform decisions and to ensure we have line of sight into various outcomes we implemented cecl as scheduled this quarter which as we discussed in q4 reflects a month reasonable and supportable forecast period and include the macroeconomic data in our historic mean ill cover more on our reserves momentarily we expect retail ncos at to this year reflecting our current macroeconomic assumptions with the ultimate outcome dependent on how the environment unfold as a reference our ccar modeling implies retail ncos rise to to reflecting a persistent broadbased macroeconomic deterioration the stimulus checks are likely to have a positive impact of credit performance as polling has shown the number one expected use of additional funds is to pay down debt or bills within our reserves we have not embedded any stimulus benefit at this time moving to the bottom section we remain in constructive dialogue with our regulators keeping them apprised of trends were seeing the fiscal and monetary actions taken by congress and the fed are providing critical cash ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 for americans and necessary liquidity for the broader markets ally does not have any outstanding discount window draws however we believe this is an efficient and rational mechanism for banks to access liquidity we applaud the regulatory community for broad and sweeping actions taken to support the us economy and as you are aware we withdrew our financial outlook earlier this month while we are experiencing nearterm earnings headwinds as jb touched on a moment ago the current environment will not impact our longterm strategies and value our balance sheet remains strong with sufficient capital funding and liquidity which ill cover more on in a moment for broadly we expect revenue trends to reflect the rate environment and moderating originations due to the shutdown as we discussed credit charges and reserve levels are based on what we know today which we will continue to monitor and adjust as conditions unfold on expenses while we continue to invest in areas that will enhance our company over the longterm we are active in identifying and reducing discretionary spend across the company the next two slides provide additional context around how we are positioned heading into this downturn so lets turn to slide the multiyear transformation of our funding profile and improved liquidity position are evidenced through these charts wholesale funding has been replaced by deposits providing increased stability and lower funding costs these trends will continue although we will opportunistically access wholesale markets from time to time as we did in early april with our first unsecured issuance as an investmentgrade company our liquidity position highlights allys ability to withstand adverse changes in the broader environment and demonstrate significant growth and liquidity over the past several years over of our availableforsale portfolio is in highly liquid securities ensuring we have significant flexibility and we continue to have access to unused capacity at the fhlb turning to slide our cet1 levels have remained consistent and above our target over the last several years as weve efficiently deployed capital through balance sheet expansion and direct shareholder distribution for context we remain substantially above our minimum capital levels and modeled ccar scenarios incorporating stress assumptions and ongoing dividend payments while were not inferring events to unfold exactly as prior stress scenarios imply this provides insight into our capital preparedness and ability to withstand a severe prolonged downturn allowance for loan losses grew to billion or of loan balances representing the highest loss absorption capacity in the history of our company as we head into a downturn we have built a strong foundation which will ensure ally stands ready to support our customers through all of our banking products on slide well walk through our first quarter financial results net financing revenue excluding oid of billion declined linked quarter million and increased yearoveryear by million the decline versus prior quarter was primarily driven by nonrecurring revenue retiming items related to the conversion of our retail auto servicing system as you would expect when converting a large asset base to a new system there were some minor timing differences in certain calculations but these variances will neutralize over the life of the asset excluding this item underlying trends continue this quarter where auto portfolio yields increased while deposit costs declined adjusted other revenue of million remained elevated this quarter reflecting strong investment gains and expanded mortgage fee income provision expense of million reflected reserve build activity related to covid19 noninterest expense increased by million linked quarter and million compared to the prior year increases versus prior quarter were largely due to compensation seasonality and certain covid19 related employee benefits compared to prior year drivers included items that should be familiar to you including volume and revenue based activities reflecting our growing customer base and insurance related expenses commensurate with ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 written premium growth investments in our brands and techs capabilities and expenses from our expanded consumer products including ally lending onboarded late last year as i discussed earlier we expect to continue prudently investing in our company but expenses will grow at a slower pace as we reduce discretionary spend given the material change in our operating environment the metrics at the bottom reflect impacts of our large reserve build during this quarter lets turn to slide from an industry perspective benchmark rates this quarter touched alltime lows across many tenors including a basis point reduction by the federal reserve to support the broader economy the combination of these events has resulted in a persistently flat forward curve to reduce earnings volatility weve managed to a relatively neutral interest rate position for some time including our nim relative to more asset sensitive balance sheet however the flat shape of the curve will weigh on margin expansion turning to the quarter net interest margin excluding oid was relatively stable at this included a basis point reduction to consolidated nim and an basis point reduction to retail auto yield due to the system conversion i just mentioned yearoveryear average earning assets remained stable at billion as we expanded across every line item except commercial auto where inventory levels were lower yearoveryear notably this trend reversed in late march due to lower sales where industry days supply jumped by days to days overall we are observing downward trends in april which is likely to continue as oem production resumes looking closer at some of the line items retail auto balances will be dependent on originated volume while portfolio yields will continue expanding this year lease yields will be heavily dependent on auction lands reopening and consumer demand returning while used car value declines in the near term are primarily due to lower auction levels we believe the more relevant pricing trends will not be available until auction activities resume its normal level commercial auto balances will reflect dynamics discussed a moment ago while lower benchmarks will drive lower yields nearly of our corporate financing book has libor floors which are expected to mitigate the impact of lower market rate mortgage balances will grow in q2 reflecting strong refinance volumes given historically low mortgage rates turning to liabilities cost of funds continue to improve this quarter down basis points linkedquarter and basis points yearoveryear these trends are fueled by deposits which we cover on the next slide deposit expansion continued this quarter ending at billion retail deposits grew by billion despite record outflows to brokerages that exceeded full year level we retained a third of these outflows at invest testament to the retention value of the platform other than that in addition to capturing outflows and experiencing record selfdirected trading activity we garnered several industry awards and leading reviews we also launched a suite of deposit savings tools for our customers designed to increase customers ability to plan allocate and grow their savings in the bottom left retail deposit rates declined basis points linkedquarter and have fallen basis points yearoveryear competitive dynamics reflect the uncertain outlook on consumers but we are well positioned to remain thoughtful and disciplined around pricing and growth we added customers surpassing the million mark this quarter an important milestone for us and our industry leading customer retention levels remained at lets turn to capital and shareholder distributions on slide cet1 was in q1 in line with our recent trends we elected to defer capital related impacts associated with cecl for two years per guidance provided by the federal reserve we repurchased million shares before suspending the repurchase program through the end of the second quarter ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 last week our board of directors approved an q2 dividend of per share payable on may we completed our ccar process during the quarter and submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve in early april we remain in regular dialogue with the fed navigating the potential implications with the cardworks acquisition on our capital plan including implementation of the scb final rule effective october asset quality details are on slide consolidated net chargeoff of basis points this quarter increased basis points yearoveryear reflecting retail auto activity in the upper right net charge off of million increased million compared to the prior year driven by increasing auto loan balances and ongoing seasoning of the portfolio including a higher used mix in the bottom left retail auto net chargeoffs were up basis points yearoveryear in line with our expectations while we expect the deteriorating environment to drive this metric higher moving forward covid19 impacts were immaterial in q1 looking at delinquency trends in the bottom right 60plus increased basis points yearoveryear and 30plus increased basis points over the same period in the far right weve highlighted the balance impact of the customers participating in the payment deferral program these populations fall under unique accounting treatment where participating customers are effectively present in their status for the duration of the deferral this unique population resulted in increased reported delinquencies yearoveryear as these accounts do not follow the normal flowtobetter and flowtoloss trends these dynamics will also impact reported net chargeoff rates in future periods while we know this will make it difficult to rely on these metrics as we have in the past two key points to keep in mind first our allowance levels contemplate consumers willingness and ability to pay regardless of forbearance participation and second we believe these programs will help mitigate future losses across our portfolio and within our securitizations as we work to find solutions to keep our customers paying for and in their cars slide provides additional detail on reserve levels and cecl on the top half of the page weve highlighted the significant increase in reserves and coverage levels resulting from cecl implementations and the forecasted macroeconomic deterioration related to covid19 the consolidated trends are driven primarily by increases in the retail order book with coverage of overall reserve balances shown on the bottom reflect similar drivers moving to slide weve provided a summary of the deferral program for retail auto customers over million auto customers elected to participate in our deferral program as of april the vast majority of this population where have never had an extension while have never been delinquent with ally we believe participation in this program will lower loss content due to the additional time and flexibility we are providing to our customers in addition we are increasing our customer servicing support employing use of additional techniques and readiness tools to maintain line of sight into their ability to pay and to provide a seamless transition to resuming payments at the end of the program we will be able to track leading indicators of default and intervene early with loss mitigating actions to help keep our customers on track with their payments we are encouraged by the positive customer responses and believe our approach reinforces our values during this time of uncertainty and keeps ally top of mind on slide weve included detailed auto financial results for the quarter much of this has been covered through prior content but i will highlight a few additional items net financing revenue grew yearoveryear even as commercial balances declined driving endofperiod earning asset levels lower overall in the bottom right ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 estimated retail new origination yields remained well above for the eighth consecutive quarters this will drive the portfolio yield higher throughout beyond our retail relief program we are offering lease flexibility and meaningful support for dealers to support their businesses of dealers are using some form of relief weve offered additionally in the paycheck protection program offering we rolled out we funded essentially all applicants representing over million in loans secured turning to auto metrics on slide q1 originations of billion quarteroverquarter average fico remain steady at while nonprime volume declined slightly to moving to the bottom left consumer assets grew yearoveryear to billion across the loan and lease categories and looking at commercial assets on the bottom right average balances declined billion compared to the prior year reflecting lower dealer inventory levels insurance segment results on slide core pretax income of million in q1 was down million linked quarter and million yearoveryear primarily driven by higher losses including weather related expenses underwriting income excluding losses was essentially flat yearoveryear as increased vsc and gaap revenue was offset by the impact of lower floorplan inventory levels written premiums of million grew million yearoveryear and represented our strongest first quarter level slide has our corporate finance segment results core pretax loss of million was driven by million of reserve build during the quarter primarily related to the estimated potential impact of covid19 pending assets grew million during the quarter and billion yearoveryear which included million of elevated draws on revolving lines of credit as borrowers thought to boost liquidity draw activity moderated significantly in late march and into april we have been working directly with our individual borrowers most of which will be impacted in some manner in the coming months we believe the portfolio remained strong considering of the book is assetbased the strong positioning of our loans and the capital structure the significant equity investments of our supporting sponsors and the solid business value proposition of our borrowers lastly we have no direct oil and gas exposure in our book on slide mortgage pretax income of million this quarter increased million versus prior quarter and was essentially flat yearoveryear elevated prepayments drove asset levels down and resulted in higher premium amortization expense origination volume was strong as ally leveraged its existing customer base and leading digital capabilities through our partnership with bettercom ill close by reiterating my support of our ally teammates who are the driving force behind the strength of our company i recognize this is a difficult time for many but im confident we will navigate and succeed together we will continue positioning the company for the future focusing on doing it right for our customers and communities and delivering longterm value for our shareholders and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you jenn on slide number i have included perspectives on the environment were operating in today and how ally will steer through the uncertainty the sudden and severe nature of this shutdown has affected the world and our nation in a manner that is arguably never been replicated on a scale of this magnitude it is within this context that i think its important to acknowledge that significant action across public and private sectors is ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 necessary and should continue on a size and scale that has not been seen in modern history to directly address the outbreak that is already having negative impacts on workers consumers and citizens across america while some positive trends are emerging in regard to the spread of the virus we still do not know how long it will take to return to a state of normalcy at ally youve heard throughout our remarks this morning and as long as i have been in the chair we are relentlessly focused on our customers weve built a strong and vibrant culture around this mantra and today were even more emboldened to act in accordance with these principles this provides clarity for our customers and purpose for our teammates in a time of great uncertainty and were confident it will ultimately drive longterm shareholder value we entered the current environment with a strong wellpositioned balance sheet with funding capital and liquidity position to serve as sources of strength weve grown our auto and deposit offerings into dominant adaptable franchises ready to continue delivering for our customers while actively seeking new opportunities to expand the headwinds we will experience in the nearterm while admittedly challenging will not impact our ability to deliver on our longterm strategies and visions ill wrap up on slide number we take great pride in being a comprehensive adaptive and digitallyfocused consumer and commercial finance provider we are focused on leveraging expertise and our history to build a stronger company for the future including disciplined risk management and purposeful capital management thank you to our associates i am proud of your ability to rise to the occasion doing it right in every interaction with our customers within our communities and on behalf of our shareholders and with that daniel back to you and i think were going to take some brief qa daniel eller executive directorinvestor relations ally financial inc yeah great thanks jb so we would ask participants as we head into qa to limit yourself to one question and one followup operator please begin the qa session ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is now open moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks im hoping that you could kind of expand a little bit on the process i know you talked about the assumed loss rate you said that youve got a very significant percentage of your customers that are in deferral but you also said that you werent relying on the stimulus so could you kind of talk to us about how those customers actually go through the process and what we should be looking to see that would help validate the assumptions that you made jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure good morning moshe yeah sure let me just jump in on our reserve process and how it relates to our deferral population so as we went through the reserving this quarter we have essentially modeled it per our macroeconomic forecast and looked at historic relations and willingness and ability to pay for our overall customer base we have not at this time included any of what we think will be a net positive benefit from the forbearance programs that weve rolled out to our populations or even the stimulus impact that our customers are likely to benefit from so we kept the processes separate we think in that way that our reserves are fairly balanced and well continue to very closely monitor that population in the forbearance program were going to do that through quantitative means as well as through qualitative measures as were increasing both human and digital outreach to those customers moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay and maybe as a followup could you talk a little bit about the outlook for deposit pricing obviously your growth in deposits has been strong and youre likely to see now that the wave of drawdowns on corporate finance lines has crested that probably youre going to see ph bound asset levels falling so could you talk a little bit about deposit pricing as we go into q2 and back half of the year jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure moshe i mean the bottomline here is we do see opportunity to continue to look at deposit pricing and bring it down over time especially when you look at where rates are today now were taking a very balanced approach we want to make sure that we emerge from this crisis in a position of strength and were positioned to grow our balance sheet appropriately with funding available and once you turn the machine off it can be harder to turn it back on but if you just look at kind of the trends that were seeing on our balance sheet we are expecting asset levels to come down a bit our loantodeposit ratios are approaching and we continue to see just based on our funding needs as well as where rates are that there will be opportunity to take down pricing and as we always do well be thoughtful around managing customer value competitive rates and our funding needs on the balance sheet ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you so much moshe operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for the call this morning two questions ill start with one just on the forbearance you gave a lot of numbers around the forbearance impact on the dqs could you just remind us the forbearance percentages of outstanding balances that youve been getting requests for on both the consumer side as well as on the corporate side the dealer side jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure good morning betsy so if you look at our forbearance population starting first within retail at million customers its about of our accounts a little bit higher than that in terms of the balances keep in mind with this population we were very proactive and you see across the industry a number of reactive offers we were proactive we actually went out and emailed our customers and offered them the opportunity to have more payment flexibility so we do think that this position us from a brand and loyalty perspective and doing it right approach positions us incredibly strongly on the commercial side we have about or so of our dealerships that are taking advantage of payment deferral thats one of the programs weve provided we are also offering them the ppp program through the sba if you think about a couple of weeks ago we werent even an sba lender we were able to process applications an upward of about million in funded loans for dealers in that regard as well and the whole intention here is i think as jb pointed out a couple of times in his prepared remarks is really to focus on the controllable focus on keeping our market strong our customers strong and we believe thats going to position us very well on the back end of this crisis betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then just a followup here on the auction pricing that you were discussing highlighting that todays price for used cars is impacted by a very low level of participants in the auction so how do i think about how that feeds into your quarters assessment of used car prices and how you think about the remarketing gains et cetera this quarter and then what is the trigger for a better price is it a function of number of participants in your opinion or how you could help us understand how that should traject over the next few quarters jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 yeah sure its a really important area that we are focused on as you think about our leasing yields and our marketing gains what were seeing right now is essentially the market is illiquid in that physical auctions as well as the digital auctions and so its just really hard right now to determine what share pricing is we were guiding towards a negative to in used vehicle prices it could potentially go down from there its just very difficult to know at this point and so were a bit in wait and see mode and we think well have a much clearer sense of used car prices once shelterinplace orders are lifted and auction activities can resume more normal levels keep in mind we are providing lease extensions to our customers and that helps to kind of manage the supply dynamics relative to demand and we think that overall positions the market to be stronger as well but its a really important focus area for us and i think this is one of those areas to be determined as we go through the next couple of quarters betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so how did that play into numbers jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so first quarter we didnt really see any dynamics i mean we were kind of neutral in terms of linkedquarter remarketing gains and so it hasnt yet materialized betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and i think betsy theres other potential offsets and positive catalysts out there obviously were all waiting to see what happens to public transportation and theres uber usage lyft usage subway taxi does that get negatively impacted and people have to now own transportation once again and that sector is likely the do in the former years so i mean all of these are things that weve got to balance but i think as jenns pointing out the short term dynamics are really just theyre so choppy theres no liquidity in the markets and were just trying to be very thoughtful on what this implies going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right yeah and fair point on want to own your own car thanks thanks for the color jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah thanks betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache with nomura your line is now open bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thanks good morning jb and jenn its notable that at cecl you guys were able to actually grow tangible book value per share sequentially despite the big reserve build this quarter but with your stock trading at less than of tangible book value per share i think some investors are struggling with their assessment of the downside risk to tangible book value can you offer some perspective on the historical credit performance of the allys predecessor hided losses yet in retail auto maybe discuss what changes are important to think about from a credit perspective to the business from back then versus what the business is like today and then maybe just more broadly any color that you could give us to maybe frame your confidence level and your ability to defend tangible book value under your current reasonable and supportable assumptions jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thank you for the question bill its a really good one and quite frankly we cant even get close to the valuation numbers that were seeing today and i shared with you in my prepared remarks that we would expect in a severely adverse scenario where weve got persistent broadbased macroeconomic deterioration for some time to think about kind of an l shaped economy we would expect then to hit loss levels of to today if you look at our internal modeling relative to that severely adverse scenario we are reserved at about of that here in q1 and if you look at the federal reserve modeling which is significantly more punitive especially on the commercial portfolios were about so we feel like were perfectly and kind of smartly reserved for what were experiencing today you asked about its a little bit difficult to get applesto apples just because were in a different portfolio back then but we give the ncos and retail auto hit about for a very brief period of time and then reversed back down and normalized very quickly within about six months or so but relative to relative to our severely adverse scenarios we feel like we were well reserved at this point now obviously a lot of unknowns in terms of what the shape of the economy looks like the severity of it but relative to past performance we feel that were in great shape now i mean on your confidence question on reasonable and supportable i mean this is the question that is trying to be answered across macroeconomists at the end of march we had built in kind of what we think of a unemployment approaching gdp declining by it has kind of deteriorated a little bit since then in april were at kind of but there is a lot of ins and outs on our reserves moshe had asked the question on the forbearance program none of the benefit of that is built into our reserves we are expecting our balance sheet to come down and thatll give some offset to reserve build as well so i think our overall confidence is about as high as it can be right now and well continue to manage and monitor it as we go into q2 and beyond ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc the only thing i would add bill and jenn covered it perfectly but i mean if you if you think about the billion billion discount to book i mean theres not really a conceivable scenario that models that out so its been a sudden and aggressive move down and we think through time and through our performance that will recover but that gives us a lot of confidence of upside to come bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thats super helpful thank you if i could just sneak in a quick followup on your cardworks comments is it possible to discuss whether the seller is considering his option to walk away from the deal and whether ally would be willing to incur the additional dilution to compel them to close the deal or maybe just a little bit little bit more to the extent that you can offer us a little bit more color jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah id just say im not going to really comment right now i mean were in the process as i said in the prepared remarks obviously don and his team and certainly ally and our team didnt expect the severe drop off or fall off in the economy to come so were going through the process now well make the right decisions on both sides that are thoughtful for our shareholders and our customers for the longterm so thats really all we can say bill carcache q analyst nomura instinet thank you very much appreciate you taking the questions jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks bill jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks bill operator thank you our next question comes from rick shane with jp morgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning jenn in response to betsys question you talked about the store or the prior assumption of a to decline in used car prices when you look at your and i appreciate the fact you guys have provided an update on nco guidance what are you thinking in terms of higher loss frequency and higher loss severity jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 yeah so within our reserves and within that implied to retail auto nco rick we have embedded that we would have more material kind of likely pressure on the severity side as well as higher delinquency its just pulling in past correlations that we have seen so think about thats kind of already embedded into that reserve calculation and in terms of just what happens with the lease portfolio with respect to yields i think thats the question that were going to have to answer over the next couple of months and quarters as used vehicle volume and demand starts to come back as shelterinplace orders are lifted over time but thats largely embedded in that severity go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan so to you put a fine point on this you increased your severity assumption which makes sense but you have not explicitly changed your used car price assumptions youve just sort of generally assumed that severities are going to go up jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thats a good way to look at it i mean the point if youre assuming higher credit losses its going to be a combination of frequency and severity and whether or not that plays out exactly we will see and at some point it will merge with overall used car prices and well continue to update it when we have more actual data coming out of our auctions richard shane q analyst jpmorgan okay great thank you so much jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you rick operator thank you and our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning appreciate all the commentary on reserves just a couple of clarifications one inside your cecl window are you assuming any type of economic recovery and then some of the banks that have reported up until now have talked about how the macro forecast have gotten weaker since quarter end relative to that unemployment rate so how should we think about future provision build and that assumption i dont know what your views are in terms of that jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure good morning sanjay so as we modeled reserves keep in mind it was kind of end of march time period and the forecast that we had is more kind of a vshape than an lshape or ushape at this point in time so we do have a bit of a recovery starting in q3 and accelerating into q4 ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2020 now that being said we have not modeled in any of the potential benefits from stimulus or from our forbearance programs which are providing a lot more cash flow and flexibility around payments to our customers and so we believe that overall will be a net positive not included in our numbers and also keep in mind that the size of our balance sheet is likely to go down which in a cecl world provides outside benefit as you move through the quarter so we got to take a balanced view the macroeconomic impact will materialize potentially as we go through q2 but therere some natural offsets there as well so overall we feel like were in a good position with our current reserve number richard shane q analyst jpmorgan okay and then i guess when i think about cardworks i know you cant really speak to whether or not that deal will be consummated it assumes like you guys are assuming it will when we talked about the deal and sort of the profitability of that business during the financial crisis it was break even i think at its worst in the end at the worst point in this backdrop with the accounting being what it is with cecl should we expect worse than that could you just help us think through the implications on profitability for cardworks assuming the unemployment rates you are jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean sanjay look i think cardworks is similar to every other financial services industry right now theyre focusing on controllables what can they do to help their customers theyre monitoring things very closely as a first quarter nothing has materialized relative to covid19 and so its just really hard to say exactly how this is going to play out and i think jb said it perfectly were in constant dialogue with that team we have a lot of confidence and their ability to navigate cycles based on over the past years and well continue to monitor and partner with them but at this time its just a little bit too early to be decisive on what exactly their profitability is going to look like i mean its difficult for us to do that for ally as well keep in mind sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right great thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you sanjay operator thank you and our next question comes from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is now open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thanks just a followup on some of the
