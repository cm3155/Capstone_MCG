schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 walter w bettinger ii cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thanks jeff and good morning everyone thanks for joining us for our january business update were here in frigid westlake texas where i think it was degrees when i hopped in the vehicle this morning to come to the office but happy new year and again thank you all for joining us so as we close the book on and begin thinking about it seems like a natural time to reflect on the year that just closed it was certainly a challenging year for our clients for our stockholders and for us and perhaps it was the most challenging in my time at schwab certainly the most challenging since the bursting of the internet bubble in and yet at the same time i couldnt be more excited about the opportunities before us in youre going to see an emphasis on execution but with consistency around our strong client fundamentals and strategy i recognize that is going to be a transition year from a financial standpoint albeit one with steadily improving financial results throughout the year and a very strong exit into its unrealistic to think that the challenges of simply disappear because the calendar flips over but when i look ahead to and im quite confident that the power of our client franchise is going to shine in terms of financial results theres much work to do in and beyond and no one at schwab is kidding themselves that everything is perfect right now but my confidence is high im incredibly encouraged by what i see whether its our positioning our client relationships the solutions that we offer our clients or the focus of the entire organization on the future if i could take you back in time to the mid2000 that was a period when chuck first began speaking with me about the possibility of becoming ceo someday and as a result of those discussions i went on a listening tour of former very senior executives of schwab my goal was simply to ask them their views on the firm and our prospects for the future its important to keep in mind that many of them had been let go or terminated in the turmoil that followed the internet bubble bursting theyd experienced this incredible run up in the value of the firm followed by the pain of multiple rounds of employee layoffs and a stock price that had collapsed from the to mere single digits and although each of them used different words they all basically said the same thing they were fearful that schwabs best days were in the past i tried to absorb their counsel and their feedback objectively of course i was balancing the personal challenges that they had each been through as i listened to their feedback but i fundamentally did not believe that the firms best days were in the past there were far too many strengths for me to believe that and over a few years with a lot of hard work by many people i believe its pretty clear that we proved them wrong as our stock price grew over tenfold and assets the clients entrusted us with grew similarly i understand that today there are some who might be asking similar questions but i am confident that our best days are ahead of us in my opinion after four decades in this business there is no firm better positioned for the future no firm has our breadth of client solutions investing trading custody advisory workplace and all delivered with an incredible value for investors and advisors i expect us to make steady progress in both client flows and financial performance throughout this upcoming year and then i fully expect us to deliver outstanding results over the following years so lets go ahead and dig into it was a year of many twists and turns for our investor clients as well as for our stockholders and all the while we made substantial progress on the largest acquisitionrelated conversion in the history of our industry coming off a difficult for investors the first quarter of began with turmoil in the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 the regional banking world investor sentiment bounced between negative and positive throughout the year before eventually ending quite positive equity returns were strong in although largely concentrated in a modest number of stocks for schwab stockholders it was a difficult year our stock lost about of its value the core reasoning behind most of this decline is our commitment to proactively following our through clients eyes strategy because throughout and we reached out to our clients and encouraged them to move their yieldsensitive or what we sometimes refer to as longerterm investment cash into higheryielding alternatives and they did to the tune of several hundred billion dollars and as an aside although these actions have temporarily impacted our revenue and earnings we would do the same thing every time the client loyalty that we build by being proactive will pay dividends in the longterm as clients continue to entrust us with their investment dollars progress on the ameritrade conversion was exceptional with about of the client accounts and assets all accurately and successfully converted and despite the substantial focus on this effort we continued to make real progress on other clientrelated initiatives and helped set the table for future organic growth lets go ahead on this slide and take a deeper look into from the lens of our investor clients the open market committee of the federal reserve continued to recover from the mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint they raised rates multiple times in before peaking at close to as inflation began to ease directionally toward the feds longterm goal of and although equity markets continued to be volatile ultimate returns were actually quite strong with the sp rising over and the nasdaq composite increasing over investor sentiment was also volatile throughout recovered rather dramatically in the fourth quarter of the year from a strong bear sentiment in the third quarter and ended the year with a solid bullish viewpoint but despite this mixed sentiment our clients remained highly engaged with the markets and with schwab clients were net purchasers of equities last year by a to ratio and although trading activity was about lower than in it was still much higher than prepandemic levels and net flows into our retail advisory solutions with a very strong billion last year was a solid year in terms of client flows for our firm particularly given the volatility of the markets and the negative sentiment that existed throughout much of the year core net new assets were slightly above billion and core net new assets from clients who originally opened their accounts with schwab were about billion higher the difference of course reflecting the attrition from certain former ameritrade clients now in terms of the ameritrade conversion weve converted approximately of the accounts and assets that totals about trillion in assets and million accounts and well convert the balance in may of this year theres no question that this conversion has been a success attrition continues to track below the estimates that we shared in when the transaction was announced of course we hate losing any clients but were realistic that some attrition is to be expected and also knowing that we would be proactively stepping away from serving certain former ameritrade clients for a variety of logical reasons stepping back a bit to look at the bigger picture we are committed to our through clients eyes strategy and it underlines our no tradeoffs execution we believe the backbone of organic growth is delivered by focusing on four areas value service transparency and trust with both our clients as well as our prospects now the ultimate measure of value for clients is the balance between the quality of service and guidance they receive and the the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 revenue we earn that pays for this service and guidance and we dont believe any investment services firm delivers a better value than schwab the quality of our service is well recognized and im going to go ahead and speak on that a little bit more momentarily and the revenue we earn averages less than onequarter of in fact weve almost halved what clients pay us in one form or another over the past years and when you compare that to what investors pay certain wirehouses or independent broker dealers or regionals schwab clients pay between approximately half or even in some cases close to a quarter of what they pay these other firms now that difference adds up to an enormous drag on client wealth creation over the years its one of the key structural advantages that clients of charles schwab benefit from and weve been recognized for many years as a leader in client service in the financial services world and despite the complexities inherent in the ameritrade conversion we retained our worldclass results in for client service our net promoter score in our retail business remained in the mid while our overall speed to answer phone calls was about seconds with retail averaging just below seconds last year now these metrics are very important as our reputation for service and creating client loyalty extends across all of our clientfacing businesses delivering worldclass service is a neverending area of emphasis requires training investment in digital and selfservice capabilities as well as a philosophical deep belief in the nobility of service service has always been at the core of our success at schwab and will always remain so transparency is also a hallmark of schwab whether it be defined as our open architecture approach to investing the clarity of any fees or charges assessed to our clients or the fact that weve been a leader in both guaranteeing the security of our clients assets as well as their overall satisfaction our satisfaction guarantee is unique across the industry its provided our clients with the confidence they deserve as they make investment decisions and although the payments weve historically made under this satisfaction guarantee are relatively modest we believe deeply in the philosophy of guaranteeing our clients delight with our services and guidance we often say at schwab that we are less in the investment business than we are in the trust business and this was never more true than in as clients wanted to access their client cash that we held at our banks we ensured they had ample liquidity to move that cash into money market funds bonds treasuries or other investments and while this happened more quickly than we would have expected given the unparalleled pace of fed rate moves our contingency plans worked as designed to ensure that we could always be there to support our clients and as a result during a period of heightened concern about bank stability across the industry last spring our clients were able to have confidence in schwab were honored that both jd power and investors business daily gave our firm and our bank the highest scores in the areas of investor satisfaction and trust respectively last year and were committed to maintaining and building trust with our clients in the years to come now before i turn it over to rick i want to take a moment to remind everyone that our strategies our philosophies and our execution at schwab are not random we evaluate everything we do by screening it through a series of lens that apply our experience and knowledge about the investing industry both today as well as where its headed in the future we categorize these viewpoints into three buckets and they may look familiar to those of you whove dialed into our calls in the past broad trends client views and the competitive landscape if i were to highlight the viewpoints on these three buckets it would be first we are ideally positioned to benefit from growth in the areas of the industry that have grown the fastest in recent years and project the most organic the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 growth potential for the future selfdirected investors and traders ria serving as a fiduciary to their clients and lowcost taxaware investing next clients are looking for firms that offer a breadth of solutions that are personalized for them and make sense within the context of a financial plan ideally firms should be able to assist clients with both sides of their balance sheet investing and borrowing we believe the future will be won by firms to find the right balance between offering digital and mobile efficiency on par with nonfinancial services experience and of course paired with access to welltrained and credentials credentialed professionals not surprising given our viewpoints we believe schwab is optimally positioned for longterm organic growth rick let me turn it over to you richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thank you walt and good morning everyone schwab is in a position of strength to deliver on the client expectations that walt just spoke about ill spend our time together this morning talking about how we delivered for clients in within the strategic focus areas that you see on this page ill also share more about the investments were making to continue building on our strong foundation so we can do even more to help our current and future clients to meet their financial goals which in turn will bolster our organic growth and our competitive positioning ill start with scale and efficiency our number one priority in was to execute the largest integration in the history of the industry and it has been a tremendous success as walt highlighted we brought about of ameritrade clients to schwab representing trillion in converted assets ria firms and million total converted accounts while clients are getting used to navigating a new experience and a different way of doing things they are also seeing the breadth of capabilities on our combined platform we also focused in on reducing expenses we captured approximately million in annual run rate expense savings through streamlining our operating model which included position eliminations from predominantly nonclientfacing areas as well as reducing our real estate footprint the remaining million in ameritrade expense synergies will be realized in the second half of following the completion of the integration when we think about winwin monetization we think about meeting more of our clients total financial needs including more holistic solutions lending capabilities and access to high quality fairly priced products this attracts and retains client assets and at the same time improves our economics we generated strong results on our advised business with a yearoveryear increase in net advised flows including billion in net flows into our proprietary fullservice wealth management solution schwab wealth advisory this is a record for our firm wasmer schroder net flows were billion a record for the offer and a increase over the prior year and when it comes to direct indexing weve enhanced our schwab personalized indexing offer with expanded customization capabilities a new accountlevel digital dashboard and digital enrollment we launched our fully digital pledged asset line or pal for ria clients that gives advisors the ability to submit a pal application in the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 minutes and

functionality in addition we launched ameritrades irebal and model market center on schwab advisor center and are taking a measured approach to ensure a seamless onboarding experience for new irebal users with general access rolling out early this year finally we acquired the family wealth alliance to expand our capabilities to serve both singlefamily and multifamily offices as we look ahead in we will continue to focus on and make investments in our key strategic focus areas to drive our organic growth fuel our virtuous cycle and help clients achieve their financial goals one thing ill point out about this page is that given our focus on continuing to make schwab an easy place to do business we are adding a fourth pillar to our strategic focus areas called ease which is about delivering exceptional and easy experiences to our clients with million client accounts serving our clients exceptionally well will be a big driver of our organic growth when we think about scale and efficiency were laserfocused on successfully converting the final ameritrade client transition group and then capturing our remaining expense synergies well continue making investments in artificial intelligence to empower our teams to serve clients even more effectively and finally we will invest in automation and systems modernization over the next several years allowing us to drive greater efficiency winwin monetization remains an important opportunity where we can both delight clients and boost our revenue looking ahead well continue to make investments to enable clients to keep more of their financial life with us including a continued focus on lending capabilities that meets the needs of more clients across both is and as well enhance our wealth and advice offerings including making continued investments in schwab wealth advisory the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 well continue to build on our momentum with personalized investing solutions and well continue to broaden the breadth and depth of product offerings with new offers like alternative investments and we continue to do work to integrate the workplace experience more into schwab allowing our workplace clients to benefit from all we have to offer at schwab within client segmentation well remain focused on meeting the unique needs of our client segments including our higher net worth clients traders and rias part of this is providing differentiated client experiences just as weve done this year with the new retail high net worth and ultrahigh net worth offers that i spoke to earlier this also means enhanced service models specialized capabilities our powerful trading platform and our tailored education our fourth focus area is ease with the size of our asset base we can drive growth by simply delivering easy and exceptional experiences to our existing clients this is where youll see us continue to invest to make schwab the easiest place in the industry to do business and its important to remember something walt highlighted earlier our clients frame of reference for ease is not just other financial services firms its the experiences they have on amazon or uber or doordash and thats the measure of ease we are striving to accomplish we want every experience a client has with us to be an exceptional one that means well continue to make enhancements on all of our channels well continue to digitize client workflows and to make sure our clients have access when and where they want it whether thats on schwabcom or the mobile app or when they call or chat with our service teams or walk into a branch we believe that the combination of these efforts will help power our longterm organic growth guided by our seeing through clients eyes strategy we are wellpositioned to retain our clients and to win new ones fueling our organic nna growth over the longterm ive spoken about schwabs unique strengths in this form in the past we have a top one or two position in the two fastestgrowing segments of financial services our strengths will help us attract assets from our existing clients including our younger client base valuable dedicated relationships strong ria growth and our emphasis on ease well attract new clients through the combination of the strength of our brand our proven retail acquisition model and our continued commitment to serving rias and with the four strategic focus areas i just talked through well be able to meet evolving client needs while making it easier for clients to keep more of their financial lives with us helping us attract nna over the long term schwabs future is bright and before i turn it over to peter id like to spend just a couple more minutes talking about some of the exciting opportunities ahead one of our biggest opportunities is to fully harness the powerful combination of schwab and ameritrade while its still relatively early days when we look at our ameritrade clients we know they are already benefiting from the breadth of schwabs capabilities including both lending and wealth of former ameritrade fcs have helped the client find a solution to their needs by enrolling them in a schwab wealth solution and former ameritrade fcs accounted for about of our record schwab wealth advisory net flows in today former ameritrade client advice penetration is at approximately which is above historical levels the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 schwab clients are benefiting as well we launched the new schwab trading powered by ameritrade experience in october and at yearend more than schwab clients had created new thinkorswim accounts and about of newtofirm retail clients opted to access a thinkorswim account the opportunity ahead for us is tremendous we have about a share of the market and we serve the two fastestgrowing segments i just spoke about our early wins and increasing ameritrade advice penetration as we continue to win here we believe we have a billionplus share of wallet nna opportunity ahead of us and we believe the winwin monetization opportunities ive spoken about represent a billion to billion wealth management and bank lending revenue opportunity to wrap up our through clients eyes strategy continues to guide us into the next chapter were in the final stages of the ameritrade integration and we made meaningful progress across our key strategic focus areas in the last year looking ahead we are wellpositioned to continue our healthy organic growth and the opportunities in front of us remain highly attractive both for schwab and for our clients and with that ill turn it over to peter peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp well thank you very much rick so walt and rick talked about how our no tradeoff positioning continues to resonate with both clients and progress prospects the continued progress were making with the ameritrade acquisition with the final transition group scheduled for may our achievements and priorities around scale and efficiency winwin monetization segmentation and our newer priority ease and the large opportunity in front of us over the coming years in my time today ill briefly review our financial performance provide an update on client cash realignment and share some thoughts on the important point is that in the fourth quarter and really over the last nine months we continued to see notable improvement across the various tactical metrics on which there has been a lot of focus lately including the pace of client cash reallocation activity the level of supplemental borrowing were utilizing and our capital levels inclusive of aoci and what that means is that is likely to be somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint but with steadily improving financial results that bridge from what proved to be a challenging to what we believe is a very promising future ahead and so while environmental factors may not allow progress to follow a strictly linear path we believe were moving ever closer to the point where the noise partially obscuring our longterm growth should dissipate and our relatively straightforward financial formula should begin to reassert itself once again powered by solid organic growth our diversified business model converting that asset growth into strong revenue growth through the cycle continued expense discipline producing growing margins and as our tangible capital levels continue to grow the return of meaningful opportunistic capital return in other words a resumption of the proven model that you are all familiar with and that has delivered for clients and stockholders for over five decades as walt mentioned was an eventful year for many of our clients and certainly a challenging one for our business model and so not surprisingly our financial performance was off 2022s record levels with a little under billion of revenue and of adjusted eps but despite those financial headwinds we still produced an adjusted pretax margin of over our fifth consecutive year doing so which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business model through a wide range of environments the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 now turning our attention to the balance sheet the big story last year of course was the roughly decline in client cash on our balance sheet of which over moved in the first half of the year this is the outcome of clients moving some of their cash into higheryielding alternatives and as walt mentioned that was often with our active support and encouragement and importantly that money is staying at schwab as evidenced by the approximately billion increase in purchase money funds and over billion increase in fixed income and cds our clients hold and we supported some of that activity by utilizing temporary or supplemental borrowing including both fhlb advances and schwab bank cds and at just under billion at the end of the quarter those have fallen by more than billion from the peak level reached in may and finally our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated tier leverage ratio rising to and our adjusted tier leverage ratio inclusive of aoci and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the aoci optout at schwab bank is now nearly meaning we are now meeting what will likely be the new wellcapitalized standard at our banks over four years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date during last quarters update we talked about the slowing pace of client cash realignment over the preceding months and in november our clients actually added to their transactional cash balances and then in december we saw an approximately billion increase in transactional sweep cash now historically december flows benefit from seasonal factors but even so when you compare december to december it is quite clear that this dynamic is receding as an important driver for us you can also see that trend when you look at purchase money fund flows and specifically that minority of those net flows that are funded from client cash on the balance sheet now as we turn our attention to our nearterm financial performance will as always be shaped by external factors that are difficult to predict interest rates equity market performance and client trading activity and then given the much larger sensitivity to client cash allocations given where interest rates are today than they were lets say three years ago that will of course be a significant factor so lets talk about this one and given the importance of this lets spend a bit more time here there are really three main forces that will influence the trend of our clients transactional cash during any remaining client cash realignment from existing clients the contribution of cash we attract from new clients which ill talk about in a moment is the source of the greatest uncertainty moving forward and seasonal dynamics that are generally similar every year but can vary based on environmental conditions well start with the behavior of our existing clients and as weve discussed were clearly in the very late innings of the client cash realignment activity you can see it in the monthly reporting weve shared whether you look at the total balances balances per account or cash as a percent of assets and that high level trend is supported by various dynamics you see when you look under the hood were seeing stabilization of activity among both ria and retail clients we now weve talked about how cash realignment is an event not a process and were seeing a decrease in both the number of those events and the average amount of the cash being realigned now while we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to predict the behavior of our existing clients its a bit harder to do so with new clients over a very short timeframe like a year now that contribution depends on the level of new clients we attract and the size of those accounts and then how much of the net new assets comes in the form of cash and stays there which will be influenced by investor sentiment quantitative tightening by the fed inflation savings rates and so forth the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 and then you throw it at an election year which normally brings an elevated degree of volatility makes these predictions even tougher and what this means is that while we have seen throughout our history that over time cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and assets over a shorter period like a quarter or a year its harder to gauge exactly how much new accounts will contribute and finally the evolution of transactional cash over the course of is likely to be influenced by seasonal patterns which follow a similar trajectory every year but can vary in terms of their magnitude that means were seeing some cash getting invested into the markets in the first quarter and given the large inflows we saw in december the investment activity could be at elevated start this year and then well likely see a reduction in april as clients pay taxes before we cap the year with an anticipated buildup in december so what does all this mean for our financial performance given the various moving pieces we decided to bring back a concept you may recall we last used in which is to share with you a couple of mathematical illustrations around how our financial performance could unfold based on what happens with certain difficultto predict inputs and those are trading activity we looked at flat to levels or plus or minus and where transactional cash finishes the year relative to the levels again flat plus or minus and those illustrations share a couple of common and pretty conventional assumptions most importantly normal market appreciation and rates that follow the dot plots and those illustrations could result in revenue that is plus or minus there are levels or said another way revenue that is to higher than our annualized q4 run rate even with three rate cuts and were planning as weve shared previously to keep adjust the expenses flat yearoveryear and that would result in an adjusted pretax margin of a little under to somewhere in the mid now i know its tempting to pick the midpoint of the illustrations and interpret that as our outlook that is not how these illustrations are intend to be used this is just math using some metrics you can track on an ongoing basis to evolve your own perspectives on our potential performance over time and as we typically do we have included in the appendix a set of sensitivities intended to help you make adjustments as you see fit now looking at the range of possibility it doesnt imply much of any growth in terms of full year adjusted eps but given the consistent pay down in the higher cost supplemental borrowing it suggests strong sequential momentum in revenue and in earnings with a potential exit velocity heading into that is at least better than where we ended and with increasing momentum as we progress through as well lets drill a little deeper into the expense story schwab has been and always will be a growth company a company that continually invest in improving the client experience at the same time were a company that recognizes that one of our biggest competitive advantages as walt mentioned is our industryleading cost structure which is measured as eoca achieving both of those requires careful balance and discipline and in even as were holding the spending flat were still making significant investments that rick talked about that will help sustain our longterm organic growth boost our revenue and increase our efficiency during and beyond our current revenue and earnings are being pressured of course by our utilization of the higher cost funding in the form of cds and fhlb advances those are very much a temporary funding source and as we pay off those we continue to see a path towards a net interest margin in the to range by the end of this year and approaching by the end of even if rates fall roughly basis points from where they are today as the dot plots would indicate with the potential for it to expand further moving forward as we reinvest our securities portfolio at higher market rates than what we currently earn the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 now while we paused our buyback in order to build our capital levels capital return remains a very important part of our financial formula given our very return on capital and negligible credit exposure our capital levels have already reached the socalled wellcapitalized threshold even if aoci is included and wed expect our consolidated adjusted tier leverage ratio to reach the upper range by the end of at which point well be in a position to at least consider resuming opportunistic buybacks both walt and i talked about being somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint but we also talked about the steady improvement we expect to see throughout the year in some ways i hate to use the phrase coiled spring but i think thats exactly what is being set up as we move into as we complete the ameritrade integration creating a true bestofbreed platform and unlocking both revenue and expense synergies we continue to advance our strategic agenda even as we maintain flat expenses transactional cash balances inflect and we begin to see sustained growth and all of that plus continued business momentum creates an opportunity for a return to sequential revenue growth and accelerating momentum toward the end of the year and into and that paves the way for return to our longterm financial formula one that is powered by our position as the premier asset gatherer producing consistent to organic growth through the cycle with industry leading client loyalty and a leadership position in the two fastestgrowing segments within wealth management one that has a proven ability to expand margins through the cycle with the potential for even more dramatic margin expansion in the years ahead back above as revenue benefits from paying off higher cost borrowings and expenses benefits from harvesting the remaining expense synergies and one that can combine that strong organic growth and revenue growth with more meaningful capital return as our capital levels inclusive of aoci march higher and so when you take a step back and look at our potential financial performance your perspective depends on your timeframe in the immediate term we have been dealing with some pressures that have constrained our financial results but those are pressures are temporary not permanent so longterm opportunity the longterm potential remains significant and as an organization that has a longtime horizon that is what fuels our optimism our confidence and our excitement for what lies ahead and with that ill turn it over to jeff to facilitate our qa jeff jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp hi operator can you please remind everyone how they can ask a question and ill turn it over to you the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question in queue is from ken worthington from jpmorgan please go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning and thank you for taking the question i wanted to talk about net new assets so even when excluding the ameritrade attrition core net new assets seemed decently lower than it had been over the last two years despite ultimately what were better market conditions in as we sort of look at it core monthly indiscernible per month and then in the last six months its been ph billion to billion and theres noise there attrition cds but it still ultimately seems like softer engagement over the last six months so the question so first was it and that were unusual in the aftermath of covid or is it really the last six months that might have been unusual do you see a cohort or customer segment where engagement might have weakened in the second half of and ultimately can you give us a little bit more color on how you see the outlook for walter w bettinger ii a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thanks ken i think when you look at nna in very short periods of time you have to really evaluate sentiment more so than what the market did when i spoke at the end of the third quarter last october the sentiment was very negative and although it slipped by the end of the year thats a late change within the year and so when you have negative sentiment historically when we look at longertime horizons youre going to get lower levels of nna and so i think its not what the market does its what the sentiment of the investor is we dont see any reason to believe that net new assets are likely to be constrained over a longer period of time relative to historic levels our promoter scores when we look at that as theyre reported on the retail side remain very very strong on the advisor side we have retained virtually all of the advisors that we wanted to retain post integration so i dont see anything on the horizon that would tell me that longterm youre going to see some form of extended softening in nna but short run you have to look at sentiment and you also have to look at investment options as rates are higher people may bring a bit less money to their investment account as opposed to maybe leaving it at a bank where they might just be buying cds or something of that nature but nothing structurally gives us cause for concern operator thank you next well go to steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning i had a question clarifying question just on the nim glide path peter that you had offered so you had previously talked about that nim exiting you reaffirmed the target here despite the additional cuts in the forward curve i was hoping you could speak to some of the inputs still supporting that the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 nim target with the rebasing and rate expectations and the nim tailwind of to what is the jumping off point that we should be applying that against peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp sure so the biggest driver of the growth in nim from where we are today to is continuing to pay off those supplemental borrowings we dont necessarily need deposits to grow although we obviously expect that will happen between now and we dont need deposits to actually grow to be able to do that remember weve got probably billion or billion per quarter in cash flow coming from the investment portfolio thats cash thats earning was roughly today and we can use that to pay off supplemental borrowings thats costing us lets say on average and so thats a significant nim advantage and indiscernible advantage and revenue advantage that were able to generate every month that we dont that we have even flat deposits so thats really the biggest driver between for the nim growth between now and the end of and frankly between now and the end of as well operator thank you next well go to kyle voigt from kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning another one for peter as we think about a potential fed cutting environment i was wondering if you could comment on how you think about deposit betas on the bank sweep on the way down in other words should we expect betas to mirror what we saw on the way up because i dont think you increased bank sweep rates over the last basis points of hikes or so or given that the current cash balances that remain on your balance sheet are likely the least ratesensitive deposits could there be some leeway to begin to modestly move those bank sweep rates lower even with the first fed cut peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks thanks kyle for the question so i think its reasonable to think that the betas could be a bit higher on the way down than they were on the way up at basis points in bank sweep were paying a rate today that is significantly better than what traditional banks are offering on checking accounts theyre still paying i think in many cases basis point or basis points for accounts that have similar liquidity features or in some cases even inferior liquidity features and so i wouldnt necessarily assume that the deposit betas on the way down will be symmetrical to where they were on the way up necessarily operator thank you next well go to brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions just a couple of questions peter for the past and thinking about nim and the scenarios number one i think you referenced that these scenarios are based on the dot plot but you also referenced the forward curve so maybe could you clarify which rate assumptions underpin the scenarios that you laid out and also how should we think about forecasting the interestearning assets you referenced billion to billion of principal is that the pace that we should be thinking about through much of until that wholesale borrowings is paid down thanks the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks for the question so the mathematical illustrations are based on the dot plots which again saw three cuts over the course of and i think its basis points by the end of of easing in terms of the pace of interestearning assets our priority is to pay off the supplemental borrowings and so as we continue to prioritize that its reasonable to expect that our interestearning assets would decline again doing so you could be in a situation where our interestearning assets are declining but revenue is increasing because again were paying off those supplemental borrowings of that billion to billion of quarterly cash flow from the investment portfolio a portion of that is principal and of course a portion about is interest so i wouldnt assume that the interestearning assets are going down by that necessarily by that level but i do think its reasonable to expect that therell be some decline as long as we have the supplemental borrowings outstanding were endeavoring to pay those off as quickly as possible operator thank you next well go to dan fannon from jefferies please go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning another followup here peter just in the context of some of the seasonality charts you gave and what we saw in the fourth quarter fhlb declined slower in the fourth quarter versus third quarter yet deposit trends got better so as we think about the start of this year and clearly pace is important how do we think about the seasonal benefits or cash trends versus those priorities of paying down the shorterterm funding peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so we saw i think if you look at the we ended the year with our we target sort of in the bank kind of a to overnight liquidity at the banks that position roughly doubled at the end of the year we always like to build up extra liquidity if you look at our prior years we did the same thing to make sure we have a lot of excess liquidity heading into what is again typically the seasonal investment season so we expect to drawdown those liquidity levels and that will help to support the seasonal activity that that were seeing if you look at prior years over the course of the last several years you can kind of gauge or sense for that seasonal activity and i would say this month is progressing kind of consistent with that so without getting to sort of specific numbers in terms of what were seeing month to day i would say its consistent with what weve seen in previous years and consistent with our expectations but again its not let me be really clear that the seasonal activity that we see in january through march and tax season in april this isnt client cash realignment this is just activity that we see every single year as clients build up their cash balances at the end of the year and then deploy those into the markets in the first part of the year and then deploy those to the irs i guess in april operator thank you next well go to alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question just another quick followup on the funding dynamics so i appreciate it may be difficult to predict client behavior with respect to transactional sweep cash on new the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 assets but maybe give us some color on the trends youve seen in transactional cash as a percentage of net new client assets call it over the last maybe six months or so just to help kind of with the starting point because obviously thats a really important dynamic when it comes to rebuilding the cash balances and deposits peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so that i mean thats why we called that out as i would say an area of uncertainty going forward is because we are seeing not surprisingly were seeing clients who are coming in are realigning their cash as existing clients are and so thats happening theres a certain amount of a float if you will that we typically rely on that that is contributed a little bit less over the previous six months as clients are realigning their cash more quickly maybe than traditionally they would have done indiscernible as rates come down one would expect that that activity would be a little bit less immediate or timely or to the same extent and so i think that is one of the uncertainties what happens with the level of new cash that comes in as the fed cuts rates three times four times six times whatever it might be thats why we call that out as an area of uncertainty but we certainly still expect as weve seen throughout history that over time as we add accounts as we add assets again over a long sort of longer arc of history that those transactional cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and the growth in assets just over a short period of time like a quarter or a year its a little bit harder to gauge exactly what the nearterm contribution will be but again over time over three years five years et cetera we expect that our total transactional cash balances will grow as we grow our client base operator thank you and our final jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp i think we have time for one last question operator absolutely our last question comes from devin ryan from jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah thanks so much good morning i guess different topic than some of the other questions but probably for rick since you mentioned it in your remarks so obviously the firm has a strong technology background so id love to just talk a bit more detail about the opportunity you guys see from artificial intelligence investment as we look beyond so maybe looking out the next three to five years what are some of the areas youre most focused on how much efficiency do you think could be derived from kind of current use cases you see how much productivity uplift and just more generally how material ai will be for schwab because it would seem like this fits right into kind of the ethos of the company long term but i know sometimes things take a while to kind of implement so i would just love to hear a little bit more about the strategy there thanks richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 17jan2024 devin thanks for the question on ai i think it will have a meaningful impact in three areas on our employees on our efficiency and on our clients let me start with employees i think ai can be used to make our employees even more effective with our clients to provide them with the ability to have an answer that is really strong and in particular for our newer employees that are coming up to speed the ability for ai to make them as efficient or as effective as a more experienced employee i think will be powerful both for the employee and for our clients that are receiving the thought from that person so i think theres a lot of benefits in helping make our employees more effective with clients theres clearly an efficiency opportunity in ai and in here with thousands of phone reps that we hire each year at some point wed likely will have the opportunity to hire less in a particular year because weve made our reps both on the phone on chat in our branches even more effective and efficient because were powering them with information and putting it out there at their fingertips and then i think theres lot of client benefits that will come from ai we have what i believe is the worlds best trading platform in thinkorswim and a lot of clients invest years and years into building out their platform into building out their alerts and what types of signals theyre looking at to drive what they may want to buy and i think the opportunity for our clients to leverage an aidriven research platform will provide them with even greater insights into how they trade into what positions they may want to put on into what risks they may need to be aware of and so i think ai will directly impact clients in the future so when i think about both making our employees as effective as possible becoming as efficient as possible and driving great client outcomes i think ai will play an important role in all three peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp okay well thank you thank you rick and let me just close you know walt and i both said could be a bit of a transitional year albeit with steady progression in our financial results throughout the year i think its really important to put that concept in an appropriate context first is that were talking about top line growth versus where we finished and second and more importantly as we emerge from this challenging period were not transitioning or changing our strategy our focus on clients the discipline with which we run the business nor should you expect to see us lowering our organic growth aspirations or results or changing the fundamentals of our financial formula those have all worked quite well and were confident will continue to serve our clients and our stockholders well in the years ahead we thank you very much and
