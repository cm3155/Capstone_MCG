corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks to everyone for joining us today i hope you and your families remain safe and healthy first quarter was a great start to we had strong balance sheet growth supported by stable diverse funding sources continued fee income momentum and solid asset quality metrics all core elements of our investment thesis delivered on a consistent basis consumer sentiment is slowly returning to more normalized levels and our customers remain cautiously optimistic modified loan balances are now close to zero and weve seen debit and credit card spend returning to prepandemic levels operationally its status quo as most of our nonbranch associates remain remote majority of our branches reopened with regular hours earlier this month and traffic continues to be normal as expected turning to our first quarter results net income was million or per share and pretax preprovision income on an fte basis was million or per share you may have noticed our quarterly deck has been updated with a refreshed look and additional information we listened to the feedback from many of you and have a concise quarterly financial section followed by more details on our various businesses showing metrics and drivers in each and a longerterm view of metrics supporting our investment thesis is included for those who may not know our story as well slide shows the primary drivers behind our results and ill provide some highlevel comments then turn it over to ram for more detail net interest income was essentially flat from the fourth quarter as the positive impact from strong balance sheet growth was mitigated by lower loan fees and ppp income as well as the day count in the quarter on a yearoveryear basis net interest income increased despite the challenging interest rate environment our track record of relative outperformance in asset growth and the opportunities we see to continue bode well for our ability to grow net interest income over time as we gain market share in many of our unpenetrated markets and verticals fee income for the quarter was impacted largely by swings in investment security gains and losses in the first quarter the valuation of our position in tattooed chef drove a million marktomarket unrealized loss compared to the million fourth quarter gain excluding market fluctuations there were some bright spots as we continue to focus on growth in fee income trust and securities processing income increased from the fourth quarter and nearly on a yearoveryear basis the businesses that drive that line have experienced solid growth benefiting from both market appreciation and new sales activity in fund services assets under administration now stand at billion compared to billion a year ago specialty corporate trust launched internationally during the quarter opening an office in dublin which is a top economic center for structured finance were excited about the potential for growth this adds to our aviation trust business as well as opportunities to expand our offerings in other business lines we are also eagerly anticipating the potential for increased spending related to the proposed infrastructure bill which could be a great opportunity for both our underwriting and corporate trust fee business our investor solutions team continues to focus on growth in fintech clients with opportunities to provide fdic sweep and faster custody services among others we added four fintech relationships in and have an active pipeline umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 and were seeing some traction from recent investments in our private wealth space where weve added reporting and trading capabilities for a variety of investment types during the quarter we brought on a new cio for our family office business and look forward to developments there on the digital front weve seen increasing use of our online account opening and mobile offering of nonmortgage loan applications and of new retail deposit accounts were initiated online in the first quarter general engagement with online banking is up nearly from first quarter last year which shows that people are using our digital tools to track monitor and transact their accounts after several years of investing in customerfacing application our digital capabilities are competitive and we are now focusing on growth and penetration and while weve had new delivery channels as industry dynamics have shifted we havent forgotten the importance of connecting with our customers moving to the balance sheet we once again posted strong loan growth with an linked quarter annualized increase in average balances excluding ppp slide is a snapshot of our diverse loan portfolio followed by quarterly loan activity in cre were seeing traction in our expansion markets growth in ci came from a variety of industries this quarter including materials and commodities technology and commercial services additionally our success in building our mortgage capabilities has continued as evidenced by the nearly increase in average residential mortgage loans from the fourth quarter of which are included in the consumer real estate line on the balance sheet new originations for the quarter were million outside of ppp balance changes with payoffs and paydowns of of loans looking into the second quarter we see a robust pipeline in both ci and cre despite some uncertainty related to the covid trends and the status of reopening in various markets given what we know today its reasonable to expect our strong momentum and market opportunity should continue our core deposit growth continued driven by our institutional business along with the seasonal buildup of public funds and the impact of the recent stimulus payments average balances increased on a linkedquarter basis and compared to the first quarter of dda growth helped drive the cost of total deposits to just basis points leading to a total funding cost of basis points our average loantodeposit ratio while typically much lower than our peers was for the quarter our differentiated customer base which drives diverse sources of funding and revenue comes with larger deposit balances ram will provide more detail about how were managing our liquidity position in this environment on slide weve updated our exposure to sensitive industries as we moved further through the pandemic weve adjusted this list to reflect both the characteristics of our portfolio and the evolving outlook for various categories changes this quarter include the removal of oil and gas based on our borrower performance and stabilizing oil prices and student housing cre where industry occupancy levels are improving loans in the three remaining categories totaled billion or of loans excluding ppp after our typical analysis of mitigating factors including strong sponsors and guarantors we feel that approximately million or of loans could possibly carry more risk in a prolonged crisis as always we remain in close contact with these borrowers umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 at the bottom of the page youll see that our modified loan balances have continued to decline ending the quarter at just million under ph onehalf of of loans on the credit front net chargeoffs averaged just basis points of loans while levels of nonperforming assets improved from the end of the prior period as we noted last quarter improving macroeconomic conditions and the continued quality of our loan portfolio drove the million negative provision as the economic backdrop continues to normalize and business conditions improve additional releases may be warranted total allowance for credit losses on loans stand at million with an allowance to loan coverage of excluding ppp loans that coverage is to wrap up im pleased with our first quarter performance and im excited about the opportunity we see in the remainder of and beyond our corporate citizenship report has just been published and is available on our website it highlights our continued efforts and actions related to the environmental social and corporate governance issues we continually adapt to find the right balance of implementing sustainable business practices building diverse teams meeting obligations and using our resources to do good this balance has helped guide our response to the covid19 crisis now ill turn it over to ram for a few comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner net interest income of million was comparable to the prior quarter and included approximately million in loan income from ppp balances on a linkedquarter basis nii levels were flat as the benefits from earning asset growth were mitigated by the impact of two fewer days as well as lower loan fees loan yields were compared to in the fourth quarter and total earning asset yields decreased basis points to due largely to the billion of increased liquidity our fed account reverse repo and cash balances averaged billion in the first quarter comprising of average earning assets and yield of basis points compared to billion or of earning assets and basis points in the fourth quarter the excess liquidity buildup reflects seasonal inflows from our public funds and other businesses as well as the benefits from federal stimulus programs the basis points decline in net interest margin on a linkedquarter basis was driven largely by excess liquidity if those balances had remained consistent with prior quarter our reported net interest margin would have been basis points higher additionally if the liquidity levels were consistent with historical averages from prepandemic levels our margin would be approximately basis points higher as mariner mentioned our business model makes our experience unique the seasonality of funding from our municipal clients and large institutional volumes including in our aviation trust business add variability to our liquidity positions besides funding loan growth opportunities we continue to deploy a portion of this liquidity as well as cash flows from our securities portfolio to increase our afs portfolio footings as evidenced by the billion increase in these balances from last year during the quarter alone we purchased billion of securities that yielded given the excess money supply in the system our nearterm focus will remain on deploying these funds prudently and patiently with a focus to increase net interest income umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 looking ahead the margin trajectory will largely depend on the levels of liquidity pace and timing of ppp forgiveness and reinvestment rates on cash flows in the securities portfolio overall we would expect some modest margin pressure in the second quarter noninterest income was million for the first quarter and contained a million pretax loss on the valuation of our ttcf investment which was partially offset by marktomarket gains on equity and other holdings and million in gain from the previously noted sale of prairie capital management at the end of march additionally coli income decreased million with its typical offset in reduced compensation expense the details of our various fee income lines are shown on slide and mariner commented on some of the growth opportunities we have seen in several of those businesses on the expense side we saw a reduction of million from the elevated levels we discussed in the fourth quarter legal and consulting expenses moderated from the prior quarter and incentive compensation declined partially offset by the seasonal increase in fica insurance and 401k expense the tax rate was for the quarter for the full year we anticipate it will be approximately between to we continue to maintain strong capital ratios with our total riskbased capital at cet1 ratio at and leverage ratio at our tangible book value per share increased during the last months to at march that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey good morning ph eb ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 i guess just the first question ram sticking with net interest income one to clarify your guidance for modest pressure in is im assuming for the gaap margin and secondarily just talk to us in terms of how youre thinking about cash deployment do you see some of the deposit liquidity leaving the bank and if not like do you expect to operate with this elevated liquidity levels in the nearterm just give us your thought process around managing liquidity versus investing in the ph bond book mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah sure good morning ebrahim its mariner ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ill start with some high level sort of background information and ram can talk about our deployment strategies and the things were doing i think the first thing id say is the whole industry obviously is dealing with excess liquidity between stimulus and ppp were all sitting on a lot of liquidity for umb in addition to that we have a pretty decent sized institutional book of business which also is carrying excess liquidity at this time so the thing about well we monitor this not only is it sticking around but its growing so on a yearoveryear basis were up in deposits and thats really hard ph hit no matter what you do to keep up with that and so thats kind of the backdrop and i would say we yes oftentimes ph people say what are you doing about that liquidity as if were not doing something about it but you have to also recognize yeah we have industry leading loan growth so i feel were doing a pretty good job of deploying it in general and its a tough thing to keep up with we are doing several things and ill ask ram here to tell you what were doing about it on a goforward and perspective basis ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah sure ebrahim ph as we said in the prepared comments right so we have been pretty active in deploying this liquidity you can see it in our balance sheet our afs portfolio is up about billion from a year ago and just in the fourth or the first quarter alone we bought about billion of securities both mortgage backed and some munis as well so we are being very active in deploying this and were also looking at other options given some of this liquidity is going to be here to stay with us until another six to eight quarters so we are overbuying bonds in excess of what our cash flows from our securities portfolio is doing and then at the margin true to what our umb culture is well also do investment options like well buy small pools of mortgage loans im not talking anything big million million were doing triparty reverse repos and then when available weve done million to million in a diversified pool of subdebt of other banks so we continuously evaluate all the options in front of us so that we can deploy this liquidity so that a lot of this liquidity ph isnt earning basis points at the fed account but yeah we are really active and looking at different options to deploy this liquidity umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 and then the first part of your question just to clarify yes on a gaap margin basis some modest pressure in the second quarter but to round out this conversation at the end of the day were really confident between our loan growth and what were doing on the securities portfolio with the deployment that net interest income should be a differentiated story and thats our investment thesis as weve highlighted in our investor deck mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i said that last quarter i mean its nii right now in this interest rate environment we really feel like it should focus on our ability to grow earnings through nii so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood so i guess the message is the million in exppp nii that should be headed higher from here and ram do you have the details on the remaining ppp fees and just any sense of the breakdown of round versus how the forgiveness proceeds ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp so we have another million of unrecognized revenues from ppp1 and ppp2 left again the calendar of when we get to recognize this will depend on the forgiveness process obviously we have about million left on our ppp1 so thats probably coming through in calendar year at this point its too early to say about this ppp2 we did originate about million as part of the ppp2 program that youll see on our balance sheet ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just moving mariner so obviously i mean i think revenue growth aboveaverage loan growth has been sort of a differentiating aspect for umb just looking at the loan production levels i guess in one of your slides that declined yearoveryear and was weakest in the last five quarters anything going on there does that speak to just borrowers being in a waitandwatch mode and knowing what you know now do you expect core loan growth be in that highsingle digits lowdouble digits range for the year mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp im not trying to so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc slide mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp slide youve seen ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc it says gross loan production is down yearoveryear umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think thats just timing thats mostly timing we continue to see growth across the board that theres nothing to that story really the one headwind we have on our ci business is just lower utilization and thats a significant opportunity as we roll forward as the economy opens up and things normalize we should weve got about percentage points off our regular utilization rate and i know everybody is talking about that but thats ph late in earnings power there in growth but were making up for that really across the board i would say both geographically and vertically and that slide is just more of a timing thing on a yearoveryear basis ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so we ph will ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc but mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp second quarter as i mentioned in my comments looks strong ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then just one last one if i may in terms of capital deployment talk to us i mean you talked about some fintech partnerships youve previously talked about bank ma give us a sense of where your mind is at in terms of ability to deploy capital inorganically mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah were i dont really have anything new to say than what ive been saying for some time there where we have an active ma process we are actually having conversations with other banks and were just looking for the right deal and were not going to do were not going to go do something just to do it so were looking for the right deal and its an active process and on the nonbank side as weve said before were always in the market looking for bolton opportunities for our corporate trust business our public finance business our fund services business which by the way year overyear we were up billion in assets under administration in our fund services business so across the board our institutional businesses are very very strong and we are always looking for those bolton opportunities to continue to consolidate umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp ebrahim this is jim rine on the fintech side those will continue to be partnerships where well offer our banking as a service products and open up our balance sheet and services for those companies where well do the bank in a box type model offer fdic sweep or account services in debit cards et cetera so that will provide the additional fee income and partnerships with those folks versus looking to acquire unless the opportunity is right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and do break down the contribution from these partnerships or the kind of fintech fees or deposits mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we do not make that public separately from the rolloff ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it all right thanks for taking my questions operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared maybe first on expenses great quarter for expense run rate and if i recall correctly i think theres a little bit over million kind of seasonal payroll expense in the quarter as we look ahead does all of that fall through to the bottom line in the second quarter as some of that rolls off or are there going to be investments made that is going to offset some of that reduction mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ram why dont you take that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah like we said last quarter timur right our expense run rate is about million million any particular quarter it goes up and down but you are right there are some seasonal increases that are typical to the first quarter like fica so that can decrease by million to million as you go into the second quarter and then a large part of our expense base as ive said before is also variable rate in nature like bonus and commission so when bond trading or other business activity is really strong that can also skew our expense from one quarter to another quarter one thing that i would say in terms of looking ahead right we announced the sale of prairie capital management and annually thats about million of expenses so youll see that recede starting the second quarter so as you think about expenses going forward i would model it that way as well umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color and then maybe if i could just followup on ebrahims question on loan growth its been a couple of quarters now where the conversation has been about growing balances in underrepresented markets im just wondering a how much more runway is there and then b in the backend of the year if some of the more traditional pipelines come back online should we expect to see growth accelerate from here or is this kind of a good level to see loan growth going forward for a longer period of time mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah so what id say about that is that its much longer than a couple quarters weve got kind of a decade of close to doubledigit loan growth behind us and we dont really expect anything different in the future than what weve seen in the past so the commentary about that penetration is theres a pretty big longterm runway across our footprint as you think about penetration so almost every market were in outside of kansas city is larger by population and business activity than kansas city and we have very low market share in almost all of them so through just pure execution and having the right teams on the ground weve got a really long runway really across the board both geographically and vertically james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp and this is jim rine and what that means is its not dependent on the economy generally were taking market share which is someone elses client so when we are obtaining market share were taking business thats already there that is not necessarily dependent upon the current economic activity so as we grow our market share in those particular markets it doesnt have anything to do with the economy it has to do with our sales efforts timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you for the question mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks timur operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ram maybe ill start with you the million just for modeling purposes the million of expenses from prairie whats the can you provide the revenue run rate that we need to remove as well ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah if you look at the last couple of years its averaged about million to million mostly in fees all of it is fees christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc million to million okay ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp the net contribution is anywhere from million to million christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes got it okay and then just kind of putting the pieces together with the constructive outlook on revenue and the good expense quarter i mean you had positive operating leverage last year is that kind of base case for this year given where we are economically mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think so i mean generally its hard to tell there are a lot of moving parts but we i guess what id say is we do feel strongly that weve got our expenses under control and we do feel pretty strong about our revenue profile so absent any headwinds or challenges to come our way that we do feel like sort of some level of operating leverage is reasonable to expect ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i would agree with that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then on credit weve seen a lot of banks just move their reserve down because of the improvement in the economy i think youve alluded to that further releases could be on the horizon how do i think about ram the trough i guess where you get to and when relative to day one of last year with cecl umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so this is mariner were very careful about this and cautious about it because we think that the reserves are there for a reason and our business were in the risk business so were monitoring it closely and obviously in the methodology youve got qualitative and quantitative the quantitative stuff is going to be what it is driven by the performance of our loan portfolio and the growth of our loan portfolio and the moodys indications around economic activity and unemployment so that piece will be what itll be and then we will overlay some qualitative things based on other uncertainties and such to make sure that the reserves are there to protect us and protect our shareholders so we on the track on the trajectory that were on right now it is very reasonable to expect that we would do another release in the second quarter what that looks like how big it is were not prepared to give you any real guidance on that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great and then lastly if i could just i just want to make sure i saw the announcement on the buyback which i know you kind of authorize every year but im putting the pieces together and what you said last quarter mariner i mean thats still kind of bottom of the rung in terms of priorities with capital today buybacks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp absolutely our number one focus is to grow shareholder value and through investing in growth thats the number one priority christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks chris operator operator instructions the next question comes from nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 the growth on the institutional fee income side has been pretty impressive over the last few quarters just trying to get a sense of kind of that growth rate on the asset servicing and corporate trust side of things is sustainable kind of near the rates that weve seen recently or if you guys are expecting somewhat of an acceleration just based on some of the pieces that have been put in place recently mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ill take that start with it and then jim can jump in but what i would say about ph fixed fund services with all the liquidity thats in the system right now and what has happened with interest rates the pursuit of return has been pretty accelerated it has driven a lot of activity in the alternatives and privates over the last ph few years i dont see that slowing down and our fund servicing business is set up we are one of the largest and most successful players in the private and alternative space and so what youve seen is us benefit from that activity of liquidity and the move from public investing to private investing we dont see that slowing down we expect to continue to be a major recipient of that shift in the way money is being invested along with that you have the democratization of private investing which has gone much further downstream into the spectrum of who can invest in private so all that bodes really well in the fund space for the privates and alternatives so thats what i say is the backdrop for our fund services business pipeline is very strong technology platform is great were efficient weve got a top flight team weve been able to pick up people from all our competitors and because of all the consolidation in that business it sort of put a lot of our competitors on the sidelines so were very excited about whats happening with fund services corporate trust business we continue to consolidate there and that business is poised really well for win win and if im going to say win because i believe thats likely to happen the infrastructure build comes through well be poised on a national basis both through corporate trusts and our public finance business to well underwrite settle and do all the indiscernible trust fee services really across the country we have offices in new york now were doing business in florida new york new jersey la large large projects hundreds and hundreds of millions dollar type projects which is a big shift from the kind of size deals we were doing prior to opening offices on the coast so were kind of clipping on the heels of number one and number two as the third largest trustee and paying agent in the country were looking for consolidation opportunities there our specialty business in the aviation space were very excited about particularly as the economy is starting to open up again that means and the boeing issue is resolving themselves i mean planes are going to be getting bought and sold across the globe our irish office in dublin allows us to do business now in more countries than we were able to before ireland is sort of the structured finance capital world and so that allows us to really open the doors for that business globally so thats the corporate trust and our bankruptcy trustee business is doing very very well there too i think we just had our first million quarter in that business in the first quarter so very very excited about that and then our jim touched on our investor solutions business which was a relatively mature business relying on the wirehouses and brokerage firms and now were seeing it grow again by providing the same services to the fintech and you can see in our deck there the four latest fintech companies that have signed up to do business with us and then our wealth business well so you asked about institutional so ill pause there we talked about that umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp i would say the only thing to add on the institutional business is that as the rates have gone down weve seen the fees erode and then as rates go back up that business will continue to be additive as those come back so weve been growing the traditional fee side and then as rates go back up well see fees so mariner hit all the highlights on that i dont have anything else to add other than you can see additional youll look to see additional growth as rates improve mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i always steal jims thunder james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp im used to it nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats great color appreciate it and all the other details in the updated slide deck as well perhaps just changing gears and just going back to the ma discussion just curious with the stocks still near alltime highs and obviously having a strong currency to affect transactions going forward if youre feeling more or less optimistic on the acquisition front on a whole bank perspective looking forward over the course of here mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp im not sure i you might ask that james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp do we feel optimistic ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp ph optimistic on ma front mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp oh yeah i mean nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2021 well certainly i would say if youre talking about just the industry backdrop deals are getting done so pricing seems to be getting some consistency and there seems to be some foundation being built for deals to get done so wed like to think so we hope so but again we dont do ph ticker tape deals were not going to dig deep into something that has some hair on it just to get something done were going to our guidelines keep within the rails of doing good quality high quality deals and we just have to build relationships see what happens nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color thank you guys ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator as we have no further questions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah the only thing i would add this is mariner we didnt really get to talk about wealth management but were very excited about whats going on with the wealth management business we had a very nice quarter we talked mostly about institutional on the fee side but our wealth business had a very strong first quarter with new business and i did mention in our prepared comments that weve launched our family office business we think we have a very unique offering weve hired an excellent cio for that business comes to us from the private side private investing side for northern trust ran the institutional segment for northern and so were very excited about our wealth offering we have the right as an institution has been around a really really long time trusted partner with institutional capital and institutional backing were very excited about how that couples with our commercial business and the prospects for that going forward so thats the only thing i would add and other than that we appreciate everybodys time kay gregory senior vice president directorinvestor relations umb financial corp thank you
