power and potential of this company which today operates a billion plus bank and an billion plus asset management firm all three of our businesses have been built on our core capabilities and distribution strength to drive strong demand for our clientfocused products and services which are in turn delivering continued and meaningful organic growth we again delivered record net interest income and total revenue during the quarter as well as alltime high pre tax income assets under management loans and deposits the performance enabled us to grow first quarter net income by from the linked quarter and over the same period last year these results were achieved thanks to the trust and confidence of our clients which they place in us and the unrelenting efforts of our talented investment management private banking and commercial banking teams chartwell built on last years strong performance to deliver a breakout quarter for our asset manager clearly the markets provided a tailwind which contributed to chartwells strategies performing very well against benchmarks at the same time chartwell is also differentiated by what we believe is a bestinclass business development and distribution capability in the first quarter of alone this business had more than billion of net inflows led by chartwells short duration highyield product and its highgrade fixedincome product to continue its momentum chartwell started the second quarter with more than million in unfunded institutional commitments in its pipeline together business development and investment performance led to assets under management growth of over the last year to billion on march an alltime high first quarter investment management fees of million were up nearly for the same period last year while chartwells run rate revenue as of march was nearly million an increase of from one year prior at the same time chartwells first quarter segment net income was up from the same period last year and we expect to continue improving asset managements contributions to consolidated earnings as we scale this business with the talent and infrastructure we have in place today before we turn to our other businesses i would like chartwells ceo tim riddle to share a few of his thoughts with you given the standout performance our asset manager had in the first quarter tim tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 timothy joseph riddle managing partner chief executive officer chartwell investment partners llc thank you jim chartwells first quarter performance and our optimism about our ability to continue growing revenues and our contributions to tristate capitals earnings are based on the strengths of our investment performance client relationships and distribution capabilities the majority of our million in aum growth during the quarter or of it resulted from positive net flows from existing accounts and from new business so while aum benefited from the markets tailwind in q1 our ability to generate new business and net flows from existing client relationships were the primary drivers of aum growth we dont believe many active managers will be able to make that claim we also made strategic decisions to enhance chartwells operating leverage and segment profitability these efforts began well before the onset of the pandemic and continued throughout as a reminder by the end of we had taken active measures which reduced our annual expense run rate by more than million for the full year chartwells expenses were down a full million yearoveryear the efforts weve made todate have been very successful and we believe positioned us well to deliver profitable growth at an even greater rate moving forward in fact with the team and infrastructure in place today we believe we can grow chartwells aum and revenue by another or so now that confidence is supported by the success of our unparalleled distribution team and by tristate capitals continued commitment to investing in distribution were also continuously developing new products and new avenues to deliver those products to our clients and to prospective clients as one example within the past year we launched collective investment trusts and collective trust funds cits and ctfs resonate with a broader base of prospective clients particularly in the area of outsourced chief investment officer programs or ocio which have become increasingly popular in the institutional market and in fact cits and ctfs have had a meaningful impact on our aum growth particularly over the last six months accounting for approximately million in inflows chartwell is hitting its stride with unique product offerings credible performance exceptional talent and an enviable distribution capability we are focused on scaling our business and enhancing profitability and earnings with that id like to turn it back to jim james f getz chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc thank you tim turning to tristate capital bank total loans grew by over last year to billion on march growth continues to be led by our highly differentiated private banking business we are the nations leading provider of marketable securities backed loans distributed through independent financial advisors trust companies family offices and regional securities firms and we now have financial intermediaries in our referral network private banking loans reached a record of billion at quarter end and now make up of total loans and first quarter private banking loan application volume hit a new record level in up some from the same period last year commercial loans are up nearly yearoveryear as our endmarket commercial real estate lending more than offset pay downs on revolving credit lines and our commercial and industrial portfolio during the first quarter tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 as a reminder we are coming off record ci growth in the fourth quarter of million so over the last six months weve increased commercial and industrial lending by million or our commercial real estate and ci portfolios remained well diversified with strong pipelines new cre and ci originations in the first quarter continue to be primarily with our longstanding relationships this commercial loan growth is truly organic highquality middlemarket growth as we do not offer ppp or any small business products for example with ci our single largest borrower category remains financial services and insurance representing some of commercial and industrial loans this includes our investment fund finance offering including call lines of credit and net asset values of credit and we see excellent ci growth opportunities in this industry vertical alone there are some periods like the first quarter where there may be timing differences in pay downs of lines based on capital calls made in prior quarters also of note many of our financial services company borrowers are members of tristate capitals intermediary network offering our private banking loans to their high net worth clients our equipment finance offering in our ci business also continues to have strong opportunities in the improving economy that we are experiencing considering what the rest of the industry has been reporting for the first quarter so far we think our commercial loan growth todate and our expectations will continue to stand out overall for full year we continue to believe our organic total loan growth goal of to remains very attainable based on the performance achieved in the first quarter and the strong pipelines we have in place today our credit quality continues to be a differentiator among our peers in the industry benefiting from the large proportion of private banking loans as well as the quality and the depth of our commercial lending relationships and our strong fundamental underwriting we did increase npas by million in the first quarter though nonperformers represented just basis points of total assets on march the increase primarily related to two loans to borrowers managing unique situations related to challenges in commercial real estate markets we believe we are adequately reserved notably we have only four nonperformers among thousands of loans in our billion portfolio with private banking representing some of loans the quality of our middlemarket borrowers and our credit talent and underwriting processes we continue to expect to experience low annual credit costs and superior asset quality metrics relative to peers loan growth was fully funded by the continued expansion of our liquidity and treasury management offerings record deposits more than billion at quarterend reflect growth over the last months treasury management deposits which remain an ongoing and strategic focus grew by from one year prior weve steadily managed deposit costs which were down by basis points from the fourth quarter and played a key role in net interest margin expanding by some basis points even more important in our view is our success in consistently growing net interest income dollars across a variety of rate environments since launching the company back in first quarter nii grew to a record million up nearly over the same period last year this marks tristate capitals 21st consecutive quarter of annual net interest income growth continuing to increase nii dollars through highquality volume and margin expansion and responsible growth remains one of our goals for full year tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 nii and noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses combined to generate record quarterly total revenue in the first three months of revenue grew to a record million increasing over the same period last year and for the linked quarter based on the pipelines we mentioned earlier and other expectations our full year revenue growth goal of to remains unchanged first quarter operating expenses grew by only from the same period last year as we continue to invest in our growth companies clients people infrastructure and technology our previously disclosed operating expense growth target remains to for the full year weve built this company to thrive in all seasons with the three businesses supporting one another so that we consistently accomplish top and bottomline growth at superior rates over the longterm while continuously improving operating leverage and increasing earnings for our shareholders thats exactly what we achieved in the first quarter of providing a solid foundation for what we believe will be a consequential year i have with me this morning david demas our cfo tim riddle our ceo at chartwell and brian fetterolf the ceo of tristate capital bank to assist with the call operator would you kindly open the lines question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen at this time well begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today comes from matt oiney from stephens please go ahead with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey great thanks good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc good morning matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc i want to start on the net interest margin and appreciate your expectations from here i think you mentioned last call that you have to be at that margin by the end of the year and it looks like we made some good progress here in the first quarter at the holding company would love to hear any updated thoughts around that david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc matt good morning its david as you saw we were able to deliver on some of the improvement that we talked about with this group last fall and then again in january in terms of margin expansion and we see that continuing to occur in the current rate environment the expansion is primarily driven by our deposit cost reduction and weve made great progress there we were at basis points on deposit cost on a spot basis at yearend that dropped to basis points again on a spot basis at the end of the first quarter we believe well continue to see improvement in deposit costs and wind the year somewhere in the low on a spot basis tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 as you saw nim continued to expand from at yearend to at the end of the first quarter and with deposit costs coming down and with our the floors that weve got in place and what we believe is a benign interest rate environment youll see continued improvement from here and nim will be in the mid to high by yearend at the holding company and a little bit higher than that at the bank matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay perfect thats helpful david and then im also curious at this point how youre managing the balance sheet around liquidity and securities i think on an average basis we saw liquidity move down securities move up would love to understand kind of how youre thinking about that as you move through the year brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc well i think just on real quick this is brian i think were doing a really good job of highlighting the structural really the structural alignment of the funding mechanism and then the asset deployment aspects of the company so last year obviously you have seen a lot happen within the within the funding base and not only responding to what we thought we wanted in liquidity but also responding to our best clients and making sure that we had room and capacity for them and so weve been able to through a lot of communication sales management and prioritization make sure that were really aligning our sort of what we would call it agile funding mechanism with our ability to do that so that predictability i think allows us to make some better use or more efficient use of the balance sheet so david if you want to david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yes so weve matt been focused on bringing cash balances down and deploying the liquidity we had and built last year into longerterm higherreturning assets right so weve built a fair amount of liquidity in the investment portfolio which is high grade aa agency us government securities that are fully pledgeable at the fed and creates a lot of liquidity for us and so weve moved it from cash to other parts of the balance sheet but well continue to focus on the liquidity of the overall balance sheet as we move through the year matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay ill step back in the queue thank you operator our next question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everybody james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc good morning dan tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning jim maybe we talk about deposit growth just quickly very strong in the quarter you touched on in the release the drivers there with the liquidity management business but maybe you can give a little more detail there about whats driving that strong deposit growth and then expectations going forward obviously including the environment with as you just touched on excess liquidity and everything else thanks brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yes yes so thanks so yeah we are i think pretty pleased with the first quarter and if you look at fourth quarter last year and first quarter of this year if you put them together our sixmonth time period we think are pretty representative of what we want to be doing and sort of yeah as we approach this more stable environment but and that i would guess we would classify that as meaningful growth meaningful clients and meaningful business so pretty diversified across the platform actually in those two quarters treasury management was so our service based offerings that drive liquidity balances were a very significant driver of the deposit growth within the first quarter from a balanced perspective and some new relationships which are were pretty excited about and that our national sales business and the family office business both contributing in smaller account sizes but with more names so were trying to really grow our relationships at this time and then sort of build for the future if you will and taking advantage of that but if you look our overall expectations will be our servicebased offerings will be somewhere in the range of to of our deposit growth this year so we did see probably a little bit more on the servicebased originations in the first quarter but if you look at fourth quarter first quarter i think thats a pretty good balance there to on the tm and the servicebased side james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc dan this is jim what youre asking really falls in line with the whole nature of this company from time of inception weve wanted to be consistently reducing the risk profile so at this point as you heard earlier were close to about at of our loans being loans secured by marketable securities they are actually priced every single day and valued so we have a good understanding of what the nature of the collateral is in of that portfolio but more importantly this situation where weve been able to garnish deposits weve taken advantage of to build up the investment portfolio which continues to lower the risk profile if you look back a couple of quarters youll see we took a very meaningful gain in that portfolio of some million and took it out of corporates and put it into agencies and thats what weve been consistently doing and as david pointed out we have an average rating of aa but we also have a short duration on that of years so were really been able to create an appropriate environment for the type of circumstances that we find ourselves in daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific thats great color thanks and then maybe switching over to chartwell so youve had some nice expansion of ebitda margins over the last few quarters you had just mentioned the aum and revenue growth maybe do you think you can continue to see ebitda margins expand in that business and then if you can touch on the timing of the growth expectations within that business thanks tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 timothy joseph riddle a managing partner chief executive officer chartwell investment partners llc sure this is tim in terms of the ebitda margin we would expect that to expand from here weve obviously put a great deal of time and effort in on again controlling the expenses across the board within chartwell and again with our success and continued success in again new business and inflows from existing accounts that naturally will expand that ebitda margin as time goes by in terms of the growing of the aum and the revenues by from here again that we could accomplish that task if in fact the market cooperates and we continue to expand again new product offerings and as i had indicated also opening up new areas where we can distribute those products but that could happen over the course of the next say three to perhaps five years daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks for taking my question operator and our next question comes from russell gunther from da davidson please go ahead with your question russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc good morning russell brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc good morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co let me bigger picture question to start you could just give us an update on sort of where the financial intermediary network stands today and just curious how thats trended over the past year trying to get a sense for you know has the pandemic slowed the growth rate of onboarding new relationships and as the economy reopens and people travel again does that provide a bigger runway to bring more folks on board just appreciate some general thoughts there brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yes yes thanks russell i think overall yeah were continuing to increase that number to the mid ph million range and certainly were very pleased with that type of growth its one of our actually larger growth quarters our applications are did hit a record number were up yearoveryear same quarter and so we are seeing i would say continued success from our distribution platform and as well as just increased tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 awareness and demand and acceptance around what were doing here so its probably unprecedented in terms of our the opportunity that we have and i guess accordingly were really focusing on our meaningful business making sure that were there for our most meaningful clients and making sure that sort of our yeah the additions to the platform or relationships that we know we can serve really well at a premier level but overall to your point were seeing i would say unprecedented opportunity within the channel russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i appreciate it brian thank you for the update and then switching gears a little bit you guys gave some good color on the ci dynamics this quarter just looking for a general update on the equipment finance vertical expectations for growth there going forward thank you brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc yeah yeah sure so i mean i think were very happy with again both the private bank production in the first quarter again when you put fourth quarter and first quarter together record production and again same thing on our commercial side right so overall i guess our distribution capabilities our internal ability to meet client expectations and be there for our clients i would say again that is in a historic high level right now on the commercial side as we pointed out i think in the release if you look at the fourth quarter first quarter were pretty happy with millionplus growth on just again were talking the ci side so were happy with that we did increase our equipment finance and the fund finance verticals of centers of excellence to make sure that we were had opportunities with good clients sort of in all environments and those are more agile products that did well last year from a growth perspective and in the first quarter period a bit of normalization around that fourth quarter into the first quarter but as we look forward were very positive on growth of both of those businesses and i think as we get into the recovery economy were very excited about our prospects within traditional ci so weve again focused a bit on that fund finance equipment finance space in the last months to months and as we move forward from here we know that those are working really well and were really excited what we think we can do in traditional ci and again this is the time when we really stand out to people which is well have to be more thoughtful when youre originating new ci relationships thats what were the best at thats what our people are the best at so were excited about how were going to differentiate ourselves sort of over the next months to months and again we think that as the market opens a little bit as you were talking about just our ability to meet with people a little bit more and convey that in person not just over the phone or by video will help our distribution efforts getting that message really felt by clients and prospects operator our next question comes from steve moss from b riley securities please go ahead with your question q hey everyone this is ph gaige schwartzmann steves associate indiscernible in firm today how is everyone doing tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc good morning well brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc great q so i wanted to start out on credit here the npa has picked up million of that was for the two cre loans im sort of curious could we see any build in reserves moving forward from here due to that or im also sort of curious what the time line is to get some of these loans off of deferrals thank you brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc so if i understand i think maybe two questions in terms of the npas and provision and then the deferral trajectory from here so i think on the provisions we feel that were adequately reserved or wellreserved at this point and we dont see any trends that are referenced by those as we indicated those are unique circumstances so well see anything that those npas will really reflect on the broader portfolio and ill let david give some further guidance but on the deferral basis as we indicated were eight loans million were scheduled to reduce that pretty significantly again here over the next one to two quarters so were really happy and pleased i guess and inspired if you will by the performance of the loans that we had in the deferral portfolio so again the quality of people we work with just really on demonstration here as those people manage their businesses and properties through that but david if you wanted to give more guidance on provision i guess david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah sure id be happy to brian so were very pleased with the investments weve made in talent and our credit culture and it continues to pay dividends we believe that those investments will keep our annual credit costs well below our peer group brian has talked about the fact that we havent seen any notable trends here and while we remain comfortable with our reserve levels and our credit book cecl is a bit unique and the future volatility of cecl with any potential macroeconomic issues that may emerge in the short in the medium term is in terms of dealing with the pandemic were in sort of a transitionary period and factors such as losses across the entire banking sector as loans come off deferral need and a repayment status things that are macroeconomic variables like commercial real estate price indexes vacancy rates and the underlying weaknesses mask or cloak some of the that are ph cloaked by current fiscal policy you also have potential tax policy in here right so theres just a lot going on in with respect to what the cecl model needs to absorb and process and so we feel good about where we are right now we dont see any further losses emerging but were going to be very cautious and prudent before we release any reserves at this point tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 q okay got you yeah thats super helpful and just on it seems like you guys are putting a lot more money into investment securities here sort of curious looking forward are you guys looking to continue that trend and also what are the current yields looking like on the investment securities thank you david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so the current investment portfolio is as jim mentioned aa rated average duration of about years agency securities that are seeing some repayments now but those repayments will slow and the overall yield will continue to improve were probably somewhere around the overall yield of the portfolio at the moment i expect that to pick up a little bit as prepayments slow here over the course of the next few months q thank you thanks for taking my questions and ill pass it off operator our next question comes from michael perito from kbw please go ahead with your question michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc good morning mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good to have you all on this morning i had a question for tim i appreciate you being on today and giving us the update on chartwell i was wondering if you could maybe expand a little bit on your expectations for the your kind of weighted average fee rate going forward it looked like it took a very modest step down in the quarter is that through the mix and some of the trust aum growth you were talking about or is that just a timing issue on revenue recognition just any expanded thoughts there that youre willing to share timothy joseph riddle a managing partner chief executive officer chartwell investment partners llc sure michael how are you michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 timothy joseph riddle a managing partner chief executive officer chartwell investment partners llc it is all about the mix so when you take a look at where we had a lot of success in q1 in terms of not only flows but also in terms of new business a lot of that was on the fixed income side slightly lower fee obviously so thats what drives that average fee rate that again might move around basis point or basis points given the flow and the mix of the new business through the quarter michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc mike you want to keep in mind this is jim that when we acquired chartwell in the average weighted fee was basis points and now its youre aware we had put in place a family of mutual funds and the yield on those mutual funds to the company is higher and that to an extent drove that business and if you look at the portfolio itself it was overwhelmingly when we acquired an institutional business its much more competitive now over of it is retail so that what that is probably going to be a pretty solid number it will rotate between ph and or but its not going to get much better than that and the portfolio the whole portfolio the aum has been diversified meaningfully if you look at it now its about fixed income while before it was probably not much more than when we bought the company and in environments that you find that you experience like we have last year it added stability to the company michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc makes sense thank you guys for that and then as my followup maybe a question for david i apologize if i missed this earlier in the call but i feel like the last couple quarters here ive been ph throwing darts at the board on this fdic insurance expense i was just wondering if you have any clarity in kind of where that when and where that might settle into a more normalized run rate moving forward here especially with the strong deposit growth that you guys are continuing to see david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc sure mike so let me put some context to it the fdic insurance expense was on an annualized basis basis points on average assets in the first quarter thats down from about basis points in the fourth and down from about basis points in the third of last year i think we have shared with ph this group previously that because weve crested over the billion mark the methodology in terms of calculating that that insurance premium is different and we get the benefit of our private banking loan portfolio the lower risk nature of that portfolio in terms of the calculation so you will see the insurance premiums tick up slightly from here based on growth but where we sit right now is probably a pretty good run rate of where well go through the year obviously adjusting a little bit for growth but that that moved from the third quarter to the fourth when we were able to apply it for the first time and then to the first most of that transition is now behind us and this will start to normalize from here tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it so were growing off of kind of the million ph in excess the new methodology makes the back half of the last year a little less relevant from a calculation standpoint david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc exactly michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it well it was good to hear from you all thanks for taking my questions james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc okay take care brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc thanks michael operator operator instructions our next question is a followup from matt olney from stephens please go ahead with your followup matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah thanks for taking the followup just want to circle back on the expense discussion we were just having and just taking a step back operating expenses were sequentially low in the first quarter and you mentioned fdic insurance is one of the reasons the guidance of to growth in was maintained and implies quite a bit of ramp from these levels in the first quarter wed love to hear more about kind of where youd expect to see that ramp in which categories thanks david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so matt we you think about our growth last year and our ability to manage expenses to about we were able to continue to make significant investments last year as we built technology people processes regulatory compliance all to support what we view as responsible growth by the organization for this year our goals continue to be annual growth of loans and deposits of to and revenue of to to support that responsible growth we need to continue to make investments in people process and technology so thats where youll see the primary drivers being in compensation and technologyrelated expenses we believe we can focus on driving that those continued investments and keeping expense growth under youll naturally see as we move through the year improvements in operating leverage operating efficiency ratio the noninterest expense to average assets ratio and return on equity which is above times for the quarter and we believe well get that to double digits by the end of the year so responsible growth a lot of investments were tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 making in people and technology to support that growth regulatory compliancerelated type items and we feel good about the projection that jim had in his remarks of to james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc yes and i would just add around the client engagement client experience piece a lot of those are aligned with the risk management side but a lot of the people and automation and technology that were putting in place will absolutely enhance the client experience so well reduce manual touches to more automated touches so were freeing up our people to focus on higher level of client engagement and more meaningful engagement and also as you can see sort of our te and other client engagement expenses fairly low in the quarter our hope certainly is that were finding ways to continue to engage with clients in person or more meaningfully over the future so well certainly see some increases as we do that as well matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and just a few more housekeeping questions here i guess more on the modeling front it looks like in the first quarter the diluted share count was a little bit lower than expected but at a higher preferred dividend david i think we kind of talked about this a few months could you just kind of remind me of the puts and takes on that in the first quarter and how we should be thinking about that moving forward david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah matt as a recovering accountant i sometimes find theres an inverse relationship between the amount of disclosure and its usefulness we will continue to provide this table on page to you each quarter diluted common shares are about million shares that should stay relatively stable the biggest change this quarter was the share count of restricted stock the amount which was dilutive that fluctuates with the market price and how much what shares are in the money with the improvement in the tristate market price the restricted stock more shares became dilutive and so absent any significant change in terms of restricted stock for the remainder of the year the diluted common share count should stay around million maybe a little higher or lower just based on market fluctuations so well continue to provide this disclosure and continue to try to provide transparency and clarity here matt olney q analyst stephens inc and on the preferred dividend side i think its around million this quarter how will that fluctuate throughout the year david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc that will stay relatively consistent as well it will grow slightly quartertoquarter to the extent that stone point elects to receive the dividend in additional shares versus cash to date they have done that theyve elected additional shares but the overall dividend should stay relatively stable at the first quarter levels tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then just lastly david on the effective tax rate i would love to know kind of how youre thinking about that this year david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so were a little higher than we had hoped to be in the first quarter but we still believe we can get that down to through the year weve got a couple of credits on the horizon that potentially will help us get there if were able to execute and transact on those guides and so guidance of to still holds matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay perfect im all said nice quarter thank you james f getz a chairman of the board chief executive officer director tristate capital holdings inc thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen im showing no additional questions id like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks james f getz chairman of the
