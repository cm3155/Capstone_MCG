conference over to your speaker for today travis lan please go ahead travis lan executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp good morning and welcome to valleys second quarter earnings conference call presenting on behalf of valley today are ceo ira robbins president tom iadanza and chief financial officer mike hagedorn before we begin i would like to make everyone aware that our quarterly earnings release and supporting documents can be found on our company website at valleycom when discussing our results we refer to non gaap measures which exclude certain items from reported results please refer to todays earnings release for reconciliations of these nongaap measures additionally i would like to highlight slide of our earnings presentation and remind you that comments made during this call may contain forwardlooking statements relating to valley national bancorp and the banking industry valley encourages all participants to refer to our sec filings including those found on forms 8k 10q and 10k for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those statements with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis during the second quarter of valley reported net income of million and diluted earnings per share of the sequential reduction in net income was a result of stable pretax preprovision net revenue supported by the positive inflection in net interest income and the elevated loan loss provision while this provision is outside our normal range we believe that this quarter will represent the relative peak in our provisioning last quarter i outlined the planned acceleration of our strategic initiatives aimed at normalizing certain balance sheet metrics which are outliers to peers i am extremely pleased with the significant progress that we have quickly made relative to each of our state of balance sheet goals importantly we have begun to execute on these initiatives without diminishing our future earnings capacity in fact we believe that the further strengthening of our balance sheet will drive stability in our performance and relative value in the market our progress is illustrated in detail on slide by the end of the second quarter both our cre concentration and allowance coverage ratios have already reached the yearend expectations that we laid out just three months valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 ago by limiting our investor cre and multifamily originations and reclassifying certain healthcare loans to the owneroccupied bucket we were able to reduce our commercial real estate concentration ratio to our full year target of around with the backdrop of strong credit performance and stable past due and nonaccrual loan metrics during the quarter our reserve coverage expanded to our nearterm targeted level of above we now anticipate reaching our intermediate term expectation of around by the end of to be clear there is no change to our belief that a coverage ratio of about is appropriate for our risk profile given our analysis of the portfolio and current backdrop this quarters elevated provision in the context of strong credit performance was the result of our conservative decision to place less value on personal guarantees as a mitigating factor in our internal loan risk ratings this shift drove additional loan downgrades into our criticized and classified buckets which each carry higher reserve requirements under our methodology our criticized and classified loans continue to perform and remain current with regards to payment activity while this conservative approach to personal guarantees is reasonable given the current market environment we continue to believe personal guarantees are useful in influencing borrower behavior and in cases of stress these guarantees have proven very useful in limiting chargeoffs and enhancing recoveries throughout our history for this reason we anticipate that in practice personal guarantees will continue to be valuable in minimizing the loss content of our portfolio going forward turning to capital our riskbased ratios improved meaningfully during the quarter despite strong noncre balance sheet growth and only modest retained earnings this growth was primarily the result of a synthetic risk transfer which we executed during the quarter this transaction reduced the riskweighted assets associated with our indirect auto loan business by approximately billion we remain very comfortable with our regulatory capital levels and the significant expansion that we have generated on both a quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear basis slide lays out our expectations for the remainder of we anticipate low singledigit annualized loan growth for the rest of the year consistent with this quarters strong results future loan growth will likely be tilted towards ci and owneroccupied cre as new investor cre originations remain well controlled we anticipate that this growth and the continued repricing of existing assets will support up to growth in net interest income on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year noninterest income should recover from current levels as capital markets activity picks up and we continue to expand our treasury management capabilities noninterest expense remains well controlled though we will see a full quarters impact of the premium expense associated with our risk trade in the third and fourth quarters our tax rate is likely to come in between and for the rest of the year from a credit perspective net chargeoffs are likely to remain around current levels for the rest of the year however i will reiterate that we are confident our provision has peaked and that a level between the first and second quarters provision is a more reasonable quarterly expectation for the remainder of the year these expectations combined with our loan growth outlook implies we will end the year with an acl to loan ratio of around before turning the call over to tom i wanted to highlight the underlying franchise value that we continue to create at valley since the end of we have grown reportable tangible book value by versus for our valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 regional banking peers including the impact of distributed dividends this increases to growth versus respectively this variance reflects our ability to enhance our franchise value without meaningfully diluting tangible book value and overpriced acquisitions or to other aspects to maximize nearterm results customer account growth is another key metric that gauges our ability to build and optimize our franchise value commercial deposit account growth remained strong during the quarter and our stable deposit levels on a quarterly average balance indicates significant stability despite some late quarter movement that temporarily impacted spot balances at the end of the quarter average balances in july have rebounded which further underpins our confidence that net interest income growth will continue we also believe that there is significant value in the geographic diversity that we have developed on both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet at the end of nearly of our commercial loans were concentrated in new york and new jersey that figure has declined to today as a result of our focus in florida and other dynamic commercial markets we continue to develop exceptional serviceoriented banking teams across the country which are focused on generating and enhancing valuable commercial relationships that we have targeted meanwhile at the end of of our deposits were in northeast branches as of the end of the second quarter that number has declined to just we have diverse funding niche businesses and a robust branch network across florida and alabama this diversity helps to insulate our funding base and provides unique and differentiated opportunities to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding over time in conclusion i am extremely pleased with the progress that weve already made towards achieving our stated balance sheet goals we continue to work hard to further position ourselves for growth and high performance as the environment normalizes i am confident that given what we know our provision has already peaked with continued net interest income momentum fee normalization and expense control we expect that our earnings will expand throughout the rest of the year and set us up for continued improvement in with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results after mike concludes his remarks tom mike myself and mark saeger our chief credit officer will be available for your questions thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide illustrates the quarters deposit trends total deposits increased billion compared to the first quarter largely due to higher levels of indirect deposits meanwhile customer balances including on the non interestbearing side were generally stable throughout the quarter this stability enabled us to largely hold the line for the third consecutive quarter from a pricing perspective the next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business line growth trends in our specialty commercial verticals and private banking business was strong during the quarter and partially mitigated late quarter runoff in branch deposits average deposit balances in july are running higher than second quarter levels as customer activity has rebounded from a brief quarterend dip valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 while we do not typically reference deposit team additions as they occur we recently received approval to open a new branch office in beverly hills california this location will be overseen by experienced inmarket leadership and will supplement the delivery of our financial products and services to our existing customer base we are also planning a new branch opening in staten island which is contiguous to our existing metro new york footprint we have over customers in this market already and are extremely excited about the market leadership that we have attracted to accelerate our business development efforts both initiatives will enhance our name recognition in our markets and are expected to contribute to future deposit growth in addition to growing deposits through our specialty commercial vertical which i previously mentioned we believe selective branch expansion supported by experienced inmarket leaders is an attractive option to grow core deposits at a reasonable allin cost and we anticipate a few additional opportunities to come to fruition slide illustrates the drivers of loan growth during the quarter total loans increased almost million driven by roughly annualized ci growth our focus on ci has been a strategic imperative as we work to further diversify our balance sheet this quarters growth came across multiple business lines and geographies and while future growth may be lumpy there are significant opportunities for longerterm growth in this asset class on the commercial real estate side we saw a meaningful shift from investor real estate to owneroccupied real estate during the quarter while the majority of this transition was a result of the reclassification of approximately billion of healthcare loans we continued to benefit from the strategic deemphasis of investor real estate originations this focus will continue to result in lower real estate concentration going forward slide provides additional detail on the composition of our commercial real estate portfolio by property type and geography in general the commercial real estate markets and borrower performance across our footprint remain healthy with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom staying on the cre topic for a moment slide illustrates the contractual maturities of our commercial real estate portfolio we have included the ltv dscr and rate by maturity bucket for your benefit this maturity schedule illustrates the minimal nearterm repricing risk that exists in our portfolio slide highlights the significant positive inflection in both net interest income and net interest margin this quarter this strong performance was the result of both interest income growth and interest expense reductions relative to the first quarter of the year we forecast continued net interest income growth as a result of modest balance sheet growth and the ongoing tailwind associated with asset yield expansion on the funding side we have benefited from targeted deposit cost reductions that were implemented over the last few quarters average noninterest deposits increased modestly during the quarter and despite a brief dip at the quarter end we are seeing additional growth in average noninterest balances already in the third quarter turning to the next slide you can see that noninterest income on an adjusted basis declined compared to the first quarter of roughly of the net decline in fee income was related to the anticipated normalization of tax credit advisory revenues from the first quarters elevated level beyond this we were impacted by a negative valuation adjustment on certain fintech investments which was partially offset by stronger swap fees insurance valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 commissions and bankowned life insurance income we continue to drive growth in our capital markets wealth management and treasury services channels these factors are likely to drive the anticipated growth in fee income for the rest of the year on the following slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter adjusting for our million fdic special assessment and certain other noncore charges noninterest expenses were approximately million on an adjusted basis this represents a very modest increase from both the first quarter of and the second quarter of this was primarily the result of costs related to the credit risk transfer that we executed and higher traditional fdic assessment expense we continue to focus on head count optimization and technology efficiencies to combat the revenue pressure that has occurred as a reminder our noninterest expense for the rest of the year will include roughly million of premium costs related to our risk transfer transaction on slide you can see the continued and notable stability in our nonaccrual and past due loan categories despite the impact of higher rates and isolated stress in the office segment our borrowers continue to generally perform well at the bottom left you can see the lower historical loss content of our portfolio which plays out consistently across cycles we remain confident in our reserve coverage relative to our loss content as illustrated in the charts on the bottom right the next slide illustrates the trend in allowance coverage chargeoffs and provision our allowance coverage ratio continues to expand towards the intermediateterm target and you heard ira describe the drivers of this expansion during the second quarter to reiterate we expect that the allowance to loan loss ratio will reach a level of around based on current market dynamics and our knowledge of the portfolio this expectation implies that our provision has peaked and will likely trend lower over the next few quarters the overwhelming majority of our loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well roughly of the quarters net chargeoffs were the result of a single commercial real estate and single ci credit the ci credit was largely covered by preexisting specific reserve as ira indicated given the current market environment we do anticipate that net chargeoffs will remain close to current levels for the remainder of the year the next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios the quarters elevated provision and modest expansion headwind from the oci impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio weighed on tangible book value growth for the quarter that said we are extremely pleased with the significant growth and our riskbased capital ratios relative to both the prior quarter and the year ago period we are very proud of our ability to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility in shareholderfriendly ways with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question for today comes from frank schiraldi of piper sandler your line is open frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hi frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just wanted to ask ira you mentioned the reserve to loan ratio and essentially i guess youre just getting there early here but in terms of a continued mix shift towards ci i would think that would still tend to put additional pressure on that ratio so it sounds like youre pretty comfortable with the but just kind of curious if you can walk through the thinking there is the idea that criticized and classified begin to moderate here as an offset just curious your thoughts mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp hi this hey frank this is mark saeger i think on the criticized classified front if you see our migration this quarter that was lower than prior quarter and very much associated with what ira mentioned deemphasizing a personal guarantee in our decisioning on internal risk rating i want to make it clear though we think that loans with a guarantee will ultimately have materially better outcomes for the organization and they continue to be very important in our really relationshipbased model within the organization but to your point about ci youre correct in the sense that ci does traditionally carry a higher level of provisioning than cre and thats going to be a portion of the build however in the environment that were in right now with continued higher entry rates there is likely to be a continued modest migration in our cre portfolio into criticized categories frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay but just want so youre still comfortable even in that with that mix shift towards ci in the reserve to loan ratio at about you dont see a need for that to move higher in the near term mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp no the is a continuation of our build and were comfortable with that level valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just as a followup you obviously worked down cre in part through this reclassification and i imagine thats something you guys have been more active on pursuing just curious if theres continued efforts here that could potentially drive more to come and any updated thoughts about now that youre at kind of your yearend level i guess for concentrations on cre your target any updated thoughts on where you could be by the end of or what youre targeting by the end of in terms of concentration thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think we were pretty specific last quarter sort of where we thought from an intermediate basis and getting below ph million was pretty important to us obviously accelerating it if possible is something that were looking at doing but keeping in mind we want to make sure we keep in mind the earnings profile of the organization and as we look to different alternatives making sure that theyre in a shareholderfriendly manner and were not denigrating a future earnings profile so it really is a balance for us as we continue to move forward were really excited about the ability to accelerate some of those initiatives but we have to keep in mind some of the economics associated with different alternatives as well frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the reclassification is that was that like a specific sort of project to move that along is that largely completed or could we see another bucket of that next quarter mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp that was a specific project that we put together specifically related to skilled nursing segment of the portfolio and that was essentially completed in the second quarter frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp how are you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start ira on the net interest income outlook the to i assume thats unannualized growth but i want to confirm that and then i want to ask if we get to rate cuts where do you think you end up in the range travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yeah steven this is travis so youre correct that is unannualized growth that were showing on a quarterly basis going forward our forward guidance assumes two rate cuts consistent with what the implied curve was at ph million so thats factored in there and then i think within that range you could also static rates are captured in that range as well as theres just not much impact or change to our nii guidance dependent on the amount of rate cuts here in the near term steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats helpful and then on slide the commercial real estate that slide is very helpful the billion of commercial real estate that matured was retained did you guys can you walk us through did you need to make concessions there did these move into an extension period or were these full refinance or the borrower put in more equity and these are new commercial real estate loans mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp so on the retained side all of those loans were repriced at current market rates and sized appropriately to our standards youll note we have the modified ph other of million that really represents a modified structure historic tdrtype relationship the billion was all at market terms steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay mark because i guess were hearing some borrowers are just looking for a oneyear extension if you will not necessarily refinancing the loan were any of these that nature mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp yes yeah steven absolutely the duration of some of these transactions were shorter than fiveyear renewals however all of them were done again at current market rates and with normalized amortization steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so they would need to put full equity to get that extension basically valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp sometimes yes sometimes no yeah depending on where the loan stands at maturity steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so then yeah ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp sorry so the equity level would needed to be normal but obviously based on the original loan to value many of the borrowers didnt even need to put in equity steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then final for me on the rwa benefit and the strategy on the auto loans this quarter are you guys looking at other use of synthetic instruments should we expect more of this in the second half or is it done travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yeah steven this is travis look i mean we always kind of analyze whats out there and available i mean i think you see more of these risk transfers being done in the industry its not unique to valley necessarily steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp i think the auto portfolio was the lowhanging fruit to be honest but we continue to analyze other opportunities in other asset classes as well so i think again not just for valley but for the rest of the industry youll see these being used to generate capital efficiency on a goforward basis steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steven operator ph thank you one moment while we prepare for the next question and the next question will be coming from matthew breese of stephens your line is open valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning thank you good morning everybody ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc ira i think you hinted at this but i was hoping to get your thoughts on either selling commercial real estate loans or securitizing loans to accelerate and lower that cre concentration how likely is that type of outcome and if you do end up going that route what would you be willing to tell us in terms of earnings or tangible book value impacts that youd be able to absorb to achieve those goals faster ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think you highlighted the appropriate guardrails matt right i think weve done a good job for a long period of time prioritizing growth in tangible book value and denigrating that tangible book value is something thats important to us and really what that threshold is and once again maintaining an earnings profile thats really set to continue to grow based on where were seeing the balance sheet as well as the net interest margin becomes important to us so it is a toggle as to how we think about the acceleration that said we do think there continue to be a lot of opportunities as to how we can reposition the balance sheet a little bit quicker when not denigrating what that earnings profile is so there are opportunities and we continue to weigh them and we will execute on them when we think it makes good sense not just from a balance sheet mix perspective but also from an earnings profile perspective travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp okay and i know you all over the past handful of quarters have taken a much more handson approach to deposit costs they were only up basis points quarteronquarter can we see deposit costs fall next quarter and have interestbearing liabilities peaked for the cycle michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah its a good question and i think our results for the quarter kind of speak to themselves and were strong when you look at total deposits increased billion and you look at the cost makeup of those deposits total deposit costs as we mentioned earlier were only up basis points but in that category of total deposits brokered costs were flat at ph for both quarters and customer costs actually declined basis point and when you look at inside of that customer portion of it we raised billion of customer deposits at a cost of ph so i think it kind of speaks for itself that the cost reductions that we did along with our ability valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 to generate from our various sources that weve built over the years was very strong and you see that in the numbers this quarter matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then youre not the only bank that is deemphasizing commercial real estate and working towards more ci loan growth are you seeing any deterioration in underwriting of commercial loans youre seeing some loan covenants being given away or tighter spreads id love some commentary on that thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hey matt its tom now we are underwriting on our ci portfolio on the originations but at similar terms and credit metrics that weve underwritten to in the past weve always said were not going to sacrifice credit quality for quick growth and weve been growing ci for the last six years at around annualized and this quarter its a ph annualized and its coming primarily from our specialty niches where we have experience and a reputation in the market as well as in our florida region which is still experiencing solid growth matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay last one for me you have i think million of sub debt reaching its reset date next year any plans there paid off or should we expect some sort of preemptive raise to get ahead of it travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp matt we always monitor that capital markets i mean i think weve kind of issued sub debt every months obviously with some of the dynamics in the industry last year right that the subdebt market and debt capital markets in general have been a little bit slower seeing some strengthening today but i think on a regular basis sub debt will be kind of a part of the capital stack and were always monitoring shareholderfriendly ways to enhance the balance sheet so matthew breese q analyst stephens inc ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator thank you the next question will be coming from manan gosalia of morgan your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to follow up on the reserve question could you talk about what drove the decision to accelerate the reserve build this quarter and specifically what does that mean for are there any specific reserves embedded in that that could drive a reserve ph lead next year if chargeoffs came through or do you expect to stay in that range for the foreseeable future mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp so we there are some specific reserves in there but we foresee staying within the ratio on a go forward and were very comfortable at that level manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and then in terms of the chargeoffs this quarter if you could speak to the couple of credits are there any is there any read across to the rest of the portfolio as i look at the forward nco guide i think its the midpoint of that range is pretty much in line with the second quarter its a little bit higher than the prior quarter so i just wanted to check if does that come from planned actions to reduce concentration is there anything youre seeing in the portfolio or is it just conservatism thanks mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp so as in the remarks by ira again two credits really drove the level of chargeoffs that we see this quarter one of them on the cre side was an office building i point to the granularity that we have in our office portfolio with a ph average loan this loan was a larger cre loan just north of million i would note that in addition to the granularity we have a very small number of larger loans we only have six office loans that are over million one of them is our headquarters and of those six we just have one as classified so we continue to monitor the office portfolio on a regular basis updating metrics on all of our office loans north of million and the migration in the portfolio throughout this year has been disproportionate to office although in the second quarter that has moderated in the office portfolio manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and in terms of the forward ncos does that does a slightly higher level on ncos come from reduced concentration or reducing consideration of the cre book or is it just some conservatism embedded in there mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp it is more cre focused on what were looking at potential chargeoffs customers that are on our radar that have potential for rollover risk in the future which could deteriorate debt service coverage on a goforward basis so we valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 continue to keep those on our radar and note that that they may or may not lead to future chargeoffs down ph there manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from ph steve mcgratty of im sorry kbw your line is open q great thanks a lot of discussion from some of your competitors this quarter and last quarter just about portfolio reviews in terms of provisioning and reserve build outlook im interested in kind of what youve done not only this quarter but in the last couple of quarters to give a deeper look into some of the cre book to get to that peak provision comment thanks mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp so if you recall from our first quarter call we looked at the vast majority of the portfolio through the end of the first quarter with updated information on all those customers the migration this quarter again as mentioned was related to our view of the benefit of a personal guarantee within risk rating and really deemphasizing that on a go forward basis so our review was proactive and mostly completed in the first quarter and weve essentially gone through the vast majority of our exposure to date ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think one of the things that i would add to it is this isnt just internally value looking at it weve engaged with third parties to come in and assess the portfolio as well just to make sure that our view is aligned with the outside view as well q great thank you and then just a followup could you provide the criticized classified linked quarter and also this quarter i dont know if i saw it in the deck thanks travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yeah it will come out in the q we had a migration of around million this quarter which is down from million in the prior quarter and more details on that will be in the q q all right thanks guys valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from steve moss of raymond james your line is open steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp good morning steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc starting on the liquidity build here you guys added broker deposits and investment securities kind of curious how much higher do you expect to take the investment securities portfolio and maybe continue to add broker deposits travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp i think in general there will be a growth tailwind on the securities portfolio but this quarter was certainly more outsized than what youve seen look i think part of the reason for that is we have this additional cost associated with the risk transfer trade so a small modest leverage strategy to help offset the cost there was on our mind its done in a capitalefficient way were buying ginnie mae securities with zerorisk weight so thats kind of important to what were doing here so i think over time it migrates higher but i dont think there will be any rash actions candidly on the securities portfolio steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate that and then on going back to the total capital here you guys are as of quarter end just curious do you have any short or intermediateterm targets as to where you want that to go ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think from a macro basis were definitely pretty pleased with where the regulatory capital ratios are we did give some guidance as to where we think the cet1 number needs to get to and were still focused on making sure from a longerterm perspective that we get to over on that number steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate that and then in terms of the commercial real estate that repriced this quarter just maybe just going back to that kind of curious what is the what is your view of full market rate or fair market rate for commercial real estate repricing these days valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah its tom steve it really depends on the asset class and segment the metrics on loantovalue debt service coverage and such we have spreads in those classes as high as basis points probably as low no lower than basis points so it really depends on the asset class duration of metrics ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah and i think on a macro basis the average spread that we put was about ph so we think thats probably indicative and i think as we alluded to earlier these were done in market terms when it comes to what the loan to value coverage should look like the debt service coverage ratio as well as what those spreads should look like travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp okay i appreciate that and maybe just kind of circling back to the deemphasis here of the personal guarantee was that done kind of just curious as to the rationalization there was it regulatory driven or is it just that youre seeing customer borrower cash flows deteriorate here and whats the dynamic there to make that change here mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp and this is mark we really took that option to have a conservative look at portfolio while historically the performance that we have and what were seeing to date for loans with the guarantee versus those without is clearly stronger we focused our risk ratings on an unadjusted primary source of repayment and so really hyper focused on debt service coverage as being a primary driver of our ratings steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great i really appreciate all the answers thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for the next question next question is from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thanks good morning you hear me okay ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah definitely valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay maybe for mark or tom back on slide and that upper left box it seems like a good outcome with only million modified curious if that outcome was surprising at all to you and when you look at the cadence of whats coming do you expect similar type outcomes over the next few quarters than what you just experienced this past quarter mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp i think not a surprise for us who live with the portfolio in a forwardlooking way we point to our conservative underwriting our initial sizing of loans so that by time of maturity we see reduced principal amount through amortization improved noi on the majority of asset classes outside of office and rentstabilized multifamily were seeing strong metrics in retail industrial and market rate multifamily in our primary markets so noi growth coupled with prudent sizing at origination on these loans were not so surprised by the good results that were seeing in the refinancing side ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp maybe jon just one thing i wanted to add to that i think when you look at the bottom of that chart we talk about the borrower contractual rate there and i know thats been a big issue for many within the industry is theres been a significant increase in what that rate is for many of these borrowers as they readjust for us youre looking at a rate obviously for whats coming due in third quarter of at ph so there really isnt a huge adjustment for many of the borrowers and you can see what that looks like as we continue to move forward so i think one of the common issues for many of our peers out there as they have to reset these borrowers to higher rates and what that does to the underlying debt service coverage ratio really isnt as significant for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah thats a good point maybe for mike or travis maybe an obvious answer but the higher end and the lower end of the quarterly nii growth anything you would call out for us to think about in terms of how you get to the higher end or the lower end on that guide travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp now we just know theres a diversity of opinion maybe on the outcome for interest rates and theres only ph had a slight impact on our nii at the end of the day but there is nothing material i mean also the other factor would obviously be giving ourselves a range of growth we gave you growth guidance of low single digits and so that can mean a couple of different things and that would be factored in there as well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then just last one you guys talked earlier about the ci growth maybe being more lumpy or erratic can you talk a little bit about the pipelines there and what and it feels like its going to be commercial driven loan growth in that cre so just help us understand what the pipeline looks like thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp okay jon its tom pipeline actually increased quarteroverquarter and the pipeline is very stable growing were seeing a lot of it coming out of those relationships specialty national businesses as well as our florida region steady in the northeast but a higher percent growth on both what we originated in the past quarter and what our pipeline is looking at going forward so we expect to maintain the guidance of what we put out in the low single digits for the second half of the year driven primarily by ci jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thanks guys operator thank you one moment for the next question and our next question will be coming from jared shaw of barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks maybe just going back to the criticized and classified what was the what would the growth have been without the reclassification of personal guarantee mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp hey jared this is mark i dont have the breakout specifically but the majority of the migration this quarter was related to our approach on personal guarantees jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thats good thanks and then just sort of following up on ph chris question was the did you see have you seen weaker performance than expected maybe on some of the loans that have gone nonperforming with personal guarantees was that part of the driver of that change mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp no absolutely not again this is just a conservative approach to risk rating and specific provisioning what weve seen to date is consistent with our historic record that those loans with guarantees do have more positive outcomes and it continues to be an important part of our credit structure and will continue to be on a goforward basis jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks for that and shifting to the deposits i think tom had said that july averages were trending higher was that is that trending higher than the average second quarter or the end of period second quarter or both maybe on the deposit side valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yeah its relative we were we made the statement relative to the average for the second quarter and from a customer perspective that would be for the end of period as well so customer deposits on an average basis in july are slightly higher than the end of the quarter jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then just finally for me when you look at the delta and the rates that youre getting on your customer deposits versus your brokered deposits and then i just was checking what your specials are at sort of ph why not pay up a little bit more on the customer side because it feels i dont know it seems like youd be able to get something still cheaper than the brokered side is there a reason that youre leaning in more on the brokered side here versus paying up a little bit more on core customer accounts ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp its obviously a conversation we have a lot internally with regard to our deposit pricing committees i think a lot of it has to do on what potential migration looks like from a relationship client perspective keep in mind many of these clients have been here for a very long time they have sizable deposits with us and if they see a higher rate many of them want that higher rate as well i think the other piece is the broker have a shorterterm duration and the ability to think about where maybe market interest rates are going and to keep short on the curve is probably a positive for us jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks for that appreciate the questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator this conclude todays qa ph session ill pass the call over to ira for closing remarks please go ahead ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i want to thank everyone for joining us today and for the interest in valley and we look forward to talking to
