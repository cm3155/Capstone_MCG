everyone earlier today we released our fourth quarter and fullyear financial results as i reflect on the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the worlds investors and for our industry and i am proud of how we carefully navigated state street through various headwinds while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda we focused and delivered on that agenda in three key areas achieve strong sales wins across our businesses drive strategic change in our investment services business and remained disciplined on productivity and broader cost management further on that last point during we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in and the years state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 ahead we took these many actions all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders which helped to drive full year earnings growth excluding notable items the worlds investors state street and our industry faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in in the first quarter turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution of several banks which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market move seen in decades in the second quarter anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence helping to drive equity markets higher however as we progressed into the third quarter and as the federal reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in ph years in july the prospect of higherforlonger rates led to a substantial selloff in bond markets with the us 10year treasury yield exceeding in october for the first time since the global financial crisis rate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns cause equities to struggle then during the fourth quarter the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the federal reserve signaled a pivot to lower interest rates this year in sum while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter daily average global equity markets only increased by lowsingle digits in providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year and even in such an eventful year equity and fx market volatility continued to contract creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses slide of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year beginning with our financial performance full year earnings per share was or excluding notable items yearoveryear excluding notable items eps growth was supported by billion of common share repurchases a record level of nii continued growth of our front office software and data business and higher securities finance revenues the combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth which was still well controlled we continued to build business momentum and position state street for longer term success to that end we achieved a number of important accomplishments in as you can see on slide a key highlight of todays results is the clear progress we are making on innovation and advancing product capabilities which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead within the investment services business we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals we unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas realizing the full potential of our alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth particularly in our core back office custody encouragingly as i just noted todays results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth in the future as we built upon the million of new servicing fee sales in the third quarter by recording million of new servicing fee wins in which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 from its inception we have noted that alpha will further establish broaden and deepen client relationships positioning state street as our clients essential partner alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of state streets capability as a true one state street solution for our clients from front to back was an important year for alpha software delivery last two quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module which propel crd and alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward in we recorded our first alpha for private markets client and in the fourth quarter we continued alphas momentum by deepening relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording four new alpha wins while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales within our global markets business even as low volatility created a headwind we continue to see proof points of our very strong market position for example in its fx awards euromoney magazine named state street as the winner across four important categories including the best fx bank for real money clients we also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading firm cf global trading at global advisors we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving management fee growth in the coming years as a result we saw encouraging business momentum with ga setting a number of growth records in a number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead for example in q4 ga recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows including record quarterly flows within our spdr etf franchise amounting to a capture of of total global etf flows in q4 and ending with a record level of total etf assets under management our cash business had an exceptional year delivering record annual flows in with institutional money market fund aum also reaching a record overall we gained market share in a number of key areas including institutional money market funds and us lowcost equity and fixed income etfs turning to our efficiency and productivity efforts underlying expense growth was wellcontrolled in with full year expenses increasing excluding notable items q4 expenses excluding notable items rose just quarteronquarter reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realized productivity growth remains a key priority for us to that end we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model as we previously announced we are streamlining our operations in india weve now assumed control of one our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in the spring we expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of state streets global operations improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 turning to slide of our presentation you can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business momentum indicators which eric will shortly take you through in more detail before i conclude my opening remarks i would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength which has enabled us to return a substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters for example over the last five quarters to the end of december we have returned billion of capital to our shareholders as we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return in it is currently our intention to return approximately of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases subject to market conditions accordingly as we announced this morning our board of directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to billion with no set expiration date to conclude while was an eventful year we finished strongly in which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into this year we remain highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results our goals are clear we must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive fee operating leverage in all while returning capital to our shareholders we are laserfocused on these goals now let me hand the call over to eric wholl take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone before i begin my review of our fourth quarter and fullyear results let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on slide which collectively totaled million pretax or of eps first we recognized an fdic special assessment of million which is reflected in other expenses second we recognized million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program as we had indicated in december the bulk of this action primarily relates to the severance of around employees our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses we expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly six quarters and begin this quarter with roughly twothirds of the benefit occurring in these actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for and in subsequent years turning to slide i will begin my review with both our fourth quarter and fullyear financial results as you can see on the table total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarteronquarter the yearon year quarter and for the full year the slight market appreciation notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility central bank pivots and geopolitical concerns pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year in terms of our more durable revenues we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business which was up on a fullyear basis and on the yearonyear quarter state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 in terms of areas that have begun to rebound management fee performance was down for the full year at minus but has begun to rebound with an up result for the yearonyear quarter as flows picked up and we gained share back office servicing fees was challenged for much for the year as the client transactional activity was muted but has started to turn positive and is up this quarter as weve seen a recent lift in equity markets and of course we continue to be affected by industrywide headwinds in our global markets businesses given the low levels of volatility in the fx markets and specials activity in agency lending throughout the year nii has been tough to predict and surprised to the positive this quarter compared to third quarter ill turn to that in a few minutes expenses were wellcontrolled in the quarter as were continuing to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth relative to the year ago total expenses exnotables were up yearonyear and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed this expense control coupled with the repositioning actions i just mentioned prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in finally despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment we delivered fullyear eps growth of excluding notable items this was supported by share repurchases a record level of nii and the growth of our front office software and data business which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions turning now to slide we saw periodend auca increase by on a yearonyear basis and sequentially yearonyear the increase in auca was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business quarteronquarter auca increased primarily due to higher period end market levels at global advisors period end aum increased yearonyear and was up sequentially largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows notably as ron mentioned earlier and ill describe momentarily in fourth quarter ga recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of billion which sets us up well for at the center right weve also added a table with market volatility indices which we believe can be useful indicators of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees specials activity and agency lending and flows and margins in fx trading on slide now on the left side of the page youll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up yearonyear primarily from higher average equity markets partially offset by pricing headwinds lower client activity and adjustments in a previously disclosed client transition sequentially total servicing fees were down primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines on the bottom left of the slide we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business we were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of million this quarter the highest in many recent years primarily reflecting the enhancements of our sales processes and product offerings including in north america where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance these servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of million and underscores the progress were making towards stronger sales performance recall our goal for is even higher at million to million in servicing fee sales for the year state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 finally we had million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end up million yearonyear and million quarteronquarter we expect about half of this to install in we also had trillion of auca to be installed at period end turning to slide fourth quarter management fees were million up yearonyear primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into nii and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided etf flows relative to the third quarter management fees were flat mainly driven by higher performance fees offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into nii and the impact of the strategic etf product suite repricing initiative as you can see on the bottom right of the slide our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broadbased business momentum across each of its businesses in etfs we had record quarterly net inflows of billion driven by record net inflows into spy as well as the spdr portfolio us lowcost suite experiencing consistent market share gains in our institutional business we saw quarterly net flows of billion primarily driven by defined contribution products and lastly across our cash franchise we saw quarterly cash net inflows of billion primarily into money market funds which contributed to the record total full year cash net inflows of billion and institutional money market fund market share gains turning now to slide fourth quarter fx trading services revenue was down yearonyear ex notables and sequentially relative to the period a year ago the decrease was mainly due to lower fx spreads from muted market volatility offset by slightly higher volumes quarteronquarter the decrease primarily reflects lower direct fx revenues from muted volatility fourth quarter securities finance revenues were down yearonyear due to lower agency balances partially offset by higher agency spreads higher specials activity and prime services revenue moving on to software and processing revenues fourth quarter fees were up yearonyear and sequentially largely driven by crd which ill turn to shortly finally other fee revenue for the quarter increased million yearonyear primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change partially offset by the impacts associated with the devaluation of the argentinian peso moving to slide youll see on the left panel that fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased yearonyear primarily as a result of the continued saas implementations and conversions driving software enabled and professional services revenue growth sequentially front office software and data revenue was up primarily driven by higher onpremise renewals and golive implementations turning to some of the alpha business metrics on the right panel we were pleased to report four more alpha mandate wins in the quarter which means seven wins for the full year state street alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering to to years state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 weve also gone live with three more alpha clients which brings us to six for the year which sets us up well for and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers fourth quarter arr increased yearoveryear driven by 20plus saas client implementations and conversions and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at million turning to slide fourth quarter nii increased yearonyear but increased sequentially to million the yearonyear decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates sequentially the increase in nii performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning as well as higher deposits and loan balances the nii results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected as both interest bearing and noninterestbearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal but the feds quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the feds reverse repo operation which seems to have resulted in clients leaving higher bank deposit balances its hard to know how deposits will trend but were pleased with this higher step off going into the first quarter of on the right side of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter average deposits increased quarteronquarter with noninterestbearing deposits up for the quarter turning to slide fourth quarter expenses excluding notable items increased yearonyear or exfx sequentially fourth quarter expenses were up only as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company including alpha private markets core custody and tech and ops process improvements and automation on a linebyline basis and yearoveryear ex notables compensation and employee benefits increased primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits partially offset by lower contractor spend in performancebased incentive comp information systems and communications expenses increased mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits transaction processing increased mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs occupancy increased largely due to the absence of an episodic saleleaseback transaction in the prior period and other expenses were up sequentially flat yearonyear mainly reflecting higher marketing expense and professional fees lastly let me spend a moment on head count as we discussed in the third quarter as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives weve streamlined our operating model in india and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations joint ventures and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring this consolidation continues the transformation of state streets global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contractor services and in the years ahead as we simplify our fragmented operating model as you would expect consolidating the first joint venture increased our fte head count roughly in the quarter as we insource global capabilities however these costs were already in our expense base and reported state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 historically under the comp and benefits line these actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for moving to slide on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide as you can see we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels which came in above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of was up basis points quarteronquarter largely driven by episodically lower rwa and improvement in aoci partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases the decrease in interest rates during december after the completion of our buyback contributed about basis points to our cet1 ratios and some market factors over the last week of december conveniently contributed roughly another basis points to the rwa endofperiod print going forward i would expect the rwa to run at higher levels to support our various businesses our lcr for state street corporation was a healthy and for state street bank and trust in the quarter we were quite pleased to return over million to shareholders consisting of million of common share repurchases and over million in common stock dividends lastly as we announced earlier today our board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to billion with no expiration date turning to slide before i start let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year let me cover our full year outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter both of which have more potential for variability than usual given the macroeconomic environment were operating in in terms of our current macro expectations as we stand here today we expect global equity markets to be flat pointtopoint in which equates to the daily average being up about yearoveryear our interest rate outlook for largely aligns with the forward curve as of yearend which i would note continues to move we expect to see modest increase in fx and equity volatility which should support slightly higher fx trading services fees this year but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter and we expect currency translation to have less than percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation and i would remind you that a weaker us dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses so we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately to exnotable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by higher market levels and continued business momentum and continued strong growth in front office software and data this includes a headwind of a little less than one percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition regarding the first quarter of we currently expect fee revenue to be up on a yearoveryear basis with servicing fees expected to be up management fees up to and front office software and data expected to be up over largely due to increased saas new business and conversions and onpremise renewals we expect full year nii to be down about on a yearoveryear basis compared to a record this is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels which are obviously difficult to predict regarding the first quarter of after a significant stepup in we expect nii to be flat to down on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 turning to expenses as you can see on the walk on page we expect full year expenses exnotables will be up about on a nominal basis in sic driven largely by our continued investment in the business which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth billion which is approximately times last years gross savings level regarding the first quarter of we expect expenses ex notable items to be up to on a yearover year basis keeping in mind the seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter as a reminder we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage excluding notable items for full year given the projected growth in fee revenue and wellcontrolled expenses finally we expect taxes should be in the range for and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer director state street corp thank you eric operator we can now open the call to questions question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning everybody thanks for all the details i was hoping we could start with unpacking some of the nii dynamics and i guess i appreciate the uncertainty when it comes to deposits but eric maybe talk a little bit about what drove the upside in the fourth quarter in deposit levels and if you have a view on what sort of seasonal versus more kind of core client franchise driven and maybe give us some insight on where you expect balances to ultimately stabilize in the back half of eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure alex its eric let me share with you the texture we have but ill just say deposits and deposit levels continue to be volatile they surprised to the upside and in particular we saw a nice uptick in deposits into september october we actually saw on the nib side a downtick in november and then a large uptick again in december so the averages came in up for the quarter which made a big difference billion of nib for a month is worth million and you kind of multiply through and that quickly adds up as we had a spread in december of billion billion relative to our expectations and at the same time we also saw interestbearing deposits up now some of that is just our regular way engaging with clients some of that is they are leaving more deposits with us and i think you did see in the fed reports the banking system deposits are up quarteronquarter from third quarter to fourth quarter state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 so it does seem like theres something happening in the market thats creating a little more stability a little bit of buoyancy theres some amount of seasonality that we always tend to see in at the end of the year as folks accumulate cash sometimes to pay dividends and etfs in the next year so its just hard to read but thats what played out and it played out better through the quarter and through the end if i then try to look forward its very hard to look forward for the year wed like to operate and expect to operate in the deposit range of billion to billion thats our kind of goal a lot of that is just client engagement and helping put their cash to work and sometimes they put cash to work in deposits in repo in money market sweeps but theres a category each one of those is an important category and outlet for clients and what were seeing is clients using all the ill call it all the above right including just holding treasury securities so that we expect to continue and we think deposits will be roughly in this zone in the first quarter whats a little harder to read is just how noninterestbearing deposits play out we do expect those to continue to flow downward they tend to flow downward for our clients with the largest funds those are the ones that have been floating down over the last two years so we continue to see that expectation there continues to be a little bit of repricing that plays out into the first quarter or two as well and thats why i guided on an nii basis to flat to down for the first quarter just to give you a little bit of an indication but we expect that to be roughly on flattish deposits alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got it very helpful my followup sticking with deposits is around just deposit beta as we start to sort of enter the rate cutting cycle so hoping you could articulate maybe what youre assuming for deposit beta on the way down in your nii guidance and then broadly how we should think about sort of the cadence of deposit betas as we progress through the rate cutting cycle into the back half maybe but just curious to know kind of high or the upper at the beginning lower towards the end or the opposite eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp alex its an important topic because its how we interact with our clients its how we price our products its how the industry has operated in for many years i think you know that our deposit betas on a cumulative basis have climbed quite a bit in the us theyre or so cumulatively since the start of the cycle in euros its around cumulatively in pound sterling closer to to so theyre clearly moved up what certainly happens as and ill say when if and when rates fall is the deposit betas reverse theres some amount of symmetry now do they reverse instantaneously we want to be careful with our clients we want to be fair but we do think that over multiple quarters and certainly over any realistic timeframe the fed cuts and theres got to be an adjustment now part of that happens because we have a good bit of our deposits that are indexed to markets right theyre indexed to market indicators there are quite a few that are indexed with a spread and then there is a small amount now that has a transactional kind of ill call it administered feature but youll generally see a broad amount of symmetry in deposits down versus up state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 i think what you do need to keep in mind is that our asset sensitivity and liability sensitivity though are somewhat different between the international markets and in the us right in international markets because those cumulative betas are still in the to range were still asset sensitive so we make more money with increases in rates and we actually nii will trim down with decreases in rates and thats where were most thats our interest rate sensitivity today on the us we have a slight positive bias towards being liabilitysensitive but its still relatively slight id almost call it neutral so part of what were doing is just navigating this interest rate environment its not exactly clear when the rates come its not clear whether the us cuts before europe or vice versa and part of what well do is actively manage our portfolios to try to take advantage of whats coming at the same time well price our deposits fairly and prudently alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great very helpful thanks very much operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions i think maybe some of what you just said on the nonus side might explain this but when we think about triangulating the minus to the fact that is either going to be flat going down a little on nii it sort of suggests that your exit rate by the time you get to the based on what you can see today its probably going to be rather low am i reading correctly in thinking that its that nonus piece and thats going to drive some of that weakness and am i extrapolating the comments correctly to think that we could see a little bit more backend weighted decline for nii eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric i think you got the right general pattern framed in the area of nii clearly we have a very strong step off in particular in december but in the fourth quarter which will flow into first quarter and then we expect a trending down we had a couple of well probably earlier earlier last year so a couple of quarters ago i described an nii range of million to million and we think well get into that range the top end of that range by around the third quarter but its a little bit hard to know the exact shape we just but youve got the right direction of travel and then we expect some stabilization in the second half of next sic this year maybe around the top half the middle half of that range just really hard to tell exactly where and when if you step back and ask what are the underlying drivers there are really three drivers that continue to be important in terms of tailwinds we continue to have long rates playing through the portfolio and the investment portfolio balances as they recoupon at higher rates thats particularly important in the first half of the year a little less so in the second half of the year but that continues through as a positive you then have as you mentioned short rates starting to come down and because of our sensitivity position across the global markets that does start to have a headwind impact on nii as those cuts continue to come through state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 now well see whats the pattern and pace of us versus international cuts and i think right now weve pegged to the forward which shows a lot of consistency in symmetry but well see if that really happens because you can see inflation expectations keep moving around literally daily weekly and then the third feature is just client deposits its a mix and while we expect client deposits to be in that zone of billion billion they might bump up above that a little below that but theyll be in that broad zone the mix will continue to shave down out of noninterest bearing over the next quarter or two we think its hard to again to predict and then theres were working through the final stages of some of our interestbearing deposit repricing those seem to have taken a little longer in some cases than we expected thats okay that means we accrete income but those continue to come through and theyll play through in the first quarter or two as well and then thats what kind of brings us to some level of reasonable stability in the back half of the year brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for all that texture eric its very very helpful and by the way i apologize ph background noise that i hear second question a bit more strategic so we saw a flurry of bitcoin etf launches here recently it didnt seem like you all actually landed any of those servicing opportunities so i want to confirm whether my early read on that is right and given the magnitude of the investment and the focus youve made on digital assets what did you learn if you guys missed on that and is that what led to the restructuring of the digital asset group and what should we see as a change from that restructuring ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp so brennan there were launched on the day that the or day after the sec gave approval and we actually service three of them and i think were the only ones that servicing across three different digital custodians so we helped three of the major players make this happen so were quite active in the space and as youd expect we do everything for each of those three except for the actual custody for the reasons that i think you know so no were very active in the space it was what did we learn i mean its early what i think everybody is watching out for is theres a lot of players that went into the market some of them with some existing high levels of assets what will be interesting to see over time is does it actually consolidate how does it work in terms of the who the buyers are institutional versus retail versus intermediary but these are early days and it was good to get the uncertainty cleared up and for all this to get launched and were keen to be part of it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 yeah ron thanks for clarifying pure custody versus the servicing very very helpful ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yeah and just to clarify its i mean i think everybody knows this but i mean right now its extremely difficult for a bank to do pure custody because of the capital requirements that are imposed on a bank i mean its basically capital so therefore virtually everybody is working with some kind of digital custodian a nonbank digital custodian but all of the other parts of the ecosystem which were quite familiar with we are participating in operator your next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much so big flows in ssga which is great to see these things are unpredictable but i am curious on if you have any thoughts towards sustainability of maybe it would be the color of what clients are buying what clients i mean im sorry what flavors of etf are they the average fee and what youre specifically doing differently on the distribution front and education front to get at those flows thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yes so there are a number of things going on there in the fourth quarter glenn and throughout i think as weve noted and certainly you all would have observed there was it was most of the year with some episodic exceptions it was a riskoff environment that changed in fourth quarter somewhat as predicted once investors got a sense of where interest rates were going as they did when the fed communicated in the third quarter more or less a pause i think that started activity going so much of the activity late in the year would have been the kind of classic risk on lets put positions on quickly benefiting the highly liquid spdr core spy in the sector etfs but underlying it and throughout the year the lowcost etfs which represent different investors these would be the ultimate holders here tend to be individuals theyre often advised by an intermediary like an ria so its very sticky and we have continued to build share there both in equity and fixed income low cost across the board fixed income is seeing a dramatic growth i think theres increasing acceptance both by retail investors and institutional investors that the etf is a good vehicle to hold fixed income and youre just seeing that asset allocation moving that way and then finally active etfs of all sort youre seeing growth in and its been a long time coming as you know its been over a decade on how is this actually going to play out and its ironic how its playing out and that everybody is just taking their standard investment strategy and putting it in active etf we benefit some of that on the ga side in terms of what theyre doing in fixed income but we benefit from it greatly on the servicing side because were very very not to overuse the word active in the active etf servicing space and we believe youll see a lot more growth there as core funds and core offerings of wellknown asset managers either get converted to etfs or launch as etfs state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 so were really pleased on the ga side in terms of what drove it i think it was the next part of your question i mean part of it was much more focused and resources dedicated to the various intermediary channels i mean we our roots are in the institutional channels but the lots of the growth is in the intermediary channel so thats part of it and then as we talked about i believe last quarter we took a hard look at pricing particularly in the so called lowcost etfs and recognizing their durability felt that it was worth the investment to reprice them to continue to gain market share because they tend to be very very sticky glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats a lot of detail its perfect i appreciate it ill go quickly on the followup its the same question just different on the servicing front happy with the wins you noted maybe we could just drill down i know its not huge yet but the private markets piece of the servicing wins im curious if you want to tell us how much it was but more importantly what it is and how is it one client or is it multiple clients im curious on how the private markets servicing space is developing thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp no no its both to answer the last part of it first glenn its certainly not one client i mean this is a space that weve invested in and were well known in and we see a secular trend here where its so many of these operations are held inside firms are highly bespoke often sitting in very expensive locations and as the product sets have become more complicated i mean its following a path that the active longonly industry followed years ago was planning to do all this stuff inside when it was just a couple of products they are fairly straightforward thats not whats happening now products are more complicated as you start to think about the structures that enable high net worth individuals to participate in it youve got that added complexity and then oftentimes theres side investments that are permitted et cetera so its very complicated it lends itself to outsourcing its still very much an insourced business so we see lots of potential growth in it its fee characteristics are different positive in the sense that the fees are higher but also the fees get fully recognized when the fund is fully invested so part that we pay a lot of attention to is whats the expected actual one money raised and then draw down and how do we do our best to match our expenses to that but were very excited about the business much of the new investment product investment that eric talked about in the guide includes further strengthening of our position there theres innovation in there and we our goal is to continue to set moats around us so we can continue to excel at it eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and glenn its eric id just add privates has been a real strong area of growth for us weve described it as up in different quarters so its a big part of our growth agenda as we this past year and then this coming year as we take our sales goals up the million to million at least a quarter of that plus is going to be around privates and thats whats going to help us continue to drive privates growth we think in the plus range in terms of yearonyear revenue so its an area that i think weve actually broadly with both large and small and midsize its actually well distributed and its got a good mix of us europe and asia sales coming through as well state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yes as well as glenn its not just private equity its private equity venture private credit is booming and for every bank that complaints about whats going to happen with regulation and the fact that its pushing activity out of the banking system thats going right into the private credit area and we should be the beneficiary of that growth glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi appreciate all that thank you operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi eric hi ron ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric can you share with us i know you and ron werent at state street years ago but your comments about the net interest income outlook and just how volatile it is due to whats going on in the bond market with the federal reserve and their balance sheet are there any indicators youre monitoring that we could look at that might be able to give us a better insight to when net interest income for state street might be more predictable on a goforward basis eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric i take a sigh when i think about this question i think the predictability is partly around fed actions right this is the highest rate level that weve seen in years and also the if i go back couple of years the lowest rate level weve probably seen in two decades as well right so weve kind of were at these wide bookends relative to really the since the i want to say the turn of the century right thats really created this volatility can we manage that and mitigate well we do try to on a sustain on a regular basis match off deposit deposit tenor rate characteristics with the asset side of the portfolio and we do that with duration the challenge is if you take too little duration you have even more volatility if you have to take too much duration on the asset side of the portfolio youve got more aoci risk and so our tools to stabilize work up to a point and then have some negative implications so i dont really see a way to turn what wed like to have i dont see a way to turn this into just a flywheel of metronome that moves at a certain pace and its just a feature of what we do and part of it is our institutional state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 deposits have somewhat more asset sensitivity or liability sensitivity to rates relative to a very simple regional bank so well tend to have a little more but thats part of the industry thats i think were in line with peers gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good ron in your prepared remarks you talked about the success and the momentum youre having with the alpha product in the servicing business in the investment services business i should say is there any capacity constraints that youve got to be careful about if the momentum continues or is it almost now when you got plenty of bandwidth to handle future growth ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yes i would say that the capacity constraint has been particularly with these large complicated client the really large ones some of which are well most of which are still being onboarded the capacity strength has been around onboarding over the past year in particular weve gotten better at that you can if you just look at that number we were roughly at about as i recall trillion in assets to be onboarded and were now down to trillion so you can see were getting better at that the real constraint to be specific about it tends to be and how quickly do you onboard the middle office element to that because that often requires engineering and by that i mean engineering with the client because ultimately thats a client and its like any other kind of industrial outsourcing a client has an operation those things in a particular way wants to outsource that element of it to us were not interested in taking somebodys mess for less i mean we need to actually work with them to engineer it in a way where as much of it as possible is standardized and that the customization is limited to the kinds of user interfaces or how things are actually applied and weve just gotten better at that over time so i would say looking forward we dont see that as being a meaningful constraint gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator your next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc good afternoon just maybe a followup on the outside of sort of the private markets youve had youve ramped up pretty quickly in terms of getting to your million of net of new servicing fee wins and maybe if private markets are a quarter can we talk a little bit about the other three quarters where youve seen success whats worked what hasnt worked and what kind of opportunity set do you see maybe even get above the million ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp jim its ron i mean its no one thing but a lot of really important things across the board to ramp up our execution where were seeing it to answer the first part of your question is the core investment manager state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 segment still remains strong and active for us and as some of those firms are facing the same kind of market that everybody else is theyre more interested than actually trying to do more with us and do different things with us a little bit of a resurgence in the asset owner marketplace and in particular amongst asset owners that arent just pure asset allocators meaning theyre managing some assets themselves or truly actively asset allocating doing not just listening to a consultant telling them what to do but either managing money or at a strategic and tactical level allocating assets which again requires support but in all cases what were doing is were really focused on ensuring that the back office part of all this comes with and comes with it in a timely fashion right because as i was saying earlier when i was talking to gerard the thing that takes a long time or a longer time to onboard would be the middle office the outsourcing element of it onboarding back office is pretty easy pretty straightforward and it in almost all instances comes on in a pretty healthy incremental margin given the scale activities to it and then finally just to talk about regions we have invested heavily in the capabilities in all of our regions where you see the probably the most impact from that over the last couple of years has been just the very good growth that were seeing in asia pacific and really all parts of asia pacific from australia north to japan and everything in between the us weve talked about in the past we were not pleased with where we were in this past year particularly the second half of the year were actually reasonably pleased with how weve done europe has always been strong to us it was a little softer in but again a very strong pipeline but that regional focus where were actually pushing accountability down into the country and regional level and making sure that its very clear who is responsible for what sharing obviously not just the technology and the product but the best practices in how you move these things forward but very much decentralizing the accountability jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats all really helpful and maybe eric just a quick one on the held to maturity book still yielding just a little over can you kind of walk us through the maturity profile of that how long we start to see some pickup in or turnover and reinvestment benefits from that portfolio eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah its eric the way i describe it is weve got a natural rolloff in that portfolio its about billion a year so it plays out and thats related to the maturity in the latter so that will come down over the next couple of years as that happens because as you say its at a lower coupon relative to our average right our average portfolio yields are in the range theres real pickup that comes through that line at least for the next couple of quarters i guess is probably for the next couple of years even because once rates stabilize we do think that well also get some steepness in the yield curve and that will help through so there are some benefits coming that way its also a portfolio that obviously will insulate us from rate moves i dont think in the next few years this is the last downcycle versus upcycle and that well see and so it will serve its purpose then as well jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right very helpful color thanks operator your next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so eric i wanted to start off with a question just on the fee guidance and benchmarking your historical fee performance versus the guidance youve struggled to at least meet or exceed the guide in the absence of significant equity market gains sorry can you guys hear me okay eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc im sorry about that so you have a conservative market assumption embedded in the fee guide for the coming year and just given that historical experience i was hoping you could just provide additional granularity in terms of growth across the different fee lines thats underpinning that to growth assumption for this year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure let me maybe describe it in a couple ways because to is for the overall franchise we think that there are some areas of the franchise that will be higher and in some cases a good bit higher than that asset management very geared towards the equity markets and the tailwind in equity markets comes through on literally half of that tends to go right through the asset management fee line and then the flows that we talked about earlier in the call provide a nice tailwind so we need to see how markets play through but the combination of those two which is exactly how the business is designed its marketbased and its flowbased will be healthy i think software and data processing weve historically said highsingle digits sometimes lowdouble digits if you look at the last couple years youre at the average full year growth and weve got good visibility there part of that is alpha and part of that is outright software and data sales and so thats strong i think at the other bookend servicing fees will come in itll be a bit below the to now some of that is core organic net new business that we need to drive which is why weve reshaped and tuned that area in particular on the sales and how we go to market youre seeing some of the benefits there and how we measure ourselves were being very conscious there but one of the reasons that one will be lower this coming year is that we had that previously announced transition coming through which will mute some of what wed like to see and then the markets activities were hoping will be somewhere in the middle of the range whether fx trading and sec finance i think what plays out behind the marketdependent areas and sometimes why we dont ph need is around client what we describe as client activity how much transactional activity whether our clients are on the sidelines or whether theyre all in that this past year on the servicing fees which are half of our fees that was worth percentage points to percentage points of servicing fee headwind i mean that literally so you do the math thats worth million million of headwind because we dont have that activity the transactional activity in derivatives in international custody which is very very valuable to us state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 so part of what plays through is the macroeconomic features equity bond markets on one hand youve got a client the kind of risk on risk off sentiment i think is important youve got volatility levels in fx and agency lending and so those we have to live through and navigate through and sometimes those will come in more strongly and sometimes less and then i think finally the piece that we do need to deliver on steve is the part that we can control which is sales its retention and weve been very clear about our goals and our targets very purposely because thats where we think we need to hold ourselves particularly accountable and where you can hold us accountable and theres a version of goals and targets in servicing we spent a little extra time there but if you go through our line of businesses weve got similar kinds of goals areabyarea and thats on us to deliver which will help power us through but the cyclical elements will still come and go steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks eric thats really helpful color just one quick followup from me whats the assumed timing for the large client transition just wanted to get a sense as to whether thats reflected in the servicing fee guide or youre expecting that later in the year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp let me see how let me try to describe this to you in a couple ways and to be helpful at this point on a quarterly run rate basis and i say that very specifically were about halfway through the transition including a piece that came out in the fourth quarter so were halfway through on a quarterly run rate basis we also though have to think about it on a fiscal yearonyear basis and the way i would describe it on a fiscal yearonyear basis remember we said this was worth about percentage points of total fees thats what weve disclosed in our qs and ks about a quarter of that fiscally has come out through the end of about half of it will come out through and about another quarter in so it just takes time to play through and so we did include that headwind in the first quarter versus first quarter guide and it is important to that guide and so our guide includes that and youve got the net guide as a result steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thanks for taking the questions operator your next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch hey good afternoon just a very quick followup i know the call has gone on so long eric i heard you talk about just the right level of deposits between billion and billion did you say that you expect the growth we saw in fourth quarter to reverse in as we think about the deposits shakeout eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 ebrahim its eric no what i said is that we think well operate in the billion to billion range in the first quarter second through the year we expect that to be where we land i think in fourth quarter on average right remember we also i think talked a little bit about the months we talked theres endofperiod data which is very volatile but on average we ended up at i think around billion for the quarter in and so we think roughly flattish deposits into its just hard to tell there is seasonality at yearend there tends to be a low point in february and then youve got cash building for tax purposes into march but id call it flattish in the scheme of things but with a range around that ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch and just a bigger picture question around nib mix and nii do we need to get to a point where qt is short the fed is done with cutting rates before we see nii stabilize and maybe the deposit mix shift or stabilize as well like do we need to get to that point or can it happen sooner than that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp its a fair question my instinct on this is nib will begin to stabilize sometime in by we think sometime in the by the middle of the year third quarter youve kind of at that point weve ill call it burned through the largest accounts those are the ones that kind of on a since its peak are down in nib the smallest accounts are down by about since the peak and those were seeing stabilize more and more so i think well see some stability in nib because clients and funds and fund boards have made their decisions especially the ones that have million or million in an account some of them just dont want to deal with the tax reporting and so youll get to some stabilization so we think that will kind of stabilize i think the broader question on nii will then come with how what well and at that point i think deposit betas kind of tend to stabilize as well so i think at that point in the second half of next sic this year the real question is what is the direction of interest rates on the front end its a very important question which is whats going to whats where is the long end going to go and where is the long end going to go in the us versus in the international markets and that is particularly important to the banking sector because with some amount of steepness in the yield curve and i its hard to remember when weve had steepness its been a while some amount of steepness in the yield curve is quite accretive to nii and you expect in a good economy to have some and so that will be a feature so theres a series of elements that will come through and its hard i think to as a result predict too precisely ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch thats helpful color thanks eric eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from ryan kenny morgan stanley please go ahead state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks for taking the question just a followup on the capital side so you had an cet1 ratio that was a nice improvement sequentially looks like that was driven mostly by billion of lower rwa can you just help us impact the rwa dynamics a bit what drove the optimization and then you also mentioned rwa could be higher this year to support various businesses does that mean that the optimization was just temporary eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure its eric let me describe it in a couple different ways every bank tries to manage rwa just because its part of our capital requirements and returns and we try to report it carefully and we do it fully to the rules as youd expect what tends to create the volatility because its a spot measure its a one day of the quarter one out of 90day measure is the market factors right so if youve got an fx or in any of the trading businesses if youve got a forward book or even a vanilla derivative book youve got counterparty exposures youve got that are affected in particular by the currency pairs and as those move around in the last week of the quarter you might be in the money or out of the money in those positions and those directly because of how to standardize rwa mathematics work just goes right through rwa so that could create a swing of billion billion on the size of our rwas our rwas is about we printed around billion about half of that is in the markets area and so theres a good bit of variability and thats literally what happens and so sometimes well end up low sometimes well end up high if you look at page of the presentation material youll see a low point of billion a year ago in rwa youll see a higher point of billion last quarter and quite a bit of that is driven by just those market factors playing through into the calculations that we have and then in addition to that if youre on a loan book like we do youll have overdrafts overdrafts take rwa as well and so we also saw some amount of benefit there this quarter i think the way i would describe the goforward view is that we ended up particularly low this quarter we said by could be billion billion lower than expected what would par be maybe ill describe it that way going forward it might be billion it might be billion but youve got to put a plus billion minus billion band around that and so what we want to do is we want to gently continue to reinvest capital into our businesses because these fx businesses now that we have good returns weve managed them well theyve got returns in many cases the securities finance businesses typically are highsingle digit return businesses but thats healthy and its very connected to the servicing and the administrative fee business that we have and important to our clients and so our view is that these are ways for us to solidify and expand and deepen our relationship with clients and so well gently add rwa each year how much do we add we add a few billion dollars billion to billion of more rwa each year perhaps but therell be some volatility around that and that will be a part of the way we drive our organic growth were a highreturn bank thats for sure but we do want to put some of our capital to work for core organic growth reasons ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great appreciate all those details thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 operator your next question comes from mike brown with kbw please go ahead michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you for taking the questions i guess i noticed that you saw record cash net inflows in and you mentioned that you actually took share in the institutional money market space as we head into a declining rate environment here i guess whats your expectation about how these cash and money fund assets could trend from here i guess historically institutional money markets they can act quite differently than retail so i guess once the fed begins to reduce rates here what are you thinking about in terms of the path of the flows out of money funds could you actually still see some money fund inflows from institutional investors ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yeah mike its a good question and one we think about all the time so part of way weve attracted more money market funds going back to one of my prior answers is we just have a broader client base and that helps weve gained market share not just in terms of assets but weve just attracted more clients and once you have them whether the balances go up or down typically you have them i think historically whats happened in terms and youve got to look back in history now because we havent had this kind of a marketplace but the really sophisticated holders of institutional money market funds tend to hang on right because the fund itself depending on its duration and there is a little bit of duration in it actually lags so its usually the opposite when you when rates are rising the very sophisticated holders are toggling in and out depending on whether they see opportunities to go direct just given the nature of our client base we dont see a lot of that activity so we expect to keep them and it really will be around where do their balances go and do they need it for some other reason or do they see more attractive investment opportunities i would expect that we would see if indeed we see a continued risk on environment that itself will cause a little bit of reallocation out of institutional money market funds because saying that everybody what everybody is talking about that theres so much parked on the sidelines well a lot of it is parked here but i would go back to where i began the answer which is it really is about establishing more client relationships servicing them very well and then continue to grow the number of clients based on that track record michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks ron the billion share buyback authorization that certainly was a big number eric as you just alluded to in the last question theres a lot of puts and takes to consider on the capital front in and into i guess my question is really just why come with such a large authorization youre targeting payout ratio so this would seem to me that you certainly would not need all of that in is this just a desire to have kind of a big authorization in place for a multiyear horizon or just to have more flexibility over time just would love to hear a little bit more about that thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 mike its eric the background here is that the industry has evolved i would say preccar which is a long time ago there used to be openended authorizations in the banking sector once we got into ccar remember there was a very defined annual amount of buybacks that you had to submit in fact you had to submit the first year and the second year and there was a lot of making sure that what you submitted within the fed ccar process was actually what you did because wanted to keep consistency with that and so the industry moved towards quite a bit of disclosure on a oneyear basis as a result and if you recall a lot of those oneyear disclosures happened right after ccar was announced either at the end of june or in the second quarter earnings in july what weve seen as weve scanned at least the banking our peer banks the gsibs the large us regionals is now that ccar is its still an annual process but its really with the scb and some of the refinements to it its really an ongoing process and what weve realized is that id say more than threequarters of our peers you probably know have actually moved to openended programs over the last year yearandahalf and so we just wanted to conform to that as a result this ones multiyear its openended and well take it from there michael c brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great thanks for all the color there eric thank you operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well no good deed goes unpunished billion buyback to that last question but are you assuming that basel iii gets modified and if basel iii didnt exist how much higher would that billion number be and at what price do you say buybacks dont make so much sense anymore ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp mike maybe ill start on the basel iii i think its where basel iii comes out is very uncertain at this point the comment period ended january i dont know how many millions of pages were submitted but theres a lot to be evaluated there and you all know the various pressure and response that the regulators are getting on this so its very hard to tell i dont know that we would have changed the authorization if we had perfect clarity on where it was coming out it was a factor but its not like we have a we think its absolutely going to be this and therefore so i hope that helps eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah and i might mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well maybe just ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 go ahead mike go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc no just so where your base case what is the rwa inflation the most recent updates weve gotten a few changes here during earnings season due to basel iii eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah mike let me describe it this way the headline that weve previously disclosed for the anpr as its written is basel rwa increased for us at about so thats what weve shared i think what we said at the time and we actually believe even more so now is that it will come in at a portion of that theres been lots of discussion around for example energy tax credits some of the arcane parts of basel and how that impacts public policy mortgages which were not really affected on theres much more discussion about operational risk literally over the last few months and that would make us quite optimistic that the increases would be relatively small so weve not updated it because its just youve got to theres a menu out there but were encouraged we think the regulators are trying to navigate public policy on one hand and the right level of capital in the banking system but we think the direction of the discussions in particular over the last few months are constructive mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much for taking my questions most of my questions have been asked and answered can you hear me ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yes brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks most of my questions have been answered just one quick one on securities portfolio repositioning i guess eric whats the desire to potentially do more of those and potentially take losses and look at the sort of the capital usage for doing that and enhancing nii and nim more versus share buybacks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brian its eric its something that we continue to think about i think every bank continues to think about we included were just continuing to just work through how do we feel about the rate levels that were at in particular state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 on the up on the curve we are conscious of that both in the us and in the international areas weve got positions in pound sterling and euros and so forth so well just continue to evaluate it i think as you indicated from your question part of the reason we repositioned last year in the third quarter was around rate position we thought it was a very good entry point in retrospect we timed that quite well so we were quite pleased and i think we felt like we came out ahead economically with the trade because remember we took out some bonds but also reinvested both in the belly of the curve and overnight so that was constructive and well also keep an eye on we dont have a lot of capitalintensive securities weve always had a very vanilla book so theres not an enormous capital motivation but well selectively look at it and see if it might make sense but i think were like many others its one of the things we keep an eye on brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks very much operator your next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp hi guys wanted to ask about the fee operating leverage target for this year hypothetically lets say fees come in better than you expect would you anticipate dropping that down to the bottom line or reinvesting it maybe the same question in reverse fees come in lower than expected what kind of room is there on the expense side to preserve your fee operating leverage target ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yeah rob why dont i start on that we feel like weve done a very good job in focusing on bau cost reduction to help finance and create a very sizable investment pool eric walked you through that so obviously if fees are up dramatically more than expected there are some revenuerelated expenses but i wouldnt foresee i think weve got a lot to invest and execute against and i really want to get through that on the margin there might be a few things that we would do but the vast majority of it would go to the bottom line on the in the case of the if the opposite occurs whatever a terrible market geopolitical issues flare and youve just got a very different environment than any one of us anticipate again wed probably youd see some revenuerelated expenses come down naturally which would help i think at least my initial instinct would be to try and preserve the investments and look at is there any more to do on bau but then obviously some of these we would weve got a pecking order for our investments in terms of priorities and if it came to that wed defer them eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and rob its eric i would just add that weve got a pretty industrious productivity plan for this year part of that was the repositioning that we announced but twothirds of the roles impacted are really around delayering and simplifying state street were actually taking our spans of control in some areas like operations from to were taking standard controls in the business and staff functions in some cases from to right and the state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 benefit of that is it actually brings our client teams and operational teams even closer to our clients right and some of what were doing with the joint venture consolidation is a catalyst for that because in some cases we had too many handoffs and now we can simplify processes and again bring them closer to our clients so theres some real structural changes there and what we do want to do is make sure we see those through as ron mentioned theres always a little more well look at on the margin but we want to be careful we want to do this right but on the margin you continue to work on vendors and so forth you look at performancebased incentive compensation there are always other smaller levers but were pretty i think weve got a nice work set out and a lot to do and i think weve got real confidence that this is i think year probably five i dont think we name our programs with annual versions but this is probably year five of productivity program and should really deliver quite a bit robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks and then on the regulatory front there was some commentary last week from the fdic around regulations for large index fund providers im curious if you have any thoughts there and how that can potentially impact your business ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp from the fdic yeah i didnt see this rob curious as to the fdics role in index funds i wonder what vanguard has to say about that so im just not familiar with it rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay i can send it over to you later eric w aboaf a vice
