management discussion section noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning in london its great to see everybody in the room with us today thank you for coming and good afternoon to everyone watching and listening in hong kong and elsewhere ewen will take you through our q4 numbers very shortly but id like to begin with a summary of how we delivered against our strategic plan in as you know we refreshed our core purpose as an organization a year ago opening up a world of opportunity draws heavily on hsbcs past but it also encapsulates what we need to focus on to succeed now and in the future by keeping our purpose and the values that underpin it firmly in mind we delivered good progress against our four strategic pillars focus on our strengths digitize at scale energize for growth and transition to net zero and this has contributed to a strong financial performance which was supported by the global economic recovery starting now with a few highlights im pleased with the progress weve made on both our transformation and growth agendas and i want to pay tribute to the whole hsbc team for the job theyve done in the underlying growth in key revenue streams came through strongly in q4 to offset the drag effect of declining rates resulting in a reported revenue growth of in the quarter coupled with tailwinds from higher interest rates this provides strong revenue momentum for the future were also well on our way through a number of announced exits and acquisitions that materially alter our capital allocation to areas where we have a distinctive competitive advantage reported profits before tax for the full year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 were up to billion all regions were profitable asia led the way with billion of reported profits including billion from india up million on the year there was also strong contributions of billion of adjusted profits from our nonringfenced bank operations in the uk and europe and million of adjusted profits from the us business i was also pleased there was strong fee income growth across all businesses with overall which overall was above precovid levels plus international accounts opening in commercial banking was up and trade balances were up overall and today stand higher than precovid levels we increased spending on technology and performancerelated pay but im pleased we kept costs stable able to do so due to the savings from our transformation programs which are ahead of plan if rates follow the path currently implied by the market we now expect to reach at least rote in thats a year earlier than we had previously signaled we took a charge on expected credit losses in q4 primarily due to change in market conditions in the mainland china commercial real estate sector ewen will go into this in more detail but im pleased to say we have seen some positive movements in market sentiments since the yearend finally weve announced fullyear dividends of per share up as well as our intention to initiate an incremental share buyback of up to billion on top of the existing buyback of up to billion announced earlier in the year this slide sets out how this translates into progress against our ambitions it shows good progress in key areas revenue growth for the year as a whole was impacted by the low interest rate environment particularly in asia where we experienced lower hibor rates in but we turned the corner in q4 as net interest income grew yearonyear for the first time since the pandemic began and all our global businesses grew fee income in by highsingledigits costs were down slightly yearonyear and we expect adjusted costs to be stable on that position rote was our capital ratio remained strong at and we expect to move into our cet1 target range of to in and weve made over billion of rwa saves across the group over the last two years against our original threeyear target of billion given this progress we now expect to achieve billion of cumulative rwa saves by the end of this year the next slides go through key metrics on our four strategic pillars the first pillar is focused on our strengths which is about capitalizing on the unique advantages we have as an institution wealth and personal banking is one of those areas particularly in asia our investment in people technology and capabilities yielded strong returns we had a strong year in net new invested assets especially in asia greatly helped by a strong flow of referrals from our wholesale banking clients this is an inherent strategic advantage that we are investing in overall wealth balances grew to trillion and within that funds under management increased by supported by more than new asset management products in asia asia wealth revenue also grew by mainly due to the improvement in equity markets and customer sentiment while we also saw strong mortgage growth in hong kong and the uk finally on this slide i was pleased that the value of new insurance business in asia in q4 was higher than the same period in both and this is the cumulative effect of a significant investment program and turnaround in that business over the last three to four years it is also particularly encouraging given the border between hong kong and mainland china remains closed hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 slide focuses on wholesale banking we saw strong fee income growth across our wholesale franchises even as we exited clients and shrunk our capital base in global banking and markets this offset lower trading income when compared to the exceptionally strong performance we saw in international connectivity remains key to our strategy as i said earlier trade balances were up overall and above precovid levels glcm balances were up billion or yearonyear to over billion and collaboration revenues were also up with referrals between commercial banking and global banking and markets up ive been pleased with the way that global banking and markets has performed for the past two years even while weve been repositioning that business adjusted rwas were down as we continue to transfer resources mainly from europe into asia and the middle east slide shows how weve exited nonstrategic businesses in the west while accelerating customer acquisition in the east im pleased by the progress weve made in transforming the us and continental europe business but also by their good profit performance in the transactions for the sale of the us retail business have closed on schedule in the last two weeks meanwhile we expect to close the sale of our french retail business in the second half of we also accelerated the development of our asia wealth capabilities through the acquisition of axa singapore which was completed earlier this month on schedule the acquisition of lt investment management in india which we hope to complete towards the end of this year and regulatory approval to take full ownership of our hsbc life joint venture in china all on top of the organic buildout of our pinnacle business in mainland china which continues ahead of schedule slide looks at our second pillar digitize at scale which is about making it easier for our customers to bank with us and making our processes more efficient weve continued to invest heavily in technology while managing costs spending around billion in which is equivalent to around of our adjusted operating expenses which was up percentage point on the prior year our ambition is to keep the increasing technology spending to more than of our operating expenses by this investment provides us with significant operating leverage as we grow the business in the future it is also enabling us to deploy solutions at scale globally and to further leverage agile work here and cloud technology while our usage of both agile and cloud increased in we have ambitions to drive further growth in the years to come digital penetration levels have also increased with today of trade transactions globally initiated through digital channels a increase in the share of digital payments made through hsbcnet mobile app by wholesale customers and of retail customers are now mobile active although this figure was up percentage points on the prior year i still see a significant opportunity to grow it much further our third strategic pillar is about creating a dynamic inclusive culture where people want to work and they feel empowered in our most recent staff survey our employee engagement score was unchanged on more encouragingly percentage points up on and percentage points above the financial services benchmark were aiming to build a more diverse business we were pleased to exceed our target of of women in leadership roles globally in and we set ourselves a new target of by weve also made progress on ethnicity representation especially for black colleagues but we still have a way to go to get to where we want to be and need to be on both of these measures and were helping our colleagues to develop futureready skills over colleagues use the new degreed learning platform last year with the average time spent on training for fulltime employee up despite the pressures of covid an increasing share of this time was spent on areas like digital data and sustainability all of hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 which are essential for our future i also want to add that another important part of our culture is that we remain costconscious i am absolutely determined we wont go back to the days when the rise in the interest rates loosened our grip on costs slide looks at the transition plan to net zero our fourth pillar our ambition is to provide and facilitate between billion and trillion of sustainable financing and investment by i truly believe this will enable us to play a leading role in the transition and weve made a very strong start since the beginning of weve provided and facilitated billion of sustainable financing and investment to our clients we are committed to working with our clients to develop valid sciencebased transition plans to understand sector by sector client by client how we move to net zero by these transition plans and the targets within them must be predicated on the science relevant to the individual sectors we will use them as a basis for further engagement and decision making including how we drive change within our portfolio constructs as a part of this process we have today disclosed interim targets for onbalance sheet financed emissions in the oil and gas and power and utility sectors in the year ahead we plan to set interim targets for financed emissions across a range of other sectors and we will work on our climate transition plan which will be published in and will bring together in one place how we embed our net zero targets into our strategy our processes our policies and our governance informed by bottomup transition plans im pleased by the progress weve made reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations our combination of less travel and sustainable energy deals enable us to halve our scope and scope emissions compared to as the world normalizes we have to be clear that we do not expect our route to net zero to be linear but we do believe that many of these changes are embedded for future years overall theres more to do but im pleased with the progress weve made so far ill now hand over to ewen for the q4 numbers ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel good morning or afternoon all and echo noel great to see so many of you in the room today with us we had another good quarter of reported pretax profits of billion up on last years fourth quarter adjusted revenues were modestly up on last years fourth quarter this reinforces what i said at the third quarter we think were now past the trough in revenues ecls were million net charge in the quarter operating expenses were down million on last years fourth quarter due to a lower bank levy and continuing good cost discipline our return on tangible equity for was our core tier ratio remained strong at tangible net asset value per share of was up on the third quarter weve announced fullyear dividends of per share thats up on the prior year we also intend to initiate an incremental buyback of up to billion this will begin after the buyback of up to billion is concluded in april turning to slide as i headline were pleased with the lending and fee income growth that were now seeing lending balances were up overall on the third quarter underlying this was growth for our personal and commercial banking businesses combined equivalent to billion in total which was partially offset by planned reductions in global banking and markets hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 there was strong lending growth in wealth and personal banking up billion or on the fourth quarter of last year reflecting another strong mortgage performance in the uk and hong kong lending was up billion in commercial banking mainly in trade and term lending in asia fee income increased by versus the fourth quarter of within this commercial banking increased fee income by reflecting both good volume growth and repositioning in some areas towards fee income on the next slide despite the impact of lower rates weve been seeing a recovery in revenues for the commercial banking for a few quarters now and has continued in the fourth quarter global banking and markets had another good quarter driven primarily by good performance in fx and capital markets and advisory and we saw our first quarter of yearonyear revenue growth in personal banking since the onset of covid19 and in wealth strong new business growth was offset by adverse insurance market impacts tonight for the current quarter we expect some weakness in our asian wealth revenues as highlighted previously our revenues will be impacted by the adoption of ifrs in we continue to expect an initial downward adjustment to our insurance profits of around twothirds as we said at the third quarter we are planning for an around billion adjustment to our insurances tangible equity and we intend to provide further detail on ifrs in the third quarter of this year on slide net interest income was billion up against the third quarter on a reported basis this was mainly driven by higher yields on customer loans as well as underlying asset growth on rates the net interest margin was basis points unchanged on the third quarter with higher asset yields offset by changes in the asset mix based on the current interest rate expectations for we expect net interest income to now grow materially with further material growth in we think weve given you the building blocks to model this including modeling the sensitivity as rate curve shift turning to slide and recognizing the higher gearing we have to a better rate environment i wanted to say a few words and i disclosed interest rate sensitivity analysis as a reminder our high interest rate sensitivity is driven by our balance sheet structure namely a deposit surplus of around billion and the short tenure of our lending portfolios and trade franchise for illustration purposes our tables now assume a simplified passthrough rate for all interestbearing deposits in reality for the first few rate rises we assume well see a lower passthrough rate rising towards or above of rates continue to rise on the next slide we reported a net charge of million of ecls in the quarter this included stage charges primarily relating to commercial real estate in mainland china a substantial part of which is booked in hong kong as noel says there has been some positive sentiment since the yearend we expect this to begin to help ease the current tight liquidity for the sector stage charges remained low and the quarter also included covid19 related releases were continuing to hold around million of covid19 uplift to stage and ecl reserves equivalent to about of the initial reserve the overall quality of our loan book remains good stage loans as a percentage of total loans are stable at around we expect ecls to normalize towards basis points of average loans in with upside from potential covid19 releases in the first half of and potential risk from continued uncertainty in mainland china commercial real estate hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 turning to slide the fourth quarter adjusted operating costs excluding the bank levy were modestly down on the same period last year costs were broadly stable on as per our third quarter guidance the fourth quarter performance was driven by continued good cost control together with a lower performancerelated pay accrual in the quarter relative to the fourth quarter last year the bank levy came in at million this was lower than expected due to an offset in credit for bank levy fees paid in prior years we expect the bank levy to normalize at around million per year from this year onwards we made a further million of cost program savings during the fourth quarter with an associated cost to achieve of around million turning to the next slide in the first two years of our threeyear cost program weve achieved savings of billion with cumulative cost to achieve spend todate of billion we now expect to exceed our overall target of billion to billion of cost savings with at least a further billion of cost savings in and at least a further million of savings in we expect to fully utilize our billion cost to achieve budget by the end of so please model a final cost to achieve spend of billion this year despite inflationary pressures noel and i are committed to continuing to deliver tight cost control for we aim to keep adjusted costs again broadly stable and in we intend to manage adjusted cost growth to be within a to range a few things to note for costs and beyond firstly on recent ma activity we expect the net impact to be broadly neutral on costs in and modestly positive in following the completion of the sale of our french retail bank in the second half of secondly there will be a reduction in operating cost as a result of the shift to ifrs but also an associated reduction in revenues and thirdly from onwards we intend to move away from reported adjusted numbers with any further restructuring costs absorbed above the line and any large distorting items disclosed under notable items turning to capital on slide our core tier ratio was down basis points on the third quarter reported riskweighted assets were down billion on the third quarter riskweighted asset saves and improving asset quality offsetting riskweighted asset growth from lending and regulatory change our cumulative riskweighted asset saves are now billion against the threeyear target of billion by the end of given this progress we now have an ambition to achieve billion of cumulative riskweighted asset saves by this year end on the next slide were expecting to be within our core tier ratio of to during this year as shown on this table we expect around basis points of total impact during from notable items including regulatory change and ma a large part of which will be in the first quarter it will also include the planned sale of our french retail bank in the third quarter once within our to range we intend to actively manage to be within this range but please recognize that due to normal capital volatility you could see us above or below this range in some quarters in addition and in line with pra regulatory guidance the dividend will accrue at of reported profits for each quarter of this is not a signal of future dividend intentions and finally for clarity on our two buyback programs the billion buyback program that is currently underway has to complete by 20th of april under its sixmonth regulatory authorization post the agm in late april we intend to then launch the billion buyback program that we announced today hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 so to conclude in the context of a continued challenged macro environment these were a good set of fourth quarter and fullyear results heading into this year with strong core momentum underpinned by increasingly robust growth and continued tight cost discipline if the current rates outlook is maintained were on track to deliver a return on tangible equity of at least in thats a year earlier than our expectations at the third quarter and finally and importantly healthy capital distributions have now been restored with that martin can we please open up for questions in the room and on the line and richard is coming up to host the qa thank you question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions the first three questions will be taken in the room so i will now hand over to mr richard oconnor richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah good morning everybody ill take the first three from the room as the operator said if you just give your name and institution please over to raul in the front row to start with would you wait for the mics please raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan chase hi good morning its raul sinha from jpmorgan thanks for doing this in person a couple of questions from me to start firstly on nim ewen i was wondering if you could unpack the moving parts across the big parts of the franchise so if you look at hbap nim its broadly stable if you look at the uk nim its down quarteronquarter what is driving the sort of weakness in the uk nim and how do you think mortgage pricing will impact that going forward i think we can do our numbers on hbap nim going forwards and then the second question is just coming back to the cost discussion perhaps more for noel i was quite interested in your comments about the historical slippage in costs when rates have gone up with hsbc and i guess one of the things that is different this time is inflation is obviously moving up so i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how youre managing inflation what are you seeing in terms of inflation across the bank and how youre managing that over the medium term within your cost plans thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc do you want to go first ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look on nim and im sure therell be a few questions on nim in terms of what were seeing look in the uk i think what youre predominantly seeing is the sort of mix shift towards mortgages at the moment impacting nim together with continued very healthy liquidity levels we do think over time what well see is a recovery in some of the other loan books particularly unsecured so you should begin to see both an improving shift in the asset mix together with significant benefits coming through from rate rises as you can see in our interest rate sensitivity tables sterling is our most sensitive currency hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 yeah in hong kong i dont think theres anything particular to sort of call out in terms of asset mix again i think the main thing the main sort of debate i think in hong kong looking out is obviously hong kong dollar is pegged to us dollars just how quickly if we are seeing and when we do see a rising us rate environment how quickly that will translate into a rising hibor i think if you go back over time typically theres been about a threemonth lag period i think given omicron at the moment that may elongate it out a bit but we would certainly think in the coming months well start to see a very material recovery in hibor coming as well on costs noel do you want to noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on costs weve managed to contain the costs slightly down in relative to why because frankly we took out billion of transformation costs in the first two years of the transformation program that has allowed us to fund increased investment in tech its allowed us to fund an increase in the variable pay pool relative to of and if you look at the vp pool its up on its up on so our vp pool in still inflated over but we managed to keep the cost flat now ewen said were also planning a further billion of cost takeout this year as part of that transformation program and another billion the year after and that we believe gives us the cushion necessary to recycle that cost transformation into investment in tech and into investment in people whilst keeping the overall cost base flat for and within the range of to thereafter in and weve got good line of sights on that cost takeout so i think its manageable and achievable what we really want is the revenue momentum we have on an underlying level complemented by the interest rate curve thats coming our way to actually flow through into returns not to flow through into cost and were determined to try and enhance the returns of the business which is why were pulling forward the return target by a year at but we want to go beyond that and i dont want the cost to take away from that achievement ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean so the other thing that weve had during covid is obviously the benefit on certain activity thats just fundamentally changed as a result of covid so yeah if you go back two years we were spending million on travel and entertainment that was less than million last year we expect it to recover but weve said were not going to allow our travel costs to return ph to see its capped at of what it was pre covid weve announced that were going to get out of of our nonbranch based commercial real estate weve done about half of that so far but again i think covid and the fact that we are going to adopt hybrid working on a permanent basis opens up a significant opportunity im now hot desking and i know that our cro has gone and stolen a whole bunch of printers out of the building to make it harder for us to print but for those of you who hot desk you certainly dont want any paper at the end of the day because then you have to store it so i think yeah and then youve got this big shift in digital engagement from our customer base thats gone on through covid particularly in some cohorts of the customer base like the elderly who previously were not that digitally engaged and again i think that will open up further cost opportunities for us and at some of those cost opportunities i think that have helped offset the inflationary pressure that we wouldnt have seen previously hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc let me give you an example on that if we can just richard if youd allow me richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc trade transformation we embarked upon a digitization program of our trade platform with the biggest trade bank in the world as you know we fundamentally replatform that business over the past four years on some modern technology consequence of that trade revenue for the full year last year was up trade balance is up over if you look at q4 on q4 trade revenue was up around about so theres momentum in the trade in the revenue but what its also done is it increased our nps scores we now got a positive nps in trade of we didnt have that four years ago if you also look at what its done for costs weve got a reduction in our baseline head count that existed in when we started that program so if you look at it from whatever angle facilitating revenue growth because were more competitive we got new product capability better customer service as evidenced in the nps and a lower cost to serve as evidenced in the head count in trade thats why we put in more money into the digitization agenda and thats the impact it can have on the business and i think thats why we can recycle some of those cost savings into inflation meeting inflation needs of the remaining employee base richard richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah joe next and then omar afterwards okay joe in the middle there you go joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi thanks its joe dickerson from jefferies just a quick question on the buyback so is this something you want to make a recurring feature of your capital return because if rates do what you think theyll do to get to your return on tangible equity youll generate a lot of capital so is this something that you want to do on a quarterly basis billion a quarter or whats the thought process around creating some regular cadence to buybacks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so well to sort of broaden the question out i think joe i mean yeah our primary tool of distributions is dividends and weve sort of been clear that were going to pay within a to payout ratio this year we were right at the very bottom end of that range at a payout ratio i think that reflected yeah our view on the sustainability of particularly the ecl line where we had significant writebacks this year and so i think going hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 forward you should expect certainly for our expectation is that well be higher up on that payout range than last year in terms of buybacks we pointed out today that if you were to sort of effectively if you want normalize our core tier today for items that we know that are coming such as regulatory change and ma the is probably closer to today for that basis points of adjustments we pointed out yeah so we do yeah and then youve got for this year i think yeah the natural growth in the business where we said were targeting midsingledigit loan growth weve pointed out that we still think weve got billion or more to do with rwa saves weve got the dividend weve got the incremental billion buyback that we announced today we do still expect there to be some inorganic activity yeah they will be similar to what weve done small bolton deals i think consensus for this year is sitting about billion of buybacks i think were reasonably comfortable with that consensus at the moment but we do intend overall to actively manage our capital base as we said but for this year i think were sort of comfortable with where consensus currently sit but you shouldnt view this buyback program as some sort of in perpetuity buyback program well use it to manage surplus capital joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc omar and then tom afterwards okay omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning omar keenan at credit suisse thank you for the presentation today ive got two questions please so one on rate sensitivity and then just a second one on the outlook for acquisitions and divestments so firstly on rate sensitivity thank you for the disclosure on the deposit beta i was wondering if you could help us with how much discretion hsbc has over its deposit pricing in places like hong kong i guess with the idea being that the surplus deposit position is quite good and the benefit for rate hikes might be much more than the guidance implies earlier on than later on and then secondly on the outlook for acquisitions and divestments so youve completed the three bolton acquisitions that you said you would do and youve also completed or at least signed the exit from the french and us retail business could you comment on how the footprint now looks like and i guess just bearing in mind that theres a bit of movement in mexico with what citigroup is doing and whether theres more potential for bolt ons whether we could see more inorganic activity at hsbc thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to take rate first ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 yeah look on rate sensitivity i think as we said we would certainly assume that for the first few rate rises the deposit beta is going to be less than i mean its a matter of public record what our intentions are in the uk weve announced a series of deposit increases as of the 1st of march they would imply a deposit beta well below for the rate rises that weve seen hong kong we are the market leader in the market so we would expect there to be some increase in deposit rates but again i think for the first or so of rate rises the deposit betas we would expect to be well below yeah so just to explain that we did change the table for this quarter previously we had a sort of average deposit beta but it varied by market so what you see for example is that hong kong sensitivity has come down in that table relative to q3 the reason for that is because we have effectively increased the deposit beta up to we just thought that was easier for you because it gave a consistent basis for you to then make your own assumptions noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc just one other point to know and im sure youve got it in your analysis and that is and i was talking to somebody earlier about my liking of cash and that its positive particularly when you bring it in via operating accounts and a lot of the cash deposits we bring in is not paid for deposits through savings accounts its operating accounts through glcm through personal banking through wealth management and therefore what were able to see is a higher ability to hold on to interest rate rises because we are so focused on bringing in operating accounts indiscernible for in deposits and thats particularly true in our asia franchise where weve drawn in a lot of balances via glcm business ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc ph its going to be like cash in a digital sense noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah omar theres one attribute ive carried with me for years from willie purves which is get the cash inflows and then lend it so oldfashioned richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc the question on ma do you want to noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ma yeah ill take that listen were pleased with the progress weve made on that were pleased with the disposal decisions on the us and on france i think michael has done an excellent job and his team in the us on executing on time on schedule and driving out the costs as a consequence of that really congratulate him on that were on track for completing a more complex disposal program on the french retail business hence it will complete in but we knew that to be the case the plans are progressing well on that on the boltons going well were still looking were observing other opportunities in the market particularly in asia particularly associated with wealth and for wealth indiscernible insurance asset management and broader wealth management capability as and when any of those become a reality if they do become a hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 reality well let you know at that point in time but we still have to look in our opportunities on the acquisition side there stress its bolton and to maybe turn to your specific question on mexico no were not looking to acquire in mexico we have a good business in mexico it produced returns on tangible equity last year of around about i think within that the wealth business and retail business in mexico has higher inherent returns weve got an organic growth model there wed previously guided the market and all of you that our ma activity would be primarily focused on asia and on wealth excuse me for all those online who just heard me sneeze very sorry about that and its not covid honestly so i think weve got a very clear focus on where we want the boltons to be focused on thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc tom and then ill take one from the line tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes sir thank you very much its tom rayner from numis could i just have two please just sticking with the rate sensitivity initially the thing im most interested in is how quickly will the sensitivity sort of fade away once you go beyond basis points move because i guess youre going to see passthrough rates increasing as rates rise also i imagine therell be some asset spread issues such as in the hong kong mortgage market with sort of caps versus prime etcetera so i just wonder if you could give us a bit more color on how things look when you go beyond the basis points and i have a second question on costs and if you want it now or the guidance to from im just wondering whats going to sort of determine where about you land in that range whether youre running a sort of jaws target if you like so if revenue is stronger youll be at the upper end and if revenue disappoints youll be looking to hold it down at the bottom is that youre thinking there thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so on rate sensitivity above basis points thats not a question we often get asked but were pleased were getting asked i mean if you look i mean i guess going back to where we were in the nim at the time was basis points it fell to basis points last year we lost i thought about million of net interest income to book the average interest earning assets bigger than where it was back in so youre right in some markets like hong kong there is this relationship with the prime rate which does start to factor heavily in once rates rise by more than basis points so if i were you i would look at the trajectory of what happened from sort of through and then its not quite analogous because sterling rates are going to be much higher this time but try and draw some comparisons from there as you do your modeling on costs were certainly not targeting a jaws number its hard to target jaws when youve got rising interest rates and you dont want the benefit of those rising interest rates to get reflected into rising costs so i think it just highlights a decent degree of uncertainty is where we are on inflation yeah when you go out into weve got the impact of ma that weve highlighted therell also be that oneoff from ifrs which will take cost down thats not on that guidance but you do have to model that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 we know that weve got at least billion of cost savings coming through from the cost programs that were running we are going to have to were getting rid of the cost to achieve program in so its definitely finishing at the end of this year so any restructuring costs will be absorbed above the line i would say in addition to that cost guidance because were comparing sort of what we call adjusted to adjusted typically at the moment were having about billion of other costs that would be in sig items being sort of large litigation costs and when we sell businesses and stuff the losses on sale of that so in addition to that adjusted cost guidance typically theres about billion or so of other items which will be on top of that noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc tom its a good question but just to put it into context tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc so its hard to predict how inflation will move forward over the next year or two but theres likely to be inflation there somewhere between no cost increases on a likeforlike basis and million is the relative to if you roll the clock back and you rolled in the interest rates effect that we lost billion so the to is relatively insensitive whether its or relative to what could be billion or billion of incremental revenue by that time and i think what were trying to signal very clearly is were not looking to have an explosion in costs just because interest rates are going to come through and to contain it in the to range is a reasonably flat cost base relative to what could be happening on revenue ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean if you look at consensus that has existed a couple of weeks ago yeah there was about a billion increase or increase in revenues from through and were saying were going to keep cost growth to over that period and i think consensus as it was a couple of weeks ago is understated because it hasnt fully reflected the impact of rate rises noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc so the rate rises in that consensus a few weeks ago is inconsistent with todays curve ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so if you just take those numbers youve got very very material jaws coming through tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay well open the lines to hopefully jason napier of ubs jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch good morning thank you for taking my questions the first one is around that revenue growth number that noel you just shared if i just focus on net interest income your annualized in the fourth quarter of billion loan growth gets you to billion and half the rate gearing that youve given today on a beta thats too high wed see nii over billion in and the same math would get you at minimum billion or billion in ewen in the past youve helped us with sort of blunt expectations around nii im sure you dont want the market to get too carried away but it appears to me that on the simple loan growth and rate gearing numbers you provided the consensus should be substantially higher billion or billion for this year and maybe billion for next year thats the first one the second question is around the shape of the group from a capital perspective most of the rwa savings work has been done and yet the tnav share of asia is roughly stable at about of the group and i just wondered whether the restructuring of balance sheets and the moving of capital around the group shouldnt lead to faster rwa growth in the years ahead or was it really more about taking capital out of low return destinations so should we be expecting faster growth out of asia now that those capital has been freed up from its ph past uses thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ill take the second question do you wanted to take the first ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah you know i hate forecasting net interest income and nim but anyway ill do my best to talk about it i did think jason we think and i dont know why in your math but you are a bit ph toppy on yeah we think that consensus which was at we had a yeah we think consensus for which we had a billion was understated but not by the magnitude that youre talking about and the consensus that was published the average consensus were billion for we think that is more meaningfully understated and i dont know whether jason how you factored in things like the continued rwa rundown program because if you look at whats basically implied with our riskweighted asset growth this year yeah if were talking about midsingle digits were saying of that is coming from regulatory change so theres a sort of net call it percentage points of net increase which is underlying loan growth yet less the rwas were running off but so modestly understated for more materially understated for noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc on your second point the share of the group id probably draw your attention to two slides in the deck the slide and slide slide is a new piece of information i dont think weve previously disclosed but what it shows hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 for wholesale banking is the interconnectivity of the group so if you look at the percentage of client revenue in wholesale banking that has an international connectivity those clients bank with us in multiple geographies that percentage is now what you see in the report and accounts is where we book it in the legal entity so you see legal entity booking in asia and youll see legal entity booking in europe and the us but so much of what we book in europe and the us is connected to our business in asia and the middle east and what we try to give you in that is in wholesale banking terms essentially of our revenue from clients in wholesale banking has some form of crossborder connectivity but youll see that revenue booked in multiple legal entities so i think your analysis on how much capital is asiarelated relative to nonasia is a bit distorted when you look at a legal entity basis and if you then go to slide what you will see from gbm is of the revenue booked in the east on our legal entity balance sheets in the east emerges from western clients so of greg and georges revenue essentially gets booked in the east but originates from clients we bank in europe the uk the us in the west and that again if you look at it purely on a legal entity basis youll see european and us balance sheets and say why are they so capitalheavy its because theyre a feeder of business into our operations in asia and the middle east ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah jason i think in addition to what noels just went through i mean if you go back to what we announced a couple of years ago about this 100odd billion of rwa reduction in the west and redeployment in the east what weve seen over the last couple of years i think is a very successful execution of the first part of that ie that were now in excess of what we started out with but the redeployment in the east has been slowed down as a result of covid so we do think that that redeployment rate will now pick up as the asian economies progressively come out of covid richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc well take another question from the line of hopefully ben toms from rbc over to you ben benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd good morning and thank you both for taking my questions two please firstly your flow mortgage market share in the uk picked up significantly in q4 do you intend to keep being aggressive in terms of pricing and growth in the uk and then secondly you took a topup provisions for chinese commercial real estate in the quarter can you just give us some flavor on what youre seeing on the ground in respect to the chinese cre and is it still the indirect exposure there that keeps you awake at night thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to take the mortgage market ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 yeah so on yeah our flow market share in the quarter i think was our stock share is i think as you all know we still feel structurally underweight in uk mortgages our share of current accounts by value i think has ticked up to just under now so we still feel structurally underweight mortgages i dont think wed describe our pricing as aggressive we dont necessarily aspire to be in the top three of the best buy tables but we do think we can continue to take market share above our stock share i think a notable feature of what we saw in the market which youll all be familiar with is this was the first quarter for quite a while i think where our front book margins were below back book margins and have continued to drop a bit in q1 as well yeah weve also seen a significant increase in riskweighted assets for uk mortgages from the beginning of this year we still think were earning returns comfortably above the cost of capital at this point but yeah conditions are competitive at the moment in the uk mortgage market noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah and on china real estate listen there was no doubt that in q4 the level of market uncertainty increased and the level of contagion risk on that whole sector of commercial real estate in china increased relative to q2 or q3 and therefore we thought it wise and prudent to model in additional stage and stage provisions to reflect that uncertainty that refinancing risk and that liquidity risk weve seen the market conditions ease a bit at the start of we think that is likely to have a benefit on the risk position on commercial real estate in china time will tell its still too early to tell how it will all play out its affected pretty much every private cre client in china as ewen said we have a mixture of poes and soes in that sector around about soes or so poes time will tell as to whether that sector has more losses come in or not but we thought it wise to model in some additional provisions based on that level of uncertainty ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc and then noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc we think sorry the one thing i will also say we still stand by the fact we have good quality clients that weve known for a long time operating in tier and tier cities with good properties but the sector as a whole has a level of uncertainty over it thats affecting all of them ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen sorry ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 and that yeah all of that thinking that noel has just went through is behind our guidance when weve talked about approaching basis points of ecl provisions for this year which i would note is probably more conservative guidance than is in current consensus noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc the uncertainty of the cre is within that basis points richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay back to indiscernible over to that side yeah aman aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd yeah good morning its aman rakkar from barclays i would have two please one back on rate sensitivity one thing thats always kind of i found remarkable for a number of quarters now is how low your usd rate sensitivity is i think even on the updated deposit passthrough assumption relative to the billion of deposits i think that you can imply from slide why is that rate sensitivity so low out of the us does it imply a lot of hedging is there something you can kind of help us understand there and second would be on aspirations for wealth management note the cautious guidance in relation to q1 i guess im specifically thinking about the border between hong kong and china reopening is there any way you could help us quantify what the potential benefit could be if we were to rediscover precovid level of activity for that business i mean i know it looks like the onshore hong kong insurance franchises has done really well last year so maybe theres a bit of easing there but anything you can help us put some numbers to that would be really helpful thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes in the us dollar theres effectively an accounting mismatch which is driving that lack of sensitivity and part of the funding base in the us is used to fund the trading book so in a rising rate environment the benefit from an accounting the accounting benefit on the revenue side goes to trading income so you dont get that normal rate sensitivity that you would expect i think on the border reopening if you go back to i think about of our new business sales on insurance were to mainland chinese so yeah keep the current profile of the domestic business in hong kong and assume going back to levels or higher as that border reopens aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd sorry just on that first rate sensitivity point then is that additional rate sensitivity that goes through noninterest income or are you saying that actually ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes that would be inclusion of that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd okay ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc but it would be yeah low hundreds of millions i think aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd okay thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and just on wealth weve covered it a bit in the slide there i just do want to reemphasize because it was such an important plank of our strategy asia wealth just draw out some stats net new invested assets in our wealth business was up yearonyear last year thats despite a bit of a slowdown in q4 but for the full year it was up trade wealth balances was up the invested assets of wealth was up so the net new money was up but the overall balance sheet of invested assets was up asset management was up year onyear thats full yearfull year and wealth revenues were up so thats with a relatively subdued sort of crossborder activity flow thats just driving the domestic markets what were also investing in is china so what were trying to do is we got a strong business that weve invested in in hong kong were now investing in china through the joint venture taking a full ownership of the joint venture of our insurance and wealth business there and organically invested in pinnacle people over the next few years so we want to drive stronger domestic growth in china stronger domestic growth in hong kong and then connect them through the likes of wealth connect and ph stock connect and thats where i think we got the icing on the cake you can say when the border opens up so i think theres still strong underlying growth for the mediumterm and although were signaling a softening in q1 theres a strong track record of the hong kong economy bouncing back and i think thats what will happen at some point later this year aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc guy next to you and then we pass the mic behind you okay guy yeah guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas morning thanks its guy stebbings from bnp paribas exane first question was back on income sort of building on the last question and thanks for the comments already on net interest income and sort of reflecting on where consensus is i guess for other operating income it sounds like its going be a tough start to and youve refrained from giving guidance for this year on revenues versus the mediumterm double digit guidance just wondering if your sense is that potentially a bit of a giveback to the nii upside this year from some of those trends hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 on although i appreciate its very difficult to judge in this environment but any color there and would you see that very much as a shortterm issue and indeed there could be potential catchup on that line as the environment normalizes so any distortion is really isolated to i mean indeed your mediumterm guidance is right to be of group suggests a rapid pace of growth to come through at some point in the future and then the second question was just on cost and thanks for calling out the restructuring is going to be above the line from i think thats a very helpful development it also goes against what were seeing at a number of banks in terms of talking about perennially higher restructuringtype costs than maybe weve expected in the past and in that context naught to cost growth over two years looks like a very good target to hit if you do indeed manage to reach that just wondering what gives you confidence you can do that if there are still some investmenttype actions we are in an inflation environment i mean is it just a sense of the amount of run rate cost saves coming through the business give you that significant comfort you can deliver that thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on the noninterest income i guess i havent made the same comments versus the consensus because that should be a ph hint but look i in q1 just weve had a couple of things going on firstly weve had weak markets in asia which is impacting both the insurance mcu the market impact and also impacting equity brokerage weve now got about half of the branch network temporarily closed in hong kong at the direction hkma as a result of the covid19 restrictions and you know q1 is typically our best quarter for selling wealth product and a lot of that is sold through the branch network so yeah if weve looked at whats happened in every other market with the omicron its been a threemonth thing and then the economies are reopened again so yeah we do think it is shortdated in nature and were sort of not trying to reguide on at this point so i do think that there could be some disappointment in wealth in q1 but by the time that you get back into q2 with the hong kong reopening we should see a really rapid recovery and on sorry what was the second question the second question guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas cost noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc costs guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas costs noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc costs hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc costs again noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and why are we confident on the north to ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah and so but weve done if you go back to you know the backend of the year that i joined you know we had a you know we grew costs at about that year we did exactly what went wrong not to do now which is we were trying to inflate the cost base in line with the rising rates and since then weve done an enormous amount of work to sort of embed good cost discipline across the organization in a way that didnt exist three years ago weve got a very well drilled cost program at the moment i would say if you just the investment that were making into various parts of the bank and digitalization and automation can drive out huge potential cost savings in some areas if i look at what im trying to do in finance at the moment weve got a big move to take all of our reporting into a single dataset on the cloud and run over our reporting engines off the cloud we think that can reduce operating costs and finance by to over the next three to four years and yeah its the same analogy that noel used in the front office with the trade transformation that weve done in the last few years so i think weve got confidence as we look at the combination of those investment programs going on in addition we are continuing to effectively if you were to cut our cost structure on a geographic basis what you see is the mature markets are declining so europe uk us canada which is allowing us to fund the growth that we want to put on in the middle east asia or in mexico so its a complex mix of costs actions going on across the organization but we do think that based on the work that weve done today theres pretty good bottom up grounding for the cost targets and we obviously dont put them out lightly because noel and i know that youll remind us if we miss them noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc so id say we got the bottomup analysis we got the benefit of a committed threeyear transformation program two years into it we delivered what we said we will continue that in year three this year so its a combination of bottomup and frankly determination i want that revenue benefit to go into the return to go into the pl not just to be spent on incremental cost and im trying to get a much more stable cost base to the organization over time and not have it cyclical high rates high costs low rates low costs id much rather have a much more efficient machine that is constantly reengineering itself and technology is playing a big role in it hence we spent more than billion on tech last year and if you take the guidance we said that was of our operating costs and we want to take were willing to take it north of of operating costs if you roll that forward over a period of time over through two or three years that will take billion up to billion so implicit in that incremental it investment is a reengineering of our fundamental processes we saw the impact of digitization on trade were seeing the same thing in the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 payments arena weve got a similar program running on our wealth business reengineering our frontline internet banking capability build it once roll it globally you get scale globally so yeah thats what were working on richard there was one more in there richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah weve got time for two more one indiscernible behind you and then indiscernible noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc this gentleman here in the white shirt hes well theyve both had their hands up a lot richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc and then martin well well see if we can still fit you in but we will have to wrap up okay q hi its ph perlie mong from kbw so thanks for the presentation just two questions one on income so well actually loan growth really so youve delivered loan growth in so sort of what gives you the confidence that youre going to be able to do midsingledigits in given hong kong and china still very much sticking to zero covid policy so sort of putting a lid on growth there and sort of related to that if you are thinking about midsingledigit loan growth and in a rising rate environment why are you only targeting midsingle digit revenue growth again sort of building on a previous question so thats on revenue side and then on costs youve talked a lot about digitization and investment in technology roughly what is the split between maintenance spend and innovation spend noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ill come ill do the last question on innovation and maintenance ewen you want to take the loan growth ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on loan growth i think yeah was heavily distorted by a couple of things firstly the impact of covid in the first half of the year which i think had a significant dampening effect on loan growth in the first half i think what weve seen coming through now weve had it in commercial for some time just continued quarteron quarter loan growth i think in retail were seeing very very good growth in mortgages both in the uk and hong kong despite what you referred to in hong kong underlying loan growth there in the mortgage sector continues to be very robust but the other big offset which ph has knocked is the rundown that weve seen in wholesale and global banking markets in particular which has dampened that growth rate but if you look at q4 the q4 growth rate i think it doesnt take much to get that growth rate up on an annualized basis to midsingle digits hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc indiscernible rate in cmb q4toq4 in asia loans was i think if you take trade q4toq4 growth in the balance sheet in cmb i think was so what you saw was a slow start in the first half of the year and then a pickup in the second half of the year trade grew faster earlier than term lending and term lending started to pick up in the second half of the year as economies came out of covid they first went to reactivate the supply chain and then they went to reactivate some of the term lending i still think term lending is quite muted at the moment i dont think theres a huge amount of capital investment taking place but were starting to see some early signs of that come through in q4 i think we just have to wait and see how economic recovery continues in the first half of this year and then your other question on how much of the investment in technology is innovation versus maintenance listen the term innovation can mean many different things to many different people so i dont use that term necessarily for it investment what im looking at is how much of that investment is fundamentally reengineering the business as opposed to doing care and maintenance on todays systems for regulatory reasons and i think more and more of our technology is going into the reengineering space and less into the care and maintenance we dont give a breakdown on that but it got a significant proportion of our investment circa over is going into the reengineering activities of the bank not just keeping the lights on and maintaining the existing systems were investing in reengineering and take trade as an example we fundamentally replatformed the whole software base for trade so were turning off the old and turned on the new turning on the new and that has multiple benefits it lowers the ongoing running costs of technology it lowers the ongoing running costs of the bank it provides new product capability a better customer experience better operational control were doing that in many other areas as well richard oconnor headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc im afraid that weve run out of time but the members of the team will be available outside for a cup of tea or coffee after to answer your questions sorry about the two or three who didnt have time to get on but over to noel to indiscernible noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc indiscernible to both of you because i know that you had your hands full richard oconnor headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc over to noel for the and over to noel for the concluding remarks please noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc listen thank you very much for attending today and for all of your interest and your questions to sum up im pleased with our performance particularly pleased with the return to revenue growth in q4 which i think bodes well for weve got a good cost control and were determined to maintain it hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22feb2022 based on the current interest rate assumptions we would expect a rote of at least in and a year earlier than previously planned weve made good progress executing against our key areas of our strategy and our transformation and im pleased that we were also able to provide our shareholders
