arizona bank trust reported the strongest deposit growth we were prepared to respond when the fed cut interest rates in the first quarter the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was basis points down basis points from the previous quarter this response along with our previously implemented interest rate floors on commercial loans enabled us to increase core interest margin by basis points turning to credit metrics i am pleased to report that we continue to see stable credit quality in the first quarter our nonperforming loans represented basis points of total loans at the end of the first quarter which remains flat when compared to basis points at the end of the fourth quarter overall nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets decreased slightly from basis points in the fourth quarter to basis points in the first quarter other real estate also decreased from million to million over the same period the delinquency ratio increased slightly from basis points in the fourth quarter to basis points in the first quarter nonpass rated loans improved from in the fourth quarter to in the first quarter and compares favorably to the levels over the past several years lastly net loan chargeoffs for the first quarter were reported at million or basis points for the quarter which was slightly elevated due to ph one million chargeoff of a commercial loan that was

statebystate roll out allows us to share key learning and best practices from each location as we cautiously expand inperson service to our customers with that ill turn the call over to bryan mckeag for more detail on our quarterly financial results bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon to everyone ill begin my comments today by referencing the press release which shows our reported earnings per share of ph per share this quarter this includes million cecl provision for credit losses and million of acquisition and integration costs and excluding these two items our earnings per share was for the quarter other significant noncore items consisted of a mortgage loan servicing right valuation writedown of million and of incremental covid related expenses so again this quarter core results were solid with financial trends and metrics also positive in most aspects now before i go on to cover the balance sheet and income statement im going to cover cecl right upfront the initial day one cecl adoption impact resulted in a million increase in the allowance for funded loans and million increase in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments for a total of million or a increase to our existing credit loss reserves which after tax also resulted in a basis point decline in our tangible common equity ratio this was right in line with the range we discussed on our last call and as disclosed in our recent 10k our first cecl provision this quarter was million and substantially all of the provision was related to the significant deterioration in the economic forecasts since the beginning of the year due to the effects of the covid pandemic in total the day one adjustment and quarterly provision net of million in net chargeoffs resulted in a reserve build during the first quarter of million which represents a increase from the yearend reserves at quarter end the allowance for credit losses on loans was million or of total loans and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was million or basis points of total loans together these two allowances result in a total allowance for lending related credit losses of million or of total loans this reserve bill that i just discussed reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment considering the effects of covid19 and the impacts from the various government stimulus programs along with a heightened management risk assessment given the volatility and uncertainty that exists surrounding forecasts in heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 this current economic environment we utilized the march consensus macroeconomic baseline forecast from moodys as our most likely economic scenario as the economic outlook evolves and our pandemicrelated loss profiles and experience develops we will adjust our allowance for credit losses and provisioning accordingly okay now lets move on to the rest of the balance sheet where total assets grew million during the quarter to end the quarter at approximately billion with a loantodeposit ratio of the tangible common equity ratio declined from last quarter to and includes the impact of our initial cecl day adjustment which reduced the ratio by basis points and an 18basispoint reduction due to the change in fair value marks on our bond portfolio excluding these two items the ratio would have increased basis points to investments also grew million this quarter and comprised of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just under six years and generate million of monthly cash flow total borrowings remain low at million or of assets at march our banking network had approximately billion of unused borrowing capacity so we believe that heartlands balance sheet with strong capital and loss reserves combined with ample liquidity and low leverage provides sufficient strength significant strength and positions us well to successfully navigate through the turbulent economic times ahead moving onto the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter or lower compared to the prior quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was which was just below the to range we indicated last quarter the decline of basis points from last quarter included a 16basispoint decline in loan yields due to lower purchase accounting accretion and the feds rate cuts during the quarter the lower loan yields were largely offset by lower interest costs on deposits and borrowings which decreased basis points compared to last quarter this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion compared to basis points in the prior quarter as a result the margin net of purchase accounting increased basis points over last quarter noninterest income totaled million for the quarter down million from last quarter significant items include trust fees and brokerage and insurance commissions which were affected by the significant downturn that occurred in the market halfway through the quarter combined these line items declined or from last quarter gain on the sale of loans was up million on higher loan refinance activity we also recorded a million writedown on loan servicing rights reflecting faster mortgage prepayments speeds moving to noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million this quarter down million compared to last quarter this quarter acquisition and integrationrelated costs totaled million compared to last quarter so on a core run rate basis our costs that exclude acquisition integration restructuring costs tax credit costs and asset gains and losses totaled million compared to million last quarter or a million increase this is due to the resumption of our fdic insurance accruals and an increased cost for equipment required to provide work from home capabilities due to the covid19 pandemic more specifically salary and benefits were flat compared to last quarter as salary costs declined on fewer ftes but were offset by increases in some benefit costs and mortgagerelated commissions occupancy furniture and fixture expenses combined rose primarily due to the increased costs for covid19 heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 professional fees increased million primarily due to the resumption of fdic insurance accruals which accounted for million of the increase the remaining expense categories were relatively flat compared to last quarter the efficiency ratio was for the quarter which is over basis points better than the same quarter last year and better than the to range we indicated on our last call the reported effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to same quarter last year and was slightly higher than the we indicated on our last call and with that i will turn the call back to bruce bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you bryan before i resume my comments i need to clean up an error i made in my comments related to other real estate i should have said decreased from million to million over the same period i think i said million and million so before bryan fell out of his chair i wanted to make that correction banding together we will survive this pandemic across heartland we have become even more collaborative more agile and more customer focused every day we are deepening our bonds with each other our customers and our communities heartland has built a fortress balance sheet and we have the financial strength to weather this storm when this storm subsides we recognize that the landscape will forever be changed were already looking to the future anticipating the emerging needs of our employees and our customers we will continue looking to the future anticipating the needs of our customers well continue to have our compass pointed forward that concludes our prepared remarks josh we can now open the phone lines for questions from our analysts heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a qa questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jeff rulis with da davidson you may proceed with your questions jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey jeff lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co on the capital again could you remind us what or an updated number on pro forma tce should the aim close in q3 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thats one i wasnt ready for let me dig a little bit if you want to ask next question jeff ive got it here i think ive got it jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co yeah i think maybe just broadly speaking if you talk about if theres some impact there just general comfortability levels i think much talked about maintaining the dividend is the plan and just kind of where the comfort levels are should that be as that flushes out even post deal thanks bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think im looking here but i believe that where we thought would be would be about projected and i think that was maybe getting through the end of the year so i think that had a little bit of earnings added with aim coming in the only difference i would say thats probably different now is the basis points that we lost due to the devaluation in the bond portfolio this quarter heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 we anticipated the basis points that we were going to lose from cecl that was already in yeah and so then well have to see what happens with covid and how we go forward but thats so we thought aim i think was going to keep us relatively flat on our metrics after you took down a basis points that we knew about for cecl jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co got it okay and then thanks for the detail on your current exposure i think could you speak to what aim has got on its books in terms of a similar level of crosssection of the loan portfolio i guess at risk bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah this is bruce our look at the aim portfolio we havent done the same deep dive that weve done here weve been really focused with aim around the impact of the oil and gas which they really have very little in the way of direct exposure but because of whats going on in odessa midland and other parts of west texas we think that its going to be how theyre affected will be much greater what i saw was midland was number one and odessa was number eight in communities affected by covid related industries with both of them over so we havent taken the deep dive but what we have seen is the markets that theyre operating in are severely impacted by covid19 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co got it okay and then one last one on the just on the credit side it sounded like on that commercial loan that led to the kind of the largest part of the chargeoffs that that was fully reserved for us so that makes me think that wasnt covid related but could you clarify kind of what drove that chargeoff there bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah that chargeoff was definitely not covid related and it came to us through one of our acquisitions and it was fully reserved and so bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc weve been dealing with it for multiple quarters bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay okay all right ill step back thanks bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 operator thank you our next question comes from andrew liesch with piper sandler you may proceed with your question andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies hey guys good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies hi i know its tough to give too much guidance at this point but it seems like just on the expense side a lot of things are trending the way that you guys suggested a quarter ago so is this a good run rate to build off recognizing there could be some onetime covid events in there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think generally we would be aiming to keep it flat and probably without covid wed probably working to get it down but that may be a little more difficult we will have just for some bumps that maybe you wont think dont think about we do have our merit increases which we will be giving employees here in april have already begun and then i think it really comes down to the covid and the creditrelated costs that well have to incur how much those are we arent sure i think the rest of that and i think we would have been shooting to and i believe we will overcome that merit increase with some other savings the other thing were working on we announced that we did the million of contributions we are working on ways for example maybe cutting back on some traditional marketing spend that maybe we can do differently and some travel and related its going to be lower just because people arent so theres lots of ins and outs that are moving bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah andrew what i might say is that we would have without covid we would have continued on a downward trajectory as we continue to look at leveraging the business so through aim we would have got additional leverage there but we are now going to have some covidrelated expenses and as the credit environment worsens we think that well have our collection expense could possibly go up so little early for us to kind of give any guidance around covid or collection expenses but i think in general you can expect to see sort of flat to downward trends pre that andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies thats helpful and then related to the ppp funds and whats going to creep through the margin do you guys have an estimate of what the fees are going to increase like that i guess the first slug and i can extrapolate the second indiscernible heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah so we did about billion of funded loans and i think we think that the number is going to be about of those maybe so its i think 29ish million if i actually started to get just a little bit of that cash in how its going to hit the pl andrew i havent got all figured out i think even the accounting profession is working on that because these will in theory come in and be forgiven and should go away in a relatively short period of time so how we bring that into income i think were working on but i think the numbers first wave just around 29ish million andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah andrew i might just mention how today went after the sba opened up ppp and clearly i have been working with our small business customers to get them ready to enter into the portal and we had about a thousand people queued up and we actually entered less than because the portal was down it was really a disastrous reopening today andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies got you thats helpful but kind of concerning for the government so i guess excluding how this might flow through the margin then the margin trend still just downward i know theres room on the funding side to cut and ph build this rates and i know the floor is there but is that the trend still so negative bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think youre going to see that core trend grind down as we kind of work through in this lower interest rate environment i dont think its going to be a fast grind down things to be slow you might see even see us be flat to just down a little bit next quarter i think weve got a couple of things that we can pull but not much in the deposit side were working on the very last pieces of that right now and then there will be a slow grind of probably if were at ph basis points now we might exit the year at down maybe basis points to basis points from there if things just grind down andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies okay thats really helpful bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i will just add purchase accounting is going to be really hard to predict because some of the modifications and other things are affecting the timing we might roll over loans how quickly those are going to come and pay down so i think thats going to be another interesting trend to keep an eye on that im not sure exactly how that will go but even probably more unpredictable than it normally is heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler companies okay thanks ill step back operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens you may proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi i hope bryan didnt fall off his chair when he saw the first quarter loan loss provision at million i guess my question is i mean the economy has unfortunately deteriorated since the end of march if things remain unchanged does it sound like bryan that acl to total loan ratio would continue to move higher under that scenario bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say it will i just dont know how much you know a lot of things will change we focused on getting where we needed to be at the end of the quarter but as i see it it looks like im guessing that the moodys forecast will deteriorate a little bit now we still have another some days yet before the end of the quarter so well see how return to work and some other things affect the economy but i think all things being equal what i know today its likely that that number will creep up yes terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then and thanks for the loan exposure in modification data i guess when you look at the industries at risk what specific industries would your highlight are you experiencing the highest amount of modification request and could you maybe share some modification data within those industries bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah terry actually if you look at some of those detailed pages for example you look at lodging the last bullet point on the far right does reference our loan modifications and im sure you probably didnt have time to look at heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 the slides in detail but for example that the lodging portfolio has had million of loan modifications through april bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and terry on a relative basis its page of the document theres a second section the restaurants and bars even though its about the same dollar amount its a higher percentage of that segment so weve laid out the percentages of the segments there its of outstanding balances at the end of march lodging and retail real estate are in the teens percentage so hope that helps terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yeah thanks my tiny screen did not go all the way to the right so thanks for pointing that out bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then i guess just the maybe last question it really sounds like the operation customer compass really paid off over the last days last year you were targeting was it million of benefits this year and then another million next year and part of that was on the revenue side are you still comfortable with those types of numbers bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i would say that that we absolutely are we actually overachieved from what we anticipated last year and the other thing i would say is based upon the last days we kind of were internally calling it customer compass we think there is a whole another opportunity for us to make improvements on because of what weve seen over the last days and our ability to reallocate our people change our processes and deploy new technology that enable us to respond the way we have in the last days so i think i dont think were quite prepared to give additional guidance but i think at the end of the second quarter we should be able to give more guidance on what can be expected out of that process through the rest of the year bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and as you can expect the revenue lift is hard to find in amongst everything else whats going on but i would say if you look at our ftes those have dropped another almost i guess people this quarter a lot of that is related to and a lot of the prior quarters drop was also related to customer comps initiative so as we found efficiencies and we havent replaced turnover and various other things and have utilized the capacity as we brought in thanks blue valley and rockford bank trust over the last half of the year so it really feels like were getting good traction on the efficiency side and i think were in better position with the tools we put in on the revenue side as well bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 yeah on revenue side youve seen our commercial loan growth which were pleased that that has really turned around the last several quarters i think that because of the customer modification well not modifications but what weve done on waiving fees on the consumer side and small business side were giving back some of what we would have for fee revenue but were pleased with what that core is before the waiving of those fees because of covid19 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you both bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from damon delmonte with kbw you may proceed with your question damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon everyone hope everybodys doing well during these challenging times mostly my questions have been asked and answered and thanks for the great detail in the slide presentation but im just wondering are there any concerns with the pending deal with aim and that it could not close are there any types of triggers in the merger agreement that that could result in the deal not happening lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi damon we have a double trigger we busted through the first trigger which is if were down from the original price meaning our stock prices down or more thats the first trigger so we busted through that obviously if you look at where we got the deal and where the stock prices at or now but the second trigger is that we would have to be down more ph in the krx and certainly we havent busted that weve tracked very very close to the ph krx so we really dont anticipate that being a problem the management team is still very positive at aim looking forward to being part of heartland so i really dont see any issues that could kill that deal and its interesting because lubbock has really done and continues to do quite well the locations however down in as bruce said down in odessamidland those would be more impacted not because there is direct lending into oil and gas but is the related support systems hotels motels multifamily restaurants bars so forth and so on that will clearly be impacted with oil slowing down so i dont see any problems with it damon we should be in good shape damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then with regards to mortgage banking a pretty decent quarter this past quarter how does the pipeline look kind of going into here in the second quarter and could we expect at least a similar level if not higher than what we saw this quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 yeah i would say the pipeline is going into the quarter look good and i think refinancing activity and other activity is good at the moment in the environment looking much ph pass the next couple months and whats in the pipeline is not an easy endeavor so i think next quarter should be as good or better i think we can do that and then after that i would be cautious because i really dont know youve seen some others like jpmorgan and others who are pulled back from the industry the industry we havent done that but it does make you wonder how the mortgage industry will do going forward and we will be part of that industry so lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc and damon as you know most of our mortgage operation today is being originated out of texas and primarily lubbock and ph as bruce mentioned lubbock has been very very strong in the pipeline what we expect in april and what we expect in may very strong but we just dont know beyond the second quarter what thats going to look like damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then just lastly bryan just to kind of followup on your comment about being a challenge to model out accretively yield going forward just given numerous moving parts would you say that this quarters million or basis point impact would you say that that was kind of what you were expecting or would you say that you might see it pick up a little bit higher like it has been in the past bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i would say before the pandemic hit i would say that would have been a little bit lower than we would have expected whether that will continue or not the pace of refinancing not refinancing but getting at deals to re underwrite them at their normal time that they renew is what im just not sure about with whats the modifications that weve done some of those might get delayed for to days and so that could just push out when we bring in the income ph book is what we normally would but i think it was a little bit lower than we would have budgeted or thought going into the quarter bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc well i think when bryan provided kind of some guidance last quarter we certainly didnt anticipate the fed action bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc right bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc you know the emergency rate cut so while we anticipated a little better i think were actually pretty pleased at how we were able to respond and we were ready on both the deposit side and our floors kicked in damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2020 okay and could you remind us what percentage of your loan portfolio has floors and can you just confirm that thats a driving factor and not seeing more erosion on the core margin given the big movement and make by the fed bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah so the way i usually explain this is of our commercial loans about are variable or what i would call semivariable another almost to have floors or about million round numbers of those million im sorry billion not million right indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc same thing i was doing bryan bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc these are billion these are billion so billion have floors billion or are in the money are already at their floor so weve dropped lower at the floor so we have a few where we put lower floors and just to guard against should we ever negotiate with customers to make sure we had at least something that wouldnt go negative should we ever unfortunately get into a negative rate environment so we have a few of those but the bulk are the floors kicked in damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay
