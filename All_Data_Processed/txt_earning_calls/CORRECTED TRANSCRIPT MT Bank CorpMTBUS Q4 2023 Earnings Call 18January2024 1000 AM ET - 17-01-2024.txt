bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 now lets turn to slide as we reflect on there are several successes to highlight we continue to realize the benefits from the peoples united franchise and are pleased with the growth in new england with mt finishing as top sba lender in connecticut ci loans grew by over billion or in aided by the growth in several specialty businesses brought over by peoples united this ci growth outpaced the reduction in cre as we continue to optimize the way we serve these customers in the most capitalefficient manner possible at the end of cre loans represented approximately of total loans our capital remains strong with a cet1 ratio near we continue to leverage our strong capital and liquidity levels to grow new customer accounts and relationships we also reduced asset sensitivity in while protecting shareholder capital and value however our work is not done we continue to recognize the value created by the merger with peoples united while also bringing more capital efficient neutral balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the longterm now lets review the highlights for the full year results for the full year were strong we generated positive operating leverage solid loan growth improved expense control through the year and growth in eps and strong returns our pretax preprovision revenue or ppnr was billion up from and we generated positive operating leverage net chargeoffs were basis points in line with our expectations and longterm average gaap net income was billion diluted earnings per share were up from the prior year as a reminder results included merger charges gain on sale of our insurance business and a sizable contribution to our charitable foundation while included a gain on the sale of the cit business and the fdic special assessment if you exclude these items adjusted diluted earnings per share were during up compared to our adjusted returns were also very strong with return on assets of and return on common equity of turning to slide which shows the results of the fourth quarter were also strong ppnr declined modestly from the linked quarter to just over billion ci and consumer loan growth was strong expense control was evident as adjusted expenses declined from the linked quarter and were down each consecutive quarter in diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the fourth quarter if we exclude the fdic special assessment adjusted diluted earnings per common share were on an adjusted basis mts fourth quarter results produced an roa and roce of and respectively next we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our fourth quarter results please turn to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in the fourth quarter down from linked quarter this decline was driven by higher interest rates on customer deposit funding and changing deposit mix partially offset by higher interest rates on earning assets net interest margin was down basis points from the linked quarter the primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift contributing a negative basis points the impact of higher rates on customer deposit funding net of the benefit from higher rates on earning assets contributing negative basis points and a negative basis points for carrying additional liquidity on the balance sheet mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 turning to slide to look at the average balance sheet trends average investment securities were billion decreasing modestly during the fourth quarter average interestbearing deposits at the fed increased billion to billion due to our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet this was mainly funded with strong deposit growth average loans increased slightly to billion and average deposits grew billion to billion turning to slide to talk about average loans average loans and leases increased slightly growth in ci and consumer loans outpaced declines in cre and residential mortgage loans growth in ci loans were driven largely by dealer fund banking and corporate and institutional businesses loan yields increased basis points to with higher yields across all loan categories of note the consumer loan yield increased basis points as we continue to benefit from higher yields on new originations compared to yields on runoff balances turning to slide our liquidity remains strong at the end of the fourth quarter investment securities and cash including cash out at the fed totaled billion representing of total assets the duration of the investment securities portfolio at the end of was about years and the unrealized pretax loss and availableforsale portfolio was only million turning to slide we continue to focus on growing customer deposits and were pleased with our growth in average deposits average deposits totaled grew billion approximately threequarters of that quarterly growth was from customer deposits average demand deposits declined billion reflecting a continued shift toward higheryielding products such as sweeps money market savings and time deposits the mix of average noninterestbearing deposits was of total deposits compared to sequentially excluding brokered deposits the noninterestbearing deposit mix in the fourth quarter was encouragingly we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter continue on slide noninterest income was million up sequentially the increase was largely driven by a strong quarter for commercial mortgage banking revenues growth and trust income and a small unrealized gain on certain equity securities other income also benefited from higher loan syndication fees the decrease in rates towards the end of the quarter drove the increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues turning to slide we continue to focus on controlling expenses noninterest expenses were billion excluding the million fdic special assessment noninterest expense were billion down from linked quarter and the adjusted efficiency ratio was largely unchanged from the third quarter the decrease was driven by reductions in other expenses as the result of losses associated with certain retail banking activities in the linked quarter and lower merchant discount and credit card fees the decrease in other expenses was partially offset by higher professional and other services salary and benefits decreased modestly from the third quarter as the result of lower average head count and seasonally lower benefit costs partially offset by higher severance expense mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 next lets turn to slide for credit full year net chargeoffs totaled basis points in line with our longterm historical average and expectations were set out earlier in net chargeoffs for the quarter totaled million or basis points up basis points over the linked quarter this quarters increase was largely driven by three officerelated chargeoffs located in new york city boston and washington dc and two ci chargeoffs related to an online retailer and to an rv dealer nonaccrual loans have trended down each consecutive quarter since the first quarter of that trend continued in the fourth quarter with nonaccrual loans declining million from linked quarter to billion the nonaccrual ratio declined basis points from the third quarter to the decline was primarily driven by the transfer of certain loans to accrual commercial payoffs and chargeoffs on loans previously deemed non accrual since the end of we have increased the allowance over million and the allowance to loan ratio was basis points ending at in the fourth quarter we recorded a provision of million compared to net chargeoffs of million this resulted in an allowance build of million this quarter and increased the allowance to loan ratio by basis points the current quarter build was primarily reflective of the commercial real estate values and higher interest rates contributing to modest deterioration in the performance of loans to commercial borrowers as well as loan growth in the ci and consumer portfolios turning to slide when we file our form 10k in a few weeks we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be billion compared to billion at the end of september we completed thorough reviews covering more than of all cre loans including maturities in the next months construction loans watch loans and all criticized loans the increase in criticized cre loans was tied to these reviews and to maturities where the prospect of continued higher rates could negatively impact performance of the portfolios or create shortfalls in debt service coverage or require interest reserves for construction loans our growth in criticized ci loans was not tied to any specific review but rather completion of an annual review cycle and our ongoing quarterly update upon receipt of interim financials generally our reviews do not incorporate any benefit of the forward curve at potentially lower interest rates the largest downgrades accounted for half of the total ci downgrades and represented a range of industries common themes include pressures from higher interest rates and labor costs during the fourth quarter criticized nonowneroccupied ci loans increased million accounting for of the total increase in criticized loans criticized permanent cre loans increased million representing of the increase and criticized construction loans increased million turn to slide and for more details on the criticized loan portfolio about of the increase in criticized loans was driven by health care by multifamily and are retail cre loans loan to values remain strong for these loan types ranging from low50 range for retail mid50 range for multifamily and high50 range for health care todate modifications at maturity have had sponsors generally support their loans through replenishment of reserves loan paydowns and enhanced recourse that is why our criticized has not led to growth in nonaccruals mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 our conservative underwriting and strong client selection has been supportive of these assets reflective of the financial strength of the portfolio diversification of our cre borrowers of criticized accrual loan balances and of nonaccruals loans are paying as agreed turn to slide for capital mts cet1 ratio at the end of was an estimated compared to at the end of the third quarter the increase was due in part to continued pause in repurchasing shares combined with continued strong capital generation at the end of december the negative aoci impact on cet1 ratio for availableforsale securities and pensionrelated components would be approximately basis points now turning to slide for outlook first lets talk about the economic outlook we see socalled soft landing scenario as having the highest probability but the possibility remains for mild recession brought on by lagged impact of rate hikes from last year we are encouraged to be continued strong performance by the consumer as continued job gains as well as wage growth above inflation helped drive consumer spending consumer spending has slowed enough to alleviate inflation pressure for many goods and services we expect that to continue in inflation figures remain above the fed target of chiefly because of rents and home prices while the prices of many consumer goods have fallen and inflation for consumer services has slowed we expect weakness seen in rent listings to play through to the official inflation data in helping to bring the headline inflation figures down our outlook incorporates the forward curve that has multiple basis point fed cuts in with that backdrop lets review our net interest income outlook we expect taxable net interest income to be in the billion to billion range and net interest margin in the this outlook reflects the impact of higher deposit funding costs and the impact of different interest rate scenarios as we have discussed we continue to carry a high level of liquidity our current level of hqla is about billion which is twothirds in the cash and onethird in investment securities in we started to shift some cash into securities this combined with other potential hedging actions can help protect the downside risk for nii from lower rates but may reduce nii in we expect full year average loan and lease balances to be in the billion to billion range we expect growth in ci and consumer but anticipate declines in cre and residential mortgages average deposits are expected to be in the billion to billion range we are focused at growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost the level of brokered deposits is expected to decline through the year turning to fees we expect noninterest income to be in the billion to billion range we expect solid fee income across many business lines lower rates will help drive stronger residential and commercial mortgage banking revenue trust income is expected to grow from current levels from higher valuations and increasing clients turning to expenses we anticipate noninterest expenses including intangible amortization to be in the billion to billion range this outlook includes our typical first quarter seasonal salary and benefit increase which is estimated to be million we also included the outlook to be approximately million for intangible amortization mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 our business lines are focused on holding their expenses flat while allowing us to continue to invest in the franchise and our key priorities these priorities include growing the new england and long island markets optimizing resources in both expense savings and revenue generation transferring our systems and processes making them more resilient and scalable and continuing to build out our risk management turning to credit we expect net chargeoffs for the full year to be near basis points due to the ongoing credit cost normalization in the loan portfolio and resolution of some stress credits we expect that the taxable equivalent rate to be plus or minus basis points finally as it relates to capital our capital coupled with limited investment security mark has been a clear differentiator for mt the strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary we take our responsibility to manage our shareholders capital very seriously and will return more when it is appropriate to do that our businesses are performing very well and we are growing new relationships each and every day while every economic uncertainty is improving our share repurchase remains on hold our decision to resume share repurchases will consider the results of the internal and supervisory stress test including the stress test capital buffer additional clarity on basel iii endgame regulations and continued stabilization in economic conditions as it relates to the probability of a mild recession that said we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future in the meantime our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients communities regulators investors and rating agencies on slide there is a summary of three enhancements we made to our financial reporting first we reclassified the substantial majority of owneroccupied loans and related interest income from cre to ci loans this better aligns with the classification with the underlying management and repayment source of the loans second in the upcoming 10k we are changing our operating segments to reflect how management organizes its businesses to make operating decisions allocate capital resources and assess performance third as certain categories have started to contribute more or less to our expense base we opted to include printing postage and supplies and other costs and operations and break out professional and other services as a distinct line item in the income statement to conclude on slide our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis while the economic uncertainty remains high that is when mt has historically outperformed peers mt has always been a purposedriven organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholders we have a long track record of credit outperformance through all economic cycles while growing in the markets we serve we remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth finally we are disciplined inquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital our integration of peoples united is complete and we are confident in the ability to realize our potential postmerger now lets open up the call to questions before which michael will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi daryl how are you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp im good gerard and you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good can you give us a flavor for when you guys look at the capital structure of mt as youre putting out its quite strong and we get beyond basel iii endgame and you see what your new stress capital buffer will potentially be what do you see a comfortable level of cet1 on a longerterm basis once those two unknowns are known and you can factor that into your thinking daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i would say it depends obviously on the environment that youre in and what whether were doing a transaction or not doing a transaction but you typically would want to operate with a buffer of maybe to basis points over whats required from the regulations and what we have there would probably be a way to probably peg it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good and then based on the experience of mt obviously over a long period of time you guys put out in your investor deck that your credit losses generally are below peers with the increases in your criticized loans that youve shown today the ci and cre do you still feel comfortable that you guys can maintain that kind of longterm track record of being better than the peers on the credit losses daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes yes i think its a long history here at mt i mean if you look at it we have been a disciplined selection on our client selection sponsorship and underwriting and our loss history is really low and kind of shows that the future remains uncertain but if you look at it its not a predictor of the past and were going to lean in on our client selection and underwriting approach has really not changed ltvs are strong and we have a really good approach to our underwriting our largest sponsors that we have right now are supporting their credits theyre putting money into credit refinancing and many of the chargeoffs that we realized in came from what i would say not longterm mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 clients theyre more financial or institutional type money but over the longterm we think that our client selection will win the day indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc go ahead daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc just quickly to follow up on that is it safe to assume that the criticized loans are more a reflection of market conditions rather than a change in underwriting standards two or three years ago that have led to these types of increases daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes if you look at where the increases came from multifamily its really more interest rate driven is really whats driving that it might have a little bit higher operating cost but for the most part their noi business models are performing very well so eventually over time i think that will cure itself and do relatively well if you look at construction construction overall was actually outperforming whats going on out there there is stress in some of the takeouts right now but as rates come down i think agency takeouts will actually help in that sector on the health care side right now its really more of a reimbursement problem and costs are going up it takes a while for them to get better reimbursement costs so i think that will help over time theres a lot of demand in that sector and i think as costs level off plus theres an active takeout market through agencies like hud from that perspective office if you look at office the one advantage we have in office is that we have a really good distribution of maturities over twothirds of our maturities start in and beyond so i think thats a positive and the other property types we have like ph retail and hotel are generally stable to improving gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the color operator and our next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 hi good morning can you talk about the puts and takes on the nii guide i know youre assetsensitive with the buildup in liquidity and the skew to commercial so if we get more or fewer rate cuts than whats in the forward curve what happens with nii and then i think you mentioned your you started the year putting some more or deploying some more of your cash into securities can you talk about what duration youre taking on there and what that would mean for the asset sensitivity daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so the guide that we gave at billion to billion i would say with our three basis point cut would be at the higher end of that range stand closer to billion i think from that perspective if rates go maybe cuts or cuts maybe your or maybe lower end of that range weve decided that over the next couple of quarters were going to try to move as close as you can to a neutral position we started to put some money into securities and we will continue to do some hedges and interest rate swaps were going to average in over time were going to do it all at once and just kind of dollar average in to get it more neutral so that we can produce stable and predictable earnings over time and not have impact on interest rates so i think we feel pretty good about what were seeing there and from a deposit beta perspective i would tell you that deposit betas maybe or close to peaking from that perspective maybe our net interest margin is close to bottoming out maybe in the next quarter or two so i feel actually pretty good that well be able to start to grow nii maybe towards the second half of the year and definitely into manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and maybe just a couple of short questions on credit i mean i think you mentioned that the reviews on commercial real estate do not bake in the forward curve so does that mean that if the forward curve plays through that criticized assets should come down or as you scrubbed through the remaining of the book that that could put some upward pressure there and then im sorry if i missed it but did you give what your updated office reserves were because i know you built some reserves during this quarter daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes yes let me take your first question first so we really dont take into account the forward curve when we go through the review that were doing a lot of the properties like i said earlier like multifamily is more rate driven than anything else their business models are intact so you have good noi i would say as rates fall if rates go maybe basis points or more that could be and probably will be a positive impact for our credit costs now it may not flow in as rates actually materialize and have to come through when were doing our next review but that pressure i think would alleviate and probably have an impact on the levels that youre seeing from that perspective from an office perspective that part of the sector is a little bit different because it also has some structural challenges so if you look at that thats going to probably play out more over time its going to be when leases mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 and vacancy rates kind of mature off were just blessed to have a longer time from a maturity perspective which is great planning from the credit team the top risk that we have there are embedded in the ratings and reserves that we have valuations that we have i think takes into account the risk i think were around right now so i think we feel good at that and if you look at the real teller will be when leases mature and you have resizing risk whats going to happen at that point but we have a lot of time for that to play out i would tell you if you just look at the signature transaction theres a lot of money out on the sidelines that will definitely come in and play and be there right now theres a difference between bidask spreads but there is money that will come into the market at some point manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great did you say the office reserve was daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so did the reserve build come somewhere else in the portfolio because i know you built reserves this quarter daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp we did i would say reserve builds were mainly driven by the increase in criticized if you look on our page that we have in the slide deck the actual office criticized numbers actually fell our increases in criticized were in health care and multifamily and in hotel and those are really ones driving the increase that was probably twothirds of the increase the other third was due to the loan growth that we had which was ci and consumer loans so you can kind of see that the build wasnt that large for the increases that we had we just really dont feel we have a lot of loss component because of the loantovalue ratios that we have and the collateral that we have on those transactions manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 operator and we have our next question from john pancari with evercore isi daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi just back to the reserve i know you cited that it did account for current real estate valuations and changes there and i know you gave us the ltvs you cited a few of them are they refreshed ltvs and if not what type of valuation declines are you seeing as you work through the office portfolio specifically daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so when we have done these reviews i would say we have about of the cre portfolio thats been a very thorough review obviously were picking the larger ones the ones that are in larger cities that might have more risk from a valuation decline were seeing probably on average about a decrease in valuations our valuations are probably current within the last year or so so we feel really good with that we continue to have reviews every quarter and continuing to be very thorough on how were looking at that but i think the reserves we have today i feel pretty good about john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you and one more just on that if i could on the criticized scrub that you did was that just that was that more of a scrub of the portfolio it sounds like the way you described it it was and if so do you expect less of an increase in criticized assets and related reserve build from this level daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp john i would love to tell you that this is the peak of our criticized we have to finish up what we did the majority of our construction loans we have a little bit more construction loans to do this next quarter and were always subject to getting more information in as we get new financials and new vacancy information and all that but i feel pretty good that we did a very thorough review of what we have out there we really looked in all the spots that we thought wed have the most risk and really took that into account but i cant here tell you today that were at the top but at some point hopefully we will be able to say that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right thanks daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes operator and we have our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess just on this criticized nonaccrual on credit in general given the work youve done im sorry if i missed this like should we expect so far the growth in criticized has not reflected in or been sort of translated into nonaccruals should we expect that to change as you see some of your customers feel more pressure given just the lagged impact of the rate cycle or could we still see nonaccruals trend lower and then what drives criticized lower from where we are today is it just time and maturity of these loans or could we see a pretty decent decline over the coming quarters daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i think the increase that we have today was basically a review of looking at everything that we have out there and i would tell you that interest rates probably was the biggest one labor cost was probably the next biggest increase there was a little bit of increase in ci as well and then ci there was nothing idiosyncratic there there was a mixture of if you look at it the largest credits seven different industries so its pretty diverse from that perspective so we feel pretty good overall with where we stand only of our criticized has gone into nonaccrual thats kind of what our historical numbers have been when gerard asked the question we really feel good about our client selection were seeing our sponsors and clients really stand up and really support these credits and we think that what we havent classified is the right direction that doesnt mean a few may not flip into nonaccrual but i think for the most part we dont really see a large period of losses if we did we would have had to put more in the reserves and thats not what were seeing or projecting ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 got it and i guess maybe one question on capital one another regional bank earlier this week talked about the need for scale for regional banks coming out of what happened last march you all have been acquisitive from time to time in a very deliberate way just talk to us in terms of one appetite to do bank deals as they come through over the next to months and secondly like do you see the landscape becoming rich with deal opportunities as we move forward daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt has always done acquisitions and have grown over the years our business model is really to stick to the regions that were in and to really meet the needs of those communities and we like to grow share in those markets so whether you need scale or not ive been on both sides of that right now and i would tell you that its not something you have to have its something if it makes sense i mean when you acquire somebody you got to make sure its a good cultural fit first and foremost that is critical you have to really make sure that if you get synergies that those come through both on the expense and revenue side so we closed on peoples were starting to get got all the cost synergies were in the midst of investing now more into new england and long island so were going to continue to grow that it usually takes i would say three to five years to really get the total performance from these acquisitions so we still have a lot of work to do from that im sure down the road mt is a favorite acquirer somebody might want to sell to us at some point but right now we got a lot of work in front of us and were focused on really making that its one of our top four priorities right now and were going to do that and deliver that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc excellent thank you daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator and we have our next question from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 daryl you mentioned the considerations for getting back to the buyback is it reasonable to think that maybe the last trigger or the last consideration is the stress test is the ccar and so just wondering is the second half of do you think the more likely scenario for restarting repurchases daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp frank i would love to be buying shares back especially at the level that were trading at right now i think its a really good value right now we just want to make sure that we go through the stress test we find out where our limits are we got to make sure theres a lot of uncertainty out there and we just dont want to go into a recession and if we do that probably would hold back for those purposes but were in the midst of really making a really strong bank were really changing it to be less relying on balance sheet commercial real estate and really more driven through offbalance sheet products and services and were growing other businesses both on the balance sheet and in fees and were really excited about that i promise you we will do share repurchases cant tell you when thats going to happen but it is core to our strategy and we will definitely do that when we think its appropriate frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a quick one if i could on the deposits noninterestbearing balances just your thoughts on you talked i think about deposit costs beginning to or beta is beginning to stabilize any thoughts on levels of noninterestbearing from here are you starting to see stabilization in balances around this of total deposit number and then as part of that can you just talk about how trust balances played into the linked quarter change in noninterestbearing if at all daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah no good questions so we did see through the quarter in the fourth quarter that our dda balances were starting to stabilize thats one of the biggest components of whats impacting net interest income is that migration from dda into sweeps hopefully that will kind of play out in the next quarter or two as that kind of stabilizes i think when you look at the retail side of the chain we still grow our cd book that will probably continue until rates really start to fall we didnt really see growth in cds till we got over so well probably have to go down a little bit before that growth probably slows down a bit but its important that we price that correctly in our disclosures we combine our retail cds with our brokered cds and i did say in the prepared remarks that we probably plan to shrink our brokered cds over time so that category will probably fall throughout the year but its probably driven more by nonclients from a trust perspective it had a modest impact on it i would say it wasnt that big of an impact from that it was really just drop in more in the commercial space for the most part frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great thank you mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp youre welcome operator and we have our next question from erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi daryl just a few followup questions please on manans line of questioning im wondering what is your current assumption for downside beta for the first basis points of cuts and is there anything about this cycle where we cant look at historical precedents in terms of volume reaction or cumulative beta reaction to the fed easing daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so if you look at our betas on a cumulative basis going up were now in the low50 range but that includes the brokered piece of that so if you take that away were probably in the mid and on the downside id probably say early on well start probably in the on the way down as well and as it goes down though we wont be able to sustain that because while we increased a lot of our rates higher in the commercial area and our wealth area and some of our institutional areas so those will come down as they went up so the retail side really did not come down didnt go up as much so it wont come down as much so as you go down or basis points youre actually going to have a declining beta impact is probably what youre going to see play out depending on how much the fed actually lowers rates but i think early on youre going to see something similar to that on the way down in the would be my best guess erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and a followup question on credit how should we think about the progression of your acl ratio from here i know you mentioned in the prepared remarks youd already built up your reserve pretty significantly as we think about normalization and whatever maturity walls you have in the cre should we expect that your acl ratios to continue to build from here i mean this is our first go at cecl with chargeoffs actually going up daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp all right i know it is we feel really good where our reserve is right now i cant promise you its not going to go up but weve been done a very thorough review of all of our what we think our higher risk type credits in the cre space and the commercial space as well so no promises that it cant go up anymore but we feel really good where we are today and where were reserved erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks daryl mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator and our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning daryl can you take us inside some of the discussions that youre having with your commercial clients and how confident are you that the ingredients are in place for a reacceleration in loan growth if indeed the soft lending scenario plays out daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp if you look at what our clients have been saying for the most part theyve been more on the sidelines and really been leery of investing in their businesses i think its actually i get kind of excited if the fed just lowers rates just a little bit i think the markets will get excited and youre going to have some things take off and therell be a lot more investment which will help the lending side i actually will get more excited on the fee side as well we saw a fair amount of activity just in december with the move that we had in the yield curve in treasuries where there was a lot of pentup demand and we were able to do some placements in our commercial mortgage area and you saw that flow through with some fee income so i get excited that if the fed just lowers rates just a little bit i think were going to have more momentum come through than what youre actually seeing maybe in the guide that we have bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful and then following up on erics question on the reserve rate trajectory within cre some has indicated that in this environment theyd be more likely to maintain reserve rates in office cre as chargeoffs occur is it reasonable to expect that there would be a lag between when we see peak losses in cre and when you actually start to release reserves daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp we go through the analysis i mean its a model right and its based on our variables so if you look at the variables we had this past quarter the variables for like gdp and unemployment were basically unchanged and they actually got a little bit better on crepi and on hpi so that actually helped in the reserve calculation so were using the macro variables coupled with how we think that the credits are rated from a credit perspective and it all comes together from a timing perspective i think its hard to say exactly when reserves will get adjusted right now we feel good with what we have given our risk is that we know right now on the credit side but over time probably there will be some reserves but it releases by you just dont know when thats going to happen its more modeldriven mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thanks daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes operator and our next question comes from brian foran with autonomous brian foran q analyst autonomous research hi guys so one question going back to this beta on the way down that i sometimes get from investors and i never have a very good answer and you guys historically been pretty good about thinking about normalized margins and drivers so hopefully you can do better than me we all talk about deposit costs as the problem but if i think about deposit margins over time and i know theres different ways to measure them but relative to fed funds the spread between deposits and fed funds is basically at an alltime high for you and the industry its a little less extreme relative to two and fiveyear treasuries but its still elevated or even just more simplistically like your deposit costs today are still a little bit lower than they were the last time the fed was here so i know a lot has changed over time but just have you thought about that does it make sense that deposit margins or liability margins more broadly are kind of higher than they have been historically and where on your worry list is the idea that because theyre pretty high to start with maybe as the fed cuts betas arent or there or daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes i would say and i think it was erikas question where when i was saying as rates fall the beta will start to come down just because the consumer side did not go up as much so i think well start off at a higher pace but as that comes down that will be less from that if you look at it i actually like the level of interest rates where we are today i mean were in the low is where the fed is if we stay lets say in the range or maybe even as low as as long as we price our assets and deposits appropriately to getting back to basic business and we get good spreads on that there is no reason we can have very healthy net interest margins for a very long period of time its all about pricing your assets and deposits correctly and making sure youre putting prepayment language in on your fixed loans and making sure youre pricing deposits appropriately but its a great environment for banking and margins i feel really good from that would we trend higher than where we are today probably over time but it really comes down to discipline you really work on the asset mix change at that time in times like that when rates tend to be in that time period mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 economy seems to be going pretty well so you probably have good loan growth out there and pretty decent deposit growth so i actually get excited once rates come down a little bit and we can really operate the bank historically i think well have good really good returns brian foran q analyst autonomous research and maybe as a followup your predecessor has the theme of kicking off this whole deposit and margin worry cycle at the barclays conference a couple of years ago i think at that time the original message was the nim was or and through the cycle you thought to was a normalized range is that still the thinking like well be at or so in but normalized at some point in the future is to daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i think thats pretty much spot on brian i would say darren did a great job in this role and he also called exactly what our chargeoffs were going to be in the beginning of the year and they came in pretty much spot on so he did a great job in this role but when i look at it and see whats happening if i call it right maybe we bottom in the next quarter or two in net interest margin then we can start growing from there so im pretty much in that camp as well brian foran q analyst autonomous research appreciate it thank you operator and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc maybe to start to actually start where you just ended so that normalized nim range to if we think about your commentary right you want to move the balance sheet to a more neutral position is there any reason in whatever a normal curve looks like we havent seen one in a while that you couldnt move to the upper end of that range i think most would be disappointed if you were like why wouldnt you move to the very upper end of that range daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 steven you know i dont know steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i ph dont think ill hear about it but just talking about like is there a reason that youre not going to be margin bank daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i feel really good at the way we are positioned what makes us so strong is we are really good at how we price our assets but what really makes it is that we are great at growing operating accounts and that funding source is really starting to come back on and growing nicely so we always have and probably will have a top quartile net interest margin so i feel really good about that we may operate a little bit lower just because were going to carry a little bit more liquidity right now were carrying about billion more liquidity just because we increased our internal stress liquidity scenarios based upon some of the learnings that we had from earlier in the year from that perspective so that cost us basis points this quarter it doesnt really impact nii a whole lot but it impacts your margin just because youre in the same water on assets and liabilities that dont make anything but i feel really good in this rate environment managing the balance sheet and doing the right thing for customers and for our communities is really what banking is all about and i think well be able to execute and perform really well in that environment steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and just as a followup i know youve had questions already on commercial real estate but if we look at this deep dive you did covering of all commercial real estate loans one what are you learning i dont know if youre talking to building owners as you work through that process but as these come due you have billion or so in criticized whats the expected work out will they put more equity in what are you expecting and then when you called out the office reserve is that a general reserve on the office portfolio are those specific credits coming due where youre anticipating losses thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes i mean the million is really a general amount there could be a little bit of specific embedded in that but the bulk of it is more of a general reserve from what were seeing from that perspective we are seeing our clients our sponsors really step up and really support these credits we think that chargeoffs that we had this past year were really more financial and institutional oriented but our sponsors because theyre longterm real estate owners of the property i mean they basically own properties where they want to own them in a certain block and city of where they have it so its really longterm oriented they tend to have really low tax basis in these properties and theyre going to support these credits over time so thats really what were seeing there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 when we go through and look at whether we should grade it as criticized or not youre seeing some pressure on the debt service coverage ratio once it falls under it goes into the ph which is a criticized camp but the vast majority of what we have in criticized is between and yes we had under in that level but the vast majority we have there so over time i think those will cure and wont result in loss for the most part we did raise losses up a little bit for some of that was really normalization on the consumer portfolio and then some of it is maybe working out a few more credits off but for the most part what we have in criticized is not materializing into losses steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats terrific color thanks for taking the questions daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator and our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning daryl first question on the securities book it shrunk a little bit but also the yield was flattish lets call it im just wondering how you could talk us through how youre thinking about both the size of the securities book going forward and also what are you picking up on maturities as theyre going back in if were starting to see this kind of flattish type of yield situation thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so we got a couple of things going on there so if you look at what we have right now were probably going to take anywhere from billion to billion this year and move from cash into the securities book over time were going to really focus on nonconvex type securities we dont have extension so if we buy something at a duration of three years it stays in a three years perspective yields that were seeing right now are probably in the mid plus or minus so i think thats going on pretty well the other good benefit that we have is we have about billion of us treasuries those us treasuries average a yield close to so those are going to reprice and were going to put those back out in probably two three four year type duration or maturity treasuries and were going to reprice up over basis points there so i think thats a real positive so were seeing a nice uplift in the securities portfolio the other thing to note and ill just switch over to the loan book ken if you dont mind is that on the consumer book our auto didnt really grow but the volume we put on in our auto lending was like basis points higher than what it was rolling off at if you look at the rv portfolio and that did grow some this past quarter that was also up a couple hundred basis points with a higher yield so from a reactivity perspective our fixed portfolios are starting to really show and perform and to have much higher yields mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes thats great actually it was going to be my followup on the loan side is do you have a broader way of helping us think through either the proportion of that book thats fixed and reprices over the next year or two daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i would say its mainly in the consumer book its the book thats probably going to reprice higher from a ci and cre perspective most of that is more floating because were more like floating fixed so if you look at it like that mortgage portfolio for the volume we put on in mortgage will be i think probably at attractive yields theres not a lot of activity were going to originate and sell all conforming so we generate fee income and not put it on the balance sheet but we will support our clients and wealth we will support our customers that we have for moderate and lowincome housing so there will be some volumes that go on in those portfolios so that way we reprice higher that would just be a little bit slower because the volume wont be as high ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and sorry one more final one just you mentioned earlier the ongoing thought process of getting more of the production offbalance sheet and kind of switching nii into fees im just wondering where you are in that process and buildout and infrastructure and within that do you have an idea of where you think that the right commercial real estate onbalance sheet concentration of the loan book should be versus the current thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so i would say our plans right now are to bring our cre portfolio down probably another billion if you look in the last couple years weve been shrinking cre about billion a year that gives us time to basically work with our clients and meet their needs with more offbalance sheet alternatives so were doing it on a measured pace so we can do it and still meet the needs of our good longterm clients from that perspective as far as what percentage were going to head for i know its going to be lower than i cant tell you you got a couple of things going on cre shrinking and the other portfolio increasing so my guess is youll probably see a drop a little bit faster than you what might expect if were successful were growing ci and some of our consumer book ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp youre welcome operator and we have our next question from chris spahr with wells fargo securities mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon daryl this is about expenses and the efficiency ratio i mean this is going back a while ago that you at one point mt had a to efficiency target i know that hasnt been updated in some time im just wondering what you think given that the efficiency will creep higher in based on the guide what do you think the efficiency will settle in whats your normalized nim daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so when you look at efficiency ratio its all about growing revenues faster than expenses thats really what i kind of look at from that perspective we really have a challenging time in growing revenue so much just because we got net interest margin coming down some my hope is that it levels off and starts to grow later in so we can start in and start to have positive operating leverage from that perspective id tell you im very pleased with working with the leadership team that we have here at mt we all agreed to come in and all business lines came in with flat expenses basically finding cost cuts to cover their merit increases and they kind of did that in their own businesses so i think that was really well done from that perspective were guiding up a couple of percent just because were making some investments in some really key projects like digital like data we have two transformations going on right now one in finance the other in commercial were investing in our treasury management businesses so weve got a lot of investments but given our leadership team i feel good that well be able to contain what growth we need there and that we wont have the goal would be to have revenue grow faster than expense is really what we try to shoot for and that will kind of drive good positive operating leverage christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc so as a followup do you think you can manage like a few percent growth in expenses in and kind of just based on kind of your budgeting experience notwithstanding like activity of volumedriven expenses daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes i mean when i look at the levers that we have on the expense side theres a lot of opportunities if you look at it our procurement and sourcing areas are continuing to improve and get better in that area i think we still have opportunities in our corporate real estate area to get more square feet down over time were really working with workforce management and really how to do our operations the most efficient way possible i think our call centers have a lot of opportunity from automation perspective one of our themes that we have in is simplification really trying to simplify what we are doing today so on the transformations that are going on how we do this well have less processes and much more simple way getting things done in a much more efficient ways of getting them done from that perspective mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 for me it always comes down to how we prioritize were going to prioritize in the priorities that we have in this company and i talked about those projects if we can focus on those and really not have any of the other investments kind of play out we can control expenses really well and continue to generate positive operating leverage as we get revenues to start to grow again christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc sorry and one last tickytack question bayview what is the do you have any estimate on what that would be for this year daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp we arent sure but i would say plus or minus would be our best estimate right now christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo
