the status of our merger process with sterling and at the end of our presentation glenn and i will take your questions despite the continued impact of covid expectations for higher inflation and supply chain and labor challenges we see increased economic activity and strengthening confidence from our business and consumer clients with respect to demand for products and services and weve seen improving loan activity which coupled with anticipated higher interest rates should benefit the banking industry and webster credit qualities remained remarkably strong for webster and for the industry as a whole with respect to our internal transformational project we continue to make significant progress on the strategic revenue enhancements and operational efficiencies across the organization in order to achieve our fourth quarter cost savings target glenn will provide more detail in his remarks related to our merger with sterling our teams have been working diligently and collaboratively to prepare for our closing and remain on schedule for all integration design planning and execution activities were in a position to close the transaction shortly after we receive the final regulatory approvals on our application in august we received approval from our primary regulator the occ and shareholders of both banks while we have no certainty on the timing of the final approvals were hopefully we will receive them during the fourth quarter based on our communications with regulators and the fact that there are no outstanding information requests we remain confident that an approval is forthcoming with respect to the strategic rationale for the merger i can say that through integration planning our team is more excited about the deal and the opportunities that the combination will provide for our clients colleagues communities and shareholders than we were during due diligence and that announcement the two organizations are very complementary with virtually no customer or branch footprint overlap and the strong commercial banking teams at both banks will benefit from a larger balance sheet and a more diversified combined ph loan book balance we are creating a unique commerciallyfocused midsized bank with differentiated businesses and a diverse and growing funding profile interestingly last week both sterling and webster were among five banks nationally to be recognized by coalition greenwich as greenwich cx leaders financial services leaders that have excelled in customer satisfaction customer loyalty and creating an environment that is easy for the customer to do business specifically each bank was recognized for customer experience in commercial middle market banking ill begin the financial report on slide our financial metrics remained strong we continue to execute on our fundamental banking activities organically adding new customers and deepening existing relationships across all business lines and geographies excluding ppp linked quarter loan balances grew by annualized despite nim compression the strong loan growth enabled us to increase net interest income by when compared to last quarter our adjusted earnings per share in q3 were third quarter performance includes million of net pretax charges related to the merger and our strategic initiatives tangible common equity grew by and is million higher than a year ago total revenue in q3 was higher than a year ago while adjusted expenses decreased our efficiency ratio improved to a decrease of more than basis points from a year ago webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 our third quarter adjusted return on common equity was and the adjusted return on tangible common was nearly our million provision was driven by strong loan growth and resulted in a reserve build of million in the quarter credit quality remains solid with key asset quality metrics continuing to be ph inyear cycle lows as a percentage of the portfolio npls net chargeoffs and commercial classified loans were all better than a year ago and our percentage of npls to total loans is at its lowest point since before the great recession im now on slide excluding ppp total loans grew from a year ago led by commercial loan growth of million or this is a very strong quarter for commercial banking with billion of loan originations up solidly from a year ago driven by growth in sponsor specialty commercial real estate middle market and business banking verticals loan fundings of million were up or million from a year ago consumer loans grew or million from second quarter and declined less than compared to prior year the linked quarter increase reflected stronger purchase mortgage and lower refinance activity during the quarter overall residential mortgage activities drove of consumer loan originations flat to linked quarter from a year ago im now on slide deposits grew yearonyear driven across all business lines core deposits grew by billion and represent of total deposits compared to a year ago while cds declined million from a year ago deposit costs continue to decline and were basis points in total in the quarter commercial banking deposits are up more than from a year ago primarily driven from municipalities and excess liquidity among clients across all lines of business and all geographies retail banking deposits grew yearoveryear with consumer and small business deposits growing and respectively retail deposit costs have continued to decline as well and totaled basis points in the quarter turning to hsa bank total deposits grew yearoveryear or on a core basis excluding the tpa balances total footings grew yearoveryear slide provides an overview of the transaction and integration timeline as i discussed earlier merger integration activities continue to be on track with the team from both banks working collaboratively and tirelessly to position us for success at close and beyond we are prepared to successfully combine the two companies and begin operations shortly after we receive the necessary approvals as shared in our merger announcement in april jack kopnisky and i both recognized that a critical element of success in bringing these two companies together is from a cultural perspective as such weve established a cultural integration framework that provides a clear and aligned view on the purpose and values of the organization and what we will expect from our colleagues in terms of guiding behaviors and performance the new executive management team is working together to ensure that our combined culture reflects the strengths that both banks bring to the combination with that ill now turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone we reported another quarter of solid results evidenced by strong loan growth favorable credit performance and continued execution on our merger and strategic initiatives ill begin with our average balance sheet on slide webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 average securities increased million linked quarter securities represented of total assets at september during the quarter we purchased approximately billion in securities up from million in the prior quarter purchases had a weighted yield of and a duration of five years securities called matured or paid down total around million with a yield of our average cash balance held at the fed totaled billion an increase of billion linked quarter driven by growth in commercial deposits average loans increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by an increase in ci commercial real estate and residential mortgages partially offset by ppp loan forgiveness during the quarter forgiveness on ppp loans totaled million and the remaining ppp loans were million in q3 we recognized million of ppp deferred fee accretion and the remaining deferred fees totaled million excluding ppp average loans grew million or average commercial loans grew million or while residential mortgage loans increased million or average deposits grew billion or linked quarter the increase was driven by continued growth in commercial transaction deposit products and was partially offset by a decline in higher cost retail cds average borrowings were flat to q2 and down billion from prior year as a result of excess liquidity borrowings represent of total assets at september compared to a year ago the loantodeposit ratio was at september the common equity tier ratio increased basis points linked quarter to the tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to as a result of balance sheet growth and tangible book value grew linked quarter and from prior year slide highlights our gaap performance and adjustments to reported income available to common during the quarter weve recognized a net of million aftertax charges related to our merger and strategic initiatives on an adjusted basis income available to common was million or per share resulting in a return on average common equity and a return on tangible common equity on slide we provide our reportedtoadjusted income statement on an adjusted basis net interest income increased by million linked quarter driven by loan growth and ppp fee accretion which was partially offset by a lower yield on securities nim of declined two basis points from prior quarter primarily due to an increase in excess deposits held at the fed partially offset by higher ppp fee accretion excluding excess liquidity and ppp fees third quarter nim was approximately flat linked quarter as compared to prior year net interest income increased by million this was a result of higher ppp fee accretion lower funding cost and loan growth which was partially offset by lower yields in the securities portfolio noninterest income increased million linked quarter primarily driven by fair value adjustments of million on direct investments and million on customer derivatives as well as higher loanrelated fees of million this was partially offset by a decline of million in hsa fee income due to lower exit fees on tpa accounts and a seasonal decline in interchange revenue compared to prior year noninterest income grew million this reflects an increase of million related to fair value adjustments on direct investments million from higher loan and deposit service fees and million increase in investment income this was partially offset by declines of million in mortgage banking revenue and million in hsa fee income the reduction in mortgage banking revenue was the result of holding more loans on the balance sheet as we deployed excess liquidity into fixed rate loans the decline in hsa fee income was driven by million in tpa closure fees recorded a year ago webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 adjusted noninterest expense increased million from prior quarter reflective of a million increase in performancebased compensation and a million increase in technology expense versus prior year non interest expense declined million due to our previously announced efficiency initiatives resulting in lower occupancy costs compensation and other expenses preprovision net revenue was million in q3 this compares to million in q2 and million in prior year our cecl provision in the quarter reflects an expense of million the adjusted tax rate was an increase of basis points linked quarter the net result is an adjusted net income of million or per share down from per share in prior quarter as you see on slide we reported a million linked quarter increase in core noninterest expense this was primarily the result of performancerelated compensation as evidenced by balance sheet and revenue growth and strong credit quality we expect to complete the execution of our strategic initiatives by the end of the year and remain on track to deliver core expenses in the range of million in q4 any variability would be related to performancebased compensation the cost savings on this slide are reflective of our standalone initiatives over the last six months weve made meaningful progress on our integration plans with sterling and remain confident in our ability to deliver of incremental cost synergies on a combined basis turning to slide ill review the results of our third quarter allowance for loan losses under cecl in the quarter we reported an million provision expense and a million increase in the allowance the allowance coverage ratio excluding ppp loans remained flat at with total reserves of million as we looked at the trend from q2 to q3 we established million of reserves related to commercial and residential loan growth and million due to credit quality and macroeconomic trends slide highlights our key asset quality metrics reflecting strong credit quality performance trends nonperforming loans in the upper left declined million from q2 commercial residential mortgage and consumer each recorded linked quarter declines npls as a percent of total loans are basis points down from basis points a year ago net chargeoffs in the upper right were in the quarter including million in net charges for commercial and in net recoveries for consumer yeartodate we have recorded million in net chargeoffs which is on track for our lowest level since commercial classified loans in the lower left increased million from q2 and represent basis points of total commercial loans slide highlights our strong capital levels regulatory capital ratios exceed wellcapitalized levels by substantial amounts our common equity tier ratio of exceeds wellcapitalized by more than billion likewise tier riskbased capital of exceeds wellcapitalized levels by billion with respect to the fourth quarter we expect average core loan growth excluding ppp loans to be in a range of to net interest income will decline million linked quarter primarily due to lower ppp income non interest income will decline around million linked quarter as a net result of nonrecurring fair value marks on direct investments and customer derivatives as indicated earlier core expenses will be in a range of million any variability would be related to performancebased compensation and our tax rate will be similar to q3 levels with that ill turn it back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn websters third quarter results demonstrate our continued focus on building longterm franchise value and maximizing economic profits through disciplined capital allocation process and strong execution in our differentiated businesses our colleagues remain committed to serving their clients while at the same time webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 preparing for a successful integration webster continues and the new webster will continue to deliver for its clients communities shareholders and colleagues lastly i want to say a big thank you to all of our colleagues for their commitment to our values and dedication to our customers and to each other with that sherry glenn and i are prepared to take questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey glenn maybe ill start with you on the deployment in the quarter on the securities book weve seen a lot of your peers be a little bit more aggressive in deploying cash what are your thoughts into the merger in terms of redeploying more cash into the investment portfolio glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure good morning chris yeah in the quarter we had an average balance at the fed of about billion and we have begun to deploy some of that so were below billion as we speak and so i think you would expect with a combination of both loan growth and securities deployment that youd probably wed probably end the quarter on average for fourth quarter of about billion christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay billion cash great and then maybe a question on capital once the deal closes you guys have a lot of capital and youre generating a lot of capital can you just john can you just talk about the buyback and the potential magnitude of a buyback john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure i mean i know when we put out the announcement of the transaction we showed a million stock repurchase to sort of plug excess capital there weve talked about a target cet1 ratio and then what i would say is what i always say which is wed like to deploy capital in areas where we think we can generate and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 maximize economic profits first clearly this company will have a lot of excess cash pro forma for the capital pro forma for the combination and we also generate a lot of capital each year so well then look at dividend and buybacks and certainly i think we have the capacity for significant stock repurchase but again if we find areas where we can accelerate loan growth look at acquiring portfolios of commercial loans or deploying capital into our differentiated businesses thats first choice but well be appropriate in our allocation of capital deployment christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i think you said last quarter the you think the pro forma company can do doubledigit loan growth sterlings results supported that last night any change to your view on your prior comments john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp chris its funny i still think to growth is absolutely achievable could we outperform that were going to have a larger balance sheet well have higher holds but the markets still not back to normal in terms of loan demand and weve seen fewer payoffs in the last couple of quarters so i think the prudent guidance sticks with approaching that doubledigit loan growth which we think as a combined company we can achieve christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator our next question is from matthew breese with stephens please proceed matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc just on expenses obviously the delta was driven by performancebased comp and it sounds like that could happen at least thats on the table again for the fourth quarter so could you just outline for us what performancebased comp was this quarter and is that a good range to consider for the fourth quarter webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yes so i think there was a bit of a trueup matt its glenn in the third quarter based on our performance so it spiked up in the third quarter i at anything i would expect it to be somewhere between million and million in the fourth quarter at most matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so i wouldnt pull it forward or push it forward matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then maybe if you could just talk about the health the strength of the pipeline obviously youre very optimistic on longterm loan growth but how do you feel about it over the next three to six months john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah matt im getting more bullish i think we talked last time around the fact that before you saw a sort of back tonormal loan demand a lot of these companies and individuals needed to kind of deploy their excess liquidity and then obviously with some uncertainty and you see supply chain issues and labor issues maybe people are a little reticent to invest but obviously we saw a good third quarter following a pretty good second quarter for us and our pipeline going into the fourth quarter is one of the strongest its been in the last several years and thats across all of our business lines utilization we still havent seen a significant tickup there so that could be a tailwind if in fact we start to see people on the asset conversion cycle in businesses like abl start to pick up a little bit so im getting more bullish and we are seeing a lot of pentup activity but again i still think theres a lot of liquidity out there and we havent seen line utilizations tick up so im still thinking were kind of going to be cranking as we get into the second and third quarter next year matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it and then just to follow up on the last question the near doubledigit loan growth on a combined basis in this market from boston to new york these are traditionally slower growth markets its going to be a much bigger balance sheet could you just walk us through maybe some of the areas that might need to change on a combined basis in order for you to get there or maybe its nothing at all i mean are you considering bringing some business lines national or adding new business lines could you just give us a sense for historically banks that big its just tough for them to get that kind of loan growth how do you intend to get there john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 sure i think our current assumptions of to really are bau so it doesnt were likely to continue in all specialized national and local businesses out of the gate and so weve done a lot of discussions weve done a lot of diligence we like all the businesses it gives us a lot of levers it gives us diversity across geographies it gives us some national franchises and so i dont think that we will make any significant adjustments to the lines of businesses that were focused on or the geographies were in over the short term but then and you know jack and you know us i think well obviously look at each of our businesses as we move forward and as we get bigger and think where are the riskreturn dynamics can we generate significant economic profits in that business can we maintain our competitive position maybe in some of the smaller niche businesses but the short answer to your question is how do we look at to loan growth next year its really executing on all the business lines that the combined bank will have currently and i think there are opportunities for us to go deeper in some businesses and accelerate that trajectory but thats not included in our strategic plan right now matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator our next question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey just zeroing in on a couple of aspects of loan growth i think you covered the sponsor specialty in ci what are you thinking in terms of residential especially in the q4 timeframe the seasonal slowdown and also you noted some strength in cre maybe you could talk about those two areas john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah our commercial real estate actually had one of its biggest origination and funding quarters in quite some time so theres obviously activity there but again we always talk about the dynamic of originations and pay downs and we had fewer pay downs in commercial real estate in the quarter and that benefited kind of a net growth youll see most of our growth continue to come in the commercial categories brock but we have had a couple of strong quarters in residential mortgage just given the dynamics of interest rates and kind of activity in webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 the marketplace and where people are moving connecticuts been the beneficiary of a lot of influx which is where we have most of our residential loan exposure so thats helped we do think thatll slow a little bit just given the seasonality fourth quarter in winter so that never really moves the needle ultimately for our significant loan growth much so i would say you can anticipate our residential originations and fundings to be slightly lower than the prior quarter and we expect the commercial pipelines which are robust to continue to convert into funded loans in the fourth quarter brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and glenn you touched on this in your prepared remarks but if you could just kind of review and kind of connect the cord for us between the operating expense we saw at q3 and your goal for q4 and kind of how we get from here to there glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so i did kind of hit on it and i think one of the bigger drivers was this performancebased compensation and so that was the largest driver that will drive that number there are other things that are sort of more seasonal whether its marketing transact timing of mailing campaigns and things like that but again when i pull it all together we still feel comfortable or feel that well hit that million around million and like i said subject to any variability on performancebased comp that million excludes like amortization and things like that just so you know its efficiencybased brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it okay thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks brock operator our next question is from david chiaverini with wedbush please proceed david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a couple of questions for you starting with on loans you spoke about the growth but i wanted to touch on the pricing loan pricing and on slide i see how the yield increased to in the third quarter im assuming ppp was a key driver of that but can you talk about the loan pricing environment john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure sure david its good to hear from you yeah the basis point quarteroverquarter increase in yield wasnt really on kind of the pricing it was on acceleration the biggest drivers were acceleration of deferred fees on ppp and other loans on prepaying so ill give you a sense in the quarter from an origination standpoint our yields actually held up pretty well in terms of prior quarter which is a good sign so were not seeing a lot of degradation in price webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 and they range from anywhere from kind of the mid yields for highquality commercial real estate to approaching on a good sponsor specialty deals around on business banking and middle market kind of somewhere in that range to so depending on the mix those are the coupons on our originations and we didnt see much degradation over the last several quarters which in a competitive market was a plus for us glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah just if i understand a little more so if you look at the third quarter versus the second quarter dave i mean the yield is basically flat if you adjust out for ppp i think in the second quarter the yield on the total book was and the third quarter was like so its basically flat david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for that and then shifting to hsa can you talk about the pipeline there as we head into the open enrollment period john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah sure weve had a good year in selling activity and as weve talked about our growth has been around market particularly in the direct to employer channels our partners healthcare partners have grown a little bit less quickly our pipeline this year is good obviously a lot of what we everything thats going to really matter for enrollment period most of that is kind of in process and we think it looks fairly encouraging right now id say that obviously this quarter is kind of slow as we approach the enrollment period the wild card in the last couple of years and through the pandemic with the whole industry has been less new customer acquisition and more the amount of accounts signed up with your large employers and with changing employment dynamics less hiring more disruption thats slowed a bit we always talk about to of our new accounts every year actually comes from our existing customers and thats kind of waned a little bit last year so what i would say is were hoping with a changing employment market to the positive that with a good selling season for us and onboarding of new customers better retention and a more normalized new account opening from existing customers we should see a pretty robust enrollment period so were enthusiastic right now and obviously im reticent to give you any numbers because we dont really have a line of sight and well start talking about it in the fourth quarter when we start to see enrollment david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great to hear thanks very much john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator our next question is from steven duong with rbc capital markets please proceed webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey glenn weve spoken about your deposit beta can you share with everyone just overall on slide your rate sensitivity analysis what goes into the deposit beta for the first say basis points and just curious in the subsequent basis points as well glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah thanks steven good question and ill refer you back to page where you see our short end up basis points and increased asset sensitivity of on ppnr it is the factor that we have lowered our deposit beta it was as high as basis points we did lower it to say between basis points and basis points but the fact of the matter is even in a rising rate environment were assuming a lag so the first basis points that we think the beta will be closer to basis points and in fact the second basis points basis points as well its not until like that third lift that we started to see that at least from a modeling standpoint the betas come back in and at that point wed say and then by the first basis points it would probably be closer to our indiscernible what we now say is our full beta of say so there is a lag in there that is built into this what you see back on page and its a wild card i mean there is a school of thought that says its going to be closer to zero for the first two moves so anything like that would be additive to our asset sensitivity steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah no i think thats something were all trying to wrestle with that weve never been here before and given the amount of liquidity in the system it just doesnt seem that glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp indiscernible steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc everyones going to be chasing after deposits i appreciate that and then i guess john just on the merger do you get a sense that the fed is just backed up or is it something more overall where the regulators kind of want to slow the process down a little bit webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp we think its backed up and as i said earlier we dont have a clear line of sight to timing weve had really good discussions and dialogue with all the various regulators so what we can say we announced the deal in april if you look at historic timelines on mergers were still kind of well in a comfortable zone so we dont think that theres anything sort of behind the scenes that could derail this transaction and so the only thing i want to say is weve answered all the questions we really like our application the merits of the transaction itself and so we think its just timing steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right appreciate it thank you operator our next question is from laurie hunsicker with compass point please proceed laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc indiscernible good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc glenn just wondering if you could comment on the jump in your leverage ph ss and just how we should think about that so from a million linked quarter where are your plans to grow that is that a chunk of where the loan growth is going to come in terms of your projection john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think laurie i think weve demonstrated over time a really disciplined approach in terms of making sure that our enterprisereliant lending whether its regulatorily leveraged or not the activities in that book remain within the appropriate level given the entire loan book thats one of the reasons why we think that this transaction will be so terrific is because it does give us some more running room from a risk management framework and a concentration framework to continue to grow sponsor specialty whats interesting is that that business has high originations its very profitable as you know and we think were kind of the best in the business at it but it also has a relatively low and short average life so a lot of times you see good originations and a lot of payoffs so again i dont think you will see disproportionate outsized growth over the long term and i think once we close the merger our concentration there is about half of what it was well be able to accelerate growth there to the point we can we are certainly not in a position right now where us the regulators our risk infrastructure our risk committee is concerned with respect to overall exposure webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and so sorry just to follow up so right so your billion of your billion but maybe asked a different way what percentage would you like the leverage piece of that to be when you think about growth going forward is that going to stay around the same or how do you think about that john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think im not sure we look at it that way i think we look at our overall risk rating there are some leveraged deals that are actually very highly risk rated and they fit regulatory definition so i think as a percentage of tier capital and reserves we kind of look at our sponsor specialty overall enterprise book and were kind of comfortable with whatever it is right now billion on a billion loan portfolio we still think we have some running room so if you look forward to a billion loan portfolio weve got significant running room and i think weve been prudent risk managers throughout and well continue to be laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great helpful thanks just can you just clarify the gain that you booked on the strategic initiatives of million what exactly was that glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so laurie its glenn that was a reversal of an estimate we made on severance liabilities and it was sort of driven by two things one is that we had a higher retention rate on some of our employees and the second was that there are initiatives that are tied to things like the core banking platform and loan systems so given the moe we sort of paused on some of those until we make those final decisions so thats really whats driving the million laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got it and then how should we think about that line going forward obviously youve got the mergers broken down separately how should we think about that line going forward glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp that line being laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc just a strategic initiative line so last quarter was million i mean are we youve got your branches already closed as of last quarter glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 oh i dont think you should you shouldnt you shouldnt yeah im sorry after the fourth quarter once we achieve or as we indicated well achieve the million efficiencybased comp expenses you shouldnt expect to see anything i mean thats ph what im talking about we laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp everything else will be indiscernible john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp related glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp right john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp right laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc that makes sense okay just last question if you can help a little bit on margins im looking at margin exppp it looks like it was million in june now million in september if we fast forward maybe two quarters so the ppp for the most part is gone and then sterling has rolled in how should we be thinking about your pro forma margin any help you can give us there glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah let me give you some color on what we see from q3 to q4 first and then because youre right the ppp does run off but its sort of offset by the deployment of some of our excess cash as well so if you think about it going into the q4 youll have say basis points less as a result of ppp coming down and then youll have some compression on the securities portfolio and that will be offset by the deployment primarily offset by the deployment of cash as well as i think we have a little bit more room on deposits you would expect to see our deposit cost down closer to basis points in the fourth quarter so that you would expect all things considered and i sort of gave the guidance on net interest income down million it sort of backs into like a 3basispoint compression into the fourth quarter on nim and then as you get into the first quarter you obviously dont have the benefit of ppp so you lose that but you more than offset that on the deployment of excess cash so it should bode well for core meaning core exppp net interest margin webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and sorry just one last question as we think about margin do you have an accretion number yet in terms of what youre thinking about for net interest glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc indiscernible sterling okay okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah no we indiscernible and its sort of went back and forth i mean i think were closer to where we were when we announced the transaction in april today given where the tenure is at ph and so in other words a bit of a dip in rates during the second quarter but i think were sort of back very close to where we were when we made the announcement but all that has to be where we were when we made the announcement but theyre all that that has to be truedup laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks laurie operator our next question is from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess sticking with the loan or going back to the loan growth side great great trends there in a market i guess that really isnt seeing overall growth yet i mean are you taking market share and if so where are you seeing the most success in terms of bringing new customers on especially with utilization rates staying flat webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its interesting and ive said this a number of times jared that particularly in this market there hasnt been as much trading of traditional like middle market were taking from peoples or citizens or theyre taking from us because a lot of banks including webster and im sure sterling as well have done a really good job of hugging their customers were seeing a lot of taking advantage and i think this is and ive described this to the market before one of the advantages of our commercial real estate and our sponsor specialty business is taking advantage of economic growth and activity with sponsors and i use that word sponsors to capture commercial real estate investors private equity sponsors family offices who are engaged in capital markets activities acquisitions mergers trading of property so when i look at this quarter for example were doing a good job in business banking of winning more than our fair share and i think weve got a strong business banking franchise from boston to westchester county so i think thats where our folks are fighting really well on the ground with good products turning credits around quickly and so i think thats kind of where we might be gaining share through growth i think on sponsor specialty and commercial real estate its the depth and duration of the relationships that we have with our sponsors and our commercial real estate investors where weve demonstrated surety of execution over a long period of time and those transactions are less competitive not saying were the only one but were the first call or were the second call and then we can kind of win that business and oftentimes its a new acquisition or a repositioning acquisition of a piece of property rather than saying were going up against an incumbent bank were going up against other banks and nonbanks to provide financing based on goforward economic activity so i dont think were gaining significant middle market market share in traditional multigenerational middle market companies i think were gaining more disproportionate share in the economic activity thats coming back after the pandemic through transactions jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks thats great color i guess shifting a little bit to the credit side credits very strong i guess i was surprised to see the allowance ratio stay flat can you give some color over how youre looking at the progression back to more of a day one level and how we should be thinking about that i guess in light of also when the deal closes youll have an additional supplemental credit coverage from the provision in the credit market john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yes as glenn noted almost the entire provision was related to robust growth on the balance sheet in terms of loans and mix and so were obviously very disciplined in the cecl process we rely on our models while its still positive going forward not significant change in the forward outlook youve got labor challenges and supply chain disruption as well so were sort of status quo but adding for significant balance sheet growth and i think what youll see over time is as the economy continues to grow and as our we continue to maintain strong asset quality theres an opportunity for us and that model will show us that the may be able to come down a bit webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 so i know a lot of people think strategically about their cecl model but we kind of stick to the regimen of the process and as we said theres nothing in the portfolio thats giving us concern but well continue to make sure that were providing for a life of loan projected losses over overall loan growth jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just finally for me maybe glenn you can just comment on the libor transition how thats going and then weve seen some data that shows that potentially the sofr spreads are a little bit better are you seeing that at all or is it still glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no theres i think jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible libor glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and so first of all were well positioned on a libor standpoint i think we actually have a transaction coming up that will be sofrbased this spread between sofr and libor for the most part i would think that the market is probably going to price based on that right so i think that remains to be seen but i would be surprised if everyone prices down to sofr without some kind of spread on top of it so we havent seen enough in the market yet to determine that but thats kind of what were thinking right now jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator and our final question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks so just if we can go back to expenses i just want to make sure that were thinking about the million right and i do recognize that if the merger closes we may not actually see the million but it feels like there just might be a little misunderstanding here so the million doesnt include amortization so that would make it higher and then are you excluding all performancebased comp from the million such that we should add webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no no no yeah ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry go ahead please glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp ken the if you look on slide weve thats the reason we call it efficiencybased ratio base is that weve excluded amortization even from the time we set the target so its always been that million has always been moved out my comments were that we feel confident in the million but with the understanding that if we were up say million or million it would all be performancebased compensation thats how we feel right now and thats not to say that we see that right now but if we continue to have the trends that weve had whether its loan growth favorable credit quality and things like that you might expect to see some of that but generally i think well be in that range of million john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah ken when we set the targets and the goals were setting performance at plan in terms of revenue performance and in the last couple of months and quarters weve actually significantly outperformed so obviously glenn trues up the accrual and youve actually seen that across a lot of banks this quarter and to the extent we significantly outperformed plan in the fourth quarter and there needs to be more accruals which were not saying there is right now but there could be based on some of the pipeline and trajectory that that could be the delta ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it it would be on top of the million if fees and things were positive okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp exactly ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i got it that makes sense glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp indiscernible see the offset in revenue ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 yeah understood okay and then just the other question just going back to the reserve obviously you are one of the only banks that sort of built or kept you reserve relatively flat this quarter i mean do you feel that youre at a good well sort of a good place for your reserve sort of on a webster standalone basis like at least for the near term and i guess more importantly also like post the sterling deal what is the right acl target if you want to call it a day one level that we should be thinking about glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp i think look at i think we feel obviously we feel comfortable with it thats why we posted it its our outlook on loan growth and i think sterling is very similar to us as a matter of fact as far as the coverage ratio anyway so its going to be driven by portfolio mix and economic outlook and so our growth our provision for the quarter was primarily driven by loan growth and so thats really what drove it i think if you look on the slide we had we took a little on for lower gdp forecast in and but the bulk of our provision for the quarter was driven by loan growth john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hi ken ive always been careful right being a former credit officer the reserve is what the reserve is as you look through your risk rating your probability defaults and your loss given defaults and then obviously youve got your macroeconomic factors and so were at the right level right now do from a management perspective when i look qualitatively at the portfolio is there room for that to come down on a combined basis as well when concentrations across a larger portfolio will go down sure there is and i think if you continue to see economic growth and the macro factors continue to improve and you continue to see good credit quality and good credit management for us and for webster that number can certainly come down and id also remind people we feel very good about our credit performance if you look back now particularly in commercial banking going back years i think weve been able to outdeliver and outperform but our sponsor specialty business does carry with it by definition because its enterprise reliant higher loss given defaults now they havent emerged in our execution over time but so when the mix is more sponsored specialty you also see us have a more robust provision so thats kind of the way to describe it but were at the right level right now continued execution and macro environment improvements that number can come down ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i guess thats why i was asking the what is that future number what could that future number be in a better environment other banks would refer to it as sort of their cecl indiscernible number but if you dont want to comment i understand i just thought id throw it out there john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp no yeah i dont think i can intelligently accept to say i think youre right there is some credence to looking at that legal day one if you believe that thats the right macro environment and the size of the portfolio and then up or down depending on the mix of originations and what the combined bank at a billion balance sheet which will probably lower correlated risks and concentrations could provide some relief i just dont want to speculate on it right now webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator we have reached
