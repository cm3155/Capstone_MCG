umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks everyone for joining us today we continue to see the benefits of our diverse business model which helps us drive key points of our investment thesis above peer loan growth solid net interest income and strong fee income contributions for the third quarter we posted average loan growth on a linked quarter annualized basis excluding ppp balances asset quality remains strong with net chargeoffs of just basis points and a 5million negative provision for credit losses sentiment in our markets continues to move towards more normalized levels while supply chain dynamics and rising material costs weigh on businesses across our footprint pricing and customer demand led strong loan growth turning to our third quarter results net income was million or per share and pretax preprovision income on an fte basis was million or per share slide shows primary drivers behind our results and ill provide some highlevel comments and then turn it over to ram for more details net interest income increased from the second quarter driven by strong earning asset growth and controlled liability costs net interest margin was versus last quarter impacted by continued elevated liquidity levels reinvestment rates core loan mix and repricing we are working to deploy the excess liquidity as prudently as possible as the rate environment changes while reported noninterest income declined for the linkedquarter it was largely driven by unrealized marktomarket adjustments in the equity holdings including a 107million swing to our tattooed chef position in the second quarter we saw positive momentum in fund services income and bankcard fees with increases of and respectively trading and investment banking income fell during the quarter on lower trading volumes after an extremely strong second quarter moving to the balance sheet slide has a snapshot of our loan portfolio showing the drivers behind our loan growth ci led the growth in average balances this quarter as we continue to gain share across our footprint prospects are recognizing us as a consistent stable player in our markets more than half of our commercial loan growth came from new customers this quarter during the quarter we saw some return of capex spending and while the growing number of middlemarket companies selling to private equity firms contributed to payoffs weve had success in building relationships with pe firms and are often able to participate in those purchases average mortgage balances increased from the second quarter to billion funded mortgage loans for the quarter were million including million in the secondary market yeartodate weve seen in secondary market mortgages compared to the same period in top line loan production as shown on slide was million for the quarter outside of ppp balance changes payoffs and paydowns were of loans above recent levels we do expect acquisition activity among middlemarket companies to continue which makes estimating payoffs unpredictable however we see a robust pipeline for the fourth quarter with opportunities across all verticals umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 on slide weve updated our exposure to sensitive industries we continue to monitor our hotel and senior living portfolios which stood at a combined million at quarterend representing of loans excluding ppp after analysis of mitigating factors including strong sponsors and guarantors we feel approximately million or of loans were in closer monitoring weve included this analysis again this quarter however as the economy continues to improve this will be less of a focus going forward slide and show asset quality trends im pleased with the reported basis points of net chargeoffs for the quarter and as i mentioned last quarter given what we know today and the quality we see across our portfolio we expect chargeoffs to come in near our historical levels of to basis points for the full year of you will see that nonperforming loans ticked up this quarter to of loans in line with the third quarter of this increase was largely driven by one credit relationship as weve talked about often well see peaks and valleys as we manage credit moving them to watchlist or npas but our historical track record has shown limited migration to loss moving to capital we saw improvement in our already strong ratios with total capital of compared to in the second quarter while we returned additional capital to shareholders through the increased dividend payment announced in july our top priority for use of capital remains supporting strong organic growth and as market conditions allow well continue to look for opportunities to augment that growth with strategic acquisitions along these lines we recently announced a single branch acquisition with approximately million in deposits in the kansas city market finally we recently announced the formal launch of our family wealth offering this is a registered investment advisor which focuses on providing entrepreneurial investment strategies sophisticated tax planning and generational wealth guidance to families with significant wealth we were already providing many of these services within private wealth management and we decided it was time to formalize the offering including hiring and developing a dedicated team of investment professionals additionally umb capital corporation which holds our sbic will be part of our family wealth offering and will focus on investment opportunities in private equity direct investments and other alternatives for our clients to wrap it up we continue to see positive momentum across the company and im pleased with our third quarter performance and im excited by the opportunities we see as we head into the fourth quarter and beyond into and ill turn it over to ram for a few comments ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner net interest income of million represented an increase of from the second quarter we amortized million of ppp origination fees into income and the overall ppp contribution to the third quarter net interest income was million compared to million last quarter at quarterend our ppp balances stood at million down from million at june approximately million in amortized fees remain at the end of the third quarter average earning assets yields decreased five basis points to due to a threebasispoint decline in security yields and asset mix exchanges including increased liquidity and a 659million decline in average ppp balances umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 our fed account reverse repo and cash balances now comprise of average earning assets compared to last quarter with a yield of basis points this increased liquidity along with core loan repricing pressure and mix changes drove the decline in net interest margin we continue to deploy a portion of excess liquidity as well as cash flows from our securities book back into our afs portfolio driving an increase of million in average balances from the prior quarter and nearly billion compared to the third quarter of looking ahead our internal outlook for any fed actions are in line with the current consensus for an early increase we remain modestly assetsensitive with more than of our loan portfolio tied to shortterm interest rates and over a third of our deposits in interest rate demand deposits actual experience when rates do rise will depend on a number of factors including the pace and source of liquidity reductions overall size of our investment portfolio mix shift within the deposit book steepness of the yield curve to include the 10year treasury yield and the number of rate increases as pertinent to our billion in pay fixed receive float swap portfolio as weve noted in our investment thesis we believe that our ability to grow our loan portfolio through market share gains potential to redeploy our over billion in excess liquidity coupled with opportunities to rotate within our earning asset base will also add to net interest income outperformance relative to our peers additionally a few of our fee income businesses benefit from higher interest rates such as money market fees in our corporate trust business the portfolio composition and activity trends are shown on slide and during the quarter we had cash flows of million at a yield of we purchased billion of securities that yielded noninterest income for the third quarter was million down million from the last quarter driven largely by marketrelated adjustments the market value of our investment in tattooed chef ttcf resulted in a 35million unrealized loss in the third quarter compared to a 72million writeup in the second quarter additionally as noted last quarter our second quarter fees had included over million in investment gains from liquidity events on portfolio companies held at umb capital corporation other drivers to fee income for the quarter are shown on slide noninterest expense trends are shown on slide expenses increased million or from the second quarter to million driven by larger performancerelated incentive expense and million in operational losses our effective tax rate for both the third quarter and yeartodate was for the fullyear we anticipate it will be approximately to our tangible book value per share has increased nearly during the past months to at september that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 question and answer section operator ill begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions first question comes from jared shaw wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey jared ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe first with the loan growth and outlook you know good growth on an average basis quarterover quarter i mean i see the slide with the paydownpayoff activity how should we be thinking about loan growth going into the end of the year should we you know can we expect to see average growth from third quarter with the impact of ppp rolling off or you know i guess how should we think about the strong pipelines versus some of the structural headwinds there mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i think the news this is mariner morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think the news is similar to what weve already talked about which is our top line growth we expect to continue to be strong payoffpaydown activity against that is an unknown this last quarter was i think representative of a buildup from the coronavirus from last year where we had low cap rates and low interest rates and theres some sales activity taking place within our largely our cre book but otherwise top line growth continues to look strong obviously exppp we continue to have the same trends as we always do with our loan growth jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 okay and then youd mentioned some strength in with pe from customers are you doing capital call lending with them or whats the whats the type of lending relationship that thats driving mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well we do do some lending into our fund services clients but thats not really what were referencing were really talking more about madriven pe lending so as companies in our portfolio or through relationships with pe firms get bought or sold were participating in that acquisition debt jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then looking at loan yields do you think that overall we have we sort of hit a bottom here assuming a stable rate environment or could there be maybe a little more incremental squeeze on loan yields mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp things remain very competitive they always do i dont know tom if you want to add were near the bottom i suppose thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah no i would agree with that its still a very aggressive environment and i dont expect that part of it to change if rates stabilize however you define that we may be near the bottom but its still always a competitive environment mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp probably not a lot of downward pressure but certainly remains competitive jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and just final for me any color you can give on that increase in ci npl whether its detail on the sector and then i guess what gives you confidence that the loss content could be low on that mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so it is as we mentioned in the call it is one credit what id tell you is which has been true for some time ive been in credit leadership at umb for years as have the two other gentlemen on the call with me today jim rine and tom terry and what has always been true about the way we manage credits is were quick to take action quick to recognize trouble and quick to manage credits and our history is very strong and long in not seeing migration much material migration from troubled credits to loss and we dont expect that to be any different on a goforward basis as there are peaks and valleys from time to time and typically very few credits so theyre not really trends in any one its never a trend in an industry its usually a particular credit or two umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay is that and is that throughout mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and we jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc this quarter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we would expect fullyear chargeoffs to remain within our 10year averages of to basis points jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and was that growth in the factoring unit mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no it is not from factoring jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp itd be in our core portfolio yeah operator thank you next question comes from nathan race piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi everyone good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 just a few questions on the fee income growth outlook it looks like the fund services unit is continuing to post pretty impressive growth over the last several quarters here and i appreciate the additional breakouts on slide along those lines so just curious as you guys maybe look out over the next several quarters total fee income growth has been in kind of the low to midsingledigit range over the last couple of years is that still a reasonable expectation to think about for and where do you see a lot of that growth coming from across the overall composition of your james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp nate this is jim rine we have had great growth in the fund services area and half of that is coming from new clients wont really give forward guidance on what we see for fee income i can tell you though through our institutional business our public finance area is up we anticipate additional strong growth there through the rest of the year theyre already having a record year corporate trust is up over weve continued to expand and add additional associates in that area and weve made additional investments in our healthcare services area to expand our directtoemployer network to where were expecting additional growth in the future there keep in mind through our fund services as well as some of the other business we are absent fees due to the rate environment and if you go back to pre we had roughly million in fees on a run rate so again not providing guidance but as rates do tick up we would see additional fee income in that from that category as well mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and the driver is the backdrop for all of those businesses continuing to be strong theres a lot of disruption in our competitors with in the fund services business weve been benefiting handsomely from that disruption and were a real strong player in the pe space so alternatives have been very strong right in this low interest rate environment alternatives have been a very strong asset class so theres a lot of growth there both in formation as well as asset growth within our customer base so and then infrastructure and rates all are sort of headed real rates are headed up and the anticipation of an infrastructure bill is speeding up activity in the public and corporate trust space and as travel has recovered our aviation business is also starting to see some positive outlook so a lot of really good drivers as we look forward and also our mortgage business is as weve talked in the past we have a lot of runway across all of our business lines and thats true for mortgage for us too even if purchase or refi even if the refi business slows down on an industrywide level our business is so nascent that we have a lot of opportunity and runway just within our customer base to participate in the purchase volume and so we see some legs for our mortgage business on a relative basis even if rates rise and the refi business slows down along with our card business for which is for a company our size is a pretty big business and were starting to see some nice momentum in card spend driving interchange revenue for us nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 got it thats a very helpful color maybe just changing gears and thinking about the trajectory of the reserve over the next several quarters you know you guys are back below kind of prepandemic relative reserve levels as we sit here today exppp how are you guys kind of thinking about the need to provide for additional growth going forward kind of within the context of the chargeoff outlook you know kind of remaining at that to 35basis point range going forward mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ram you going to take that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i mean were still not at prepandemic levels so on dayone or cecl number was basis points coverage and if you look at where we are today were close to basis points right so theyre still at the macro environment and the moodys forecast gets better theres going to be pressure on the allowance coverage ratio to go down further from where we are but a lot of our provisions typically to your point happens because of the outsized loan growth that we have so on that basis i think our relative recapture of the reserve might be slower than peers because of that because we continue to grow our balance sheet on the loan side and so that will be a good differentiating factor if you will nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense and maybe just one last one for me any additional color on the operational loss in the other expense line item here in the third quarter and i assume that doesnt recur going forward but indiscernible just appreciating yet any additional color on the driver there mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah thats something that will you know i think you see this on other income statements it just bounces around a little bit its not regulatory its not a regulatory loss its just a typical kind of business or business operating type losses that we will bump into from one quarter to the next based on our business activities and breadth and depth of our business nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it i appreciate that color i will step back thank you guys mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks operator thank you next question comes from chris mcgratty kbw please go ahead umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hi chris good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ram or mariner the deposit growth has been just off the charts im interested in kind of kind of an outlook for deposit flows particularly noninterestbearing how much do you think is sustainable versus a little bit transitory because those numbers are pretty strong mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp its a great question and when you get the answer will you give us a call no were weve benefited i think one of the reasons ours is outsized is a mix of business right so we have a large commercial and institutional business so the question so thats certainly a big driver which would be less transitory right so the growth of our assets servicing business the growth of our new aviation trust business the coming back of our regular corporate trust business and fees which is so those kind of comments around corporate trust and public finance business picking up and a rising rate environment all of those things would be the nontransitory part of the increased levels of liquidity on our balance sheet if you just look at the pre and the post sort of numbers the range right weve got an additional 45someodd billion on our balance sheet the question right the milliondollar question for everybody is is it a 45million in excess transitory liquidity or something less we certainly believe that its less than that because of the growth in our business lines and the complexity of our balance sheet and income statement certainly there is some excess liquidity on the balance sheet but we have internal debate ourselves really about how much there is so i know youre looking for more than that but i think a lot of it is going to be driven by the complexity in all of the institutional businesses adding core balances but theres certainly some excess liquidity on there christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay yeah its a guess but i appreciate the color my followup would be on expenses ive heard from many of your peers this quarter just inflationary wages pressures to run the business im interested how youre thinking about retention and the cost to retain and also recruit thanks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp another great question right as were all sort of feeling our way through this the pressures of workfromhome and the ph reachins from the coasts and just the competitive landscape for employment i think its early right to tell to understand some of the longerterm implications of coming out of covid and some of the i umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 think more permanent implications of the way weve been working in the last couple of years but i would say that we have seen some wage inflation and that we do not believe that is transitory you cant unring that bell but i think from a competitive landscape we have a great culture were not losing people our voluntary turnover rate and turnover rates in general are not much different than they were prior to the period weve gone through so weve been watching that and so we dont feel like theres any signs on the turnover side where we have been able to maintain and hold the people that we have competitively on the hiring side thats the biggest challenge because everybody is looking and everybody is in need but again we feel pretty good about the culture and the strength of kind of the consistency of our company as we look to hiring james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp yeah chris its jim rine the one thing that weve also been just dealing with i think most of our peers are dealing with too is just getting our mix and flexibility correctly i think thats what associates are really looking for in the workplace right now and thats something that were addressing and putting a lot and being very thoughtful with also as much as the wage inflation its just what the new work environment looks like and thats where youre going to see a lot of changes in the industry quite frankly mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and we want to be a thoughtful leader in that space so were not going to dig our heels in were going to make some real changes and adapt christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then thank you for that the last one would be ram on the ppp can you just remind us the fee that were in the quarter and then whats left ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so it was million in the quarter chris that includes both the origination fee ph and the interest income we still have million of fees left on the ppp program on balances of about million at quarter end christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks operator operator instructions next question comes from david long raymond james please go ahead david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey good morning david ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc the utilization rate can you talk about where utilization rate was here at the quarterend and how you you know if you expect that to change here anytime soon mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so it was at at the end of the quarter and it ranges from to and i would say that the way to think about it is you know the average is a low for us is low and you know if you think about a environment where theres a lot of liquidity in the system my take for the industry is its likely that that liquidity gets spent first before we would see something on the higher end of our range david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got you okay and then you know looking at the average balances in loans pretty good growth there in the quarter but the period end didnt show the same was there some accelerated payoffs or paydowns near the end of the quarter thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah this is tom terry as mariner mentioned earlier in his comments were seeing a greater amount of payoffs in our commercial real estate book principally due to low cap rates a low rate environment theyre either being refinanced in the nonrecourse market or there are a lot of just outright sales of commercial real estate properties and so we are seeing a greater amount of that this year and certainly in the third quarter than weve seen historically mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp but that pointintime question though thats just a thats literally just a point in time the growth i would id pay more attention to the averages thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp correct mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2021 than the point in time david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and dave ph because has the rolloffrollon on that and you can see those numbers in there and as a percentage of loans as mariner and tom both alluded to was a little elevated at of total loans david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay all right thats all i had thanks guys mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i might add that it wasnt asked but its something were pretty proud of were going to have a new tearsheet coming out in a week or so on our community development and our esg efforts weve spent a lot of time on it were really proud of the things were doing as a matter of fact id say esg is the new term really for some things that we as a company have always really cared about and were pretty excited about that so keep an eye on it you can go to our website and see our community development statement and within a week or so youll see our new tearsheet for where were making sure were getting recognized for a lot of the things weve been doing by detailing them in the statement were doing some real neat things were rolling out here in the summer a downpayment assistance program to reach into lmi neighborhoods and help lift people up and help increase homeownership and in our fourth quarter expenses we think that if things continue the way they have for us this year into the fourth quarter were likely to share some of our profits with our communities in the fourth quarter as we have been doing and anyway were real proud of what our team is doing and what our company is doing to make a difference and in the communities were serving and would love for you all as investors to take a look at what were doing on our website and keep an eye out for those efforts going forward so thanks for everybody joining today kay gregory senior vice president directorinvestor relations umb financial corp right it looks like we
