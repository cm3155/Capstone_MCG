and good morning everybody thanks for joining us today ill review the second quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will also provide additional comments and then well open it up for questions in the second quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or per share in the same quarter of last year and million or a share in the first quarter of this year beyond the financials the second quarter was an extraordinary one for frost to add our response to the covid19 pandemic weve been continuing serving customers with appointments in our bank lobbies to our motor banks with our online and mobile banking service to aroundtheclock telephone customer service and then our network of more than atms ill talk in more detail about our houston expansion and our paycheck protection program loans but for now id like to point out that we have been completing our organic growth initiatives and still achieving the same awardwinning level of customer service that frost is known for despite having more than twothirds of our employees working remotely in fact during the second quarter we learned that frost had achieved its highest ever net promoter score with a jump from to and thats a score that would be the envy of many well known brands and its a testament to our core values and our ability to consistently take care of our customers needs especially during trying times cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 more recently we learned that process among the banks that greenwich and associates sic greenwich associates has identified as standouts in their response to the pandemic based on customer surveys in fact frost was one of only two banks to be named a standout in both the small business banking and middle market banking categories i mentioned the paycheck protection program as of june when ppp loan applications were initially scheduled to end we had helped nearly of our customers get ppp loans totaling more than billion in the state of texas frost was number three in ppp lending with of the loans in san antonio fort worth and corpus christi frost is number one in terms of ppp loans approved and in san antonio we had more ppp loans than bank of america chase and wells fargo combined we did well helping businesses of all sizes but im particularly pleased that more than three quarters of our ppp loans were for or less and close to were for or less ppp applications have been extended into august and were still taking anywhere from a few to applications per day through july weve taken an additional applications for over million or an average size of about meanwhile were setting up processes to help borrowers get their loans forgiven weve heard many many messages of thanks from our customers whose businesses were aided by ppp and the efforts of frost bankers had helped saved hundreds of thousands of jobs those results are more reflective of our culture and our philosophy than even the numbers were reporting today for the second quarter average deposits in the second quarter were billion up by more than from the billion in the second quarter of last year and the highest quarterly average deposits in our history were grateful for the confidence our customers have placed in us during these times average loans in the second quarter were billion up by more than from the billion in the second quarter of last year and that includes our strong showing in ppp loans but our loan total would have been up approximately even without ppp in the second quarter our return on average assets was compared to in the second quarter of last year our credit loss expense was million in the second quarter compared to million in this first quarter of and million in the second quarter of that first quarter provision was significantly influenced by our energy portfolio stress scenario of oil at per barrel for the remainder of oil prices have since stabilized at levels well above that assumption and the energy borrowing base redeterminations are complete net chargeoffs for the second quarter were million compared with million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter of last year annualized net chargeoffs for the second quarter were of average loans second quarter chargeoffs were related to energy borrowers that have been discussed for several quarters nonperforming assets were million at the end of the second quarter compared to million at the end of the first quarter and million at the end of the second quarter last year at their current level nonperforming assets represent only basis points of assets which is well within our tolerance level and are level lower than our average nonperforming assets over the past nine quarters overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the second quarter were million or basis points for the period in loans those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to what weve experienced in the past several years the payment deferrals we have extended to customers due to the pandemicrelated slowdown have had some impact on delinquencies through the end of the second quarter we granted 90day cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 deferrals totaling billion of loans whose deferral period has now ended which is about billion only million worth have requested a second deferral total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher were million at the end of the second quarter compared to million at the end of the first quarter which happened to be a multiyear low a subset of total problem loans those loans graded and worse which is synonymous with the regulatory definition of classified totaled million for only of tier capital energyrelated problem loans were million at the end of the second quarter compared to million for the previous quarter and million in the first quarter of last year to put that into perspective the yearend total problem energy loans totaled nearly million energy loans in general represented of our nonppp portfolio at the end of the second quarter if you include ppp loans energy loans were as a reminder the peak was back in and we continued to diversify our loan portfolio and to moderate our companys exposure to the energy segment as expected and as we discussed in the first quarter call the pandemics economic impacts on our portfolio have been negative but manageable during our last conference call we discussed portfolio segments that have had increased impact from economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic besides energy weve narrowed these down to restaurants hotels aviation entertainment and sports and retail a total of these portfolio segments excluding ppp loans represented almost billion at the end of the second quarter like the energy portfolio we continually review these specific segments and we have frequent conversations with those borrowers to assess how theyre handling current issues combined with our risk assessments these conversations influence our loan loss reserve for these segments which is at the end of the second quarter overall our focus for commercial loans continues to be on consistent balanced growth including both core loan component which we define as lending relationships under million in size as well as larger relationships while maintaining our quality standards were hearing from customers in all segments about economic impact of the pandemic as well as the uncertainty ahead those factors have had an impact on our results new relationships are up by about compared with this time last year largely because of our strong efforts in helping small businesses get ppp loans when we ask these businesses why they came to frost of them told us that ppp was a key factor the dollar amount of new loan commitments booked through june dropped by about compared to the prior year regarding new loan commitments booked the balance between these relationships went from larger and core at the end of the first quarter to larger and core so far in and thats about where it was this time last year the market remains competitive for instance the percentage of deals lost to structure increased from this time last year to this year our weighted current active loan pipeline in the second quarter was up compared with the end of the first quarter the first quarter numbers were low and reflected the uncertainty about the pandemics effect on the consumer side we continue to see solid growth in deposits and loans despite the impact from the pandemic and the reduction in customer visits to our financial centers overall net new consumer customer growth rate for the second quarter was compared to the second quarter of samestore sales however as measured by account openings were down by through the end of the second quarter as lobbies were opened only by appointment only and through drivein tellers cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 in the second quarter of our account openings came from our online channel which includes our frost bank mobile app online account openings in total were higher compared to the second quarter of the consumer loan portfolio was billion at the end of the second quarter and it increased by compared to last year overall frost bankers have risen to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic and its resulting shutdowns with a mix of keeping our standards and sticking to our strategies along with a truly remarkable amount of flexibility and adaptability our houston expansion continues on pace with four new financial centers opened in the second quarter and two more opened already in the third quarter for a total of of the planned new financial centers those new financial centers include our location in the third ward where customer response has been enthusiastic even though our lobbies are open for appointment only our employees manage those new financial center openings while most of them are working remotely due to the pandemic and also while working nonstop to help our business customers ph stay afloat with ppp loans and that commitment and dedication is what frost philosophy and culture is all about as i mentioned earlier weve gained a lot of new business relationships through our ppp efforts customers that are new to us are learning what a longtime customer has always known that frost is a source of strength for customers and our communities and also a source and force for good in peoples everyday lives ive told our teams that their efforts are historic and heroic and im extraordinarily proud of our company that weve been able to help so many small businesses get through these extraordinary times ph despite that many pandemic challenges remain particularly here in texas weve seen the spirit and dedication of frost employees who live our philosophy and culture every day gives me optimism that we will help our customers find a way through this situation and come out stronger and now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas with some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil i wanted to start out by giving some additional financial information on our ppp loan portfolio as phil mentioned we generated over billion in ppp loans during the quarter our average indiscernible portfolio was about and translates into about million our direct origination costs associated with these loans totaled about million resulting in net deferred fees of about million about of the net fees were accreted into interest income during the second quarter looking at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the second quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter excluding the impact of our ppp loans the net interest margin would have been the basis point decrease in our reported net interest margin percentage primarily resulted from lower yields on loans and balances at the fed as well as an increase in the proportion of balances at the fed as a percentage of earning assets partially offset by lower funding cost the taxable equivalent loan yield for the second quarter was down basis points from the previous quarter impacted by the lower rate environment with the march fed rate cuts and decreases in libor during the cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 quarter the yield on ppp loan portfolio during the quarter was and had a favorable basis point impact on the overall loan yield for the quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the second quarter down about million from the first quarter average of billion the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the second quarter up basis points from the first quarter our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the second quarter flat with the first quarter with the taxable equivalent yield also flat with the first quarter at at the end of the second quarter over of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the second quarter was years compared to years last quarter looking at funding sources the cost of total deposits for the second quarter was basis points down basis points from the first quarter the cost of combined fed funds purchase and repurchase agreements which consist primarily of customer repos decreased basis points to for the second quarter from in the previous quarter both balances averaged about billion during the second quarter up about million from the previous quarter moving to noninterest expense total noninterest expense for the second quarter decreased approximately million or compared to the second quarter last year the expense decrease was impacted by the million in ppp loan origination costs that were deferred and netted against the ppp processing fees which were amortized into interest income as a yield adjustment over the life of those ppp loans excluding the favorable impact of deferring those origination fees related to ppp loans total noninterest expenses would have been up million or compared to the second quarter last year in addition to the reduced expense run rate during the second quarter due to the pandemics effects on the business environment we continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending and looking for ways to operate more efficiently as we look out for the fullyear adding back the million in deferred expenses related to the ppp loans i mentioned previously we currently expect annual expense growth of something around which is down percentage points from the growth guidance we gave last quarter regarding income tax expense we did recognize a million onetime discrete tax benefit during the quarter related to an asset contribution to a charitable trust during the second quarter excluding the impact of that item our effective tax rate on our yeartodate earnings would have been about with that ill turn the call over back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry okay well open up the call for questions now cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from our line of brady gailey of kbw brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks good morning guys its brady gailey phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i was a little surprised to hear that of the ppp fees were captured in the second quarter that seems a little higher than what some of the other banks have disclosed any color around how youre able to capture that amount of fees before any sort of forgiveness jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc ph not that were assuming we look at those loans brady on a pool basis and so were really just looking at it over the expected term of those loans we expect a big portion of those to pay off later this year so when i look out i think our current expectation is it will earn about of that fee in and about of it in brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect and then i heard your comments on some of the issues with the tax rate coming in lower so its actually negative for the quarter but can you just go over that again and is there anything else thats driving this tax rate to be lower than it normally is jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well unfortunately earnings are lower and weve got a pretty big municipal portfolio and obviously that higher tax exempted income drives down the tax rate and we would have had a low effective tax rate for the quarter have we not had that million credit but it would have been a tax expense but with that that brought us into the negative territory so now theres nothing unusual other than the million discrete item thats going through the second quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally from me i know on last quarters call we talked about the fullyear net interest margin for you guys being a little above i mean now that were one more quarter into the year i mean does that still feel like the right nim level jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think the guidance we gave brady was exppp thats the guidance you guys asked for and yeah im still comfortable with that brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc ph certainly operator your next question comes from the line of david rochester of compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc morning jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc definitely appreciated the reserve on the more atrisk look you guys gave i was just wondering what your energy reserve was following the chargeoffs this quarter phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc lets see jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 our energy reserve is about million so thats about a coverage thats down from the that we had in the second quarter phil mentioned we had about million in chargeoffs related to energy in the quarter and then also obviously with the cecl allowance calculation that we did if you recall i know phil mentioned it in his comments when we did just the allowance calculation last quarter we were looking at oil at and obviously weve got a huge improvement during the quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc right so i guess i had that at a little over million last quarter so with the million chargeoffs you effectively released i guess what million roughly is that right jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thatd be about right yeah exactly david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay got you appreciate that and then what are you guys seeing for new loan yields overall and securities purchase yields at this point in the quarter just with lower rates and everything i was just curious where youre seeing those yields come in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah unfortunately on the security side theres not a whole lot out there i think we did purchase about million during the quarter of mortgage backs i think and we were about million so no nothing great but certainly better than the basis points we were earning at the fed phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc and our loan yields have been pretty consistent with previous quarters so were seeing less usage of libor which is good given its going away but and were seeing a little bit of an increase in the fixed component with people taking advantage of the current rate environment but id say theyre fairly consistent david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay so if i back out the ppp fees from this quarter id probably be closer to where the average is going forward effectively i mean are you looking for any more loans yield pressure exppp just given what youre seeing in the market the price market phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc im sorry what did you ask about ppp i couldnt hear david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 oh sure i was just saying excluding ppp given loan yields this quarter and what youre seeing currently in the market are you expecting any more loan yield pressure going forward or are you expecting the loan yields to be relatively stable from here excluding ppp phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think it depends on what you have in have maturities versus on the fixed side versus what is being put back on that i dont its not the topic that were talking about a lot on we expect to see of a lot of compression there i think the interesting things that thing is going to be what were seeing as the replacement for libor we continue to move forward through but indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then maybe just one last one on the fee side just curious how much fee waiver has impacted service charges and the other charge lines and what the outlook on that is going forward jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc the fee waivers actually are a huge part of the second quarter run rate really they were in the tail end of the first quarter and maybe the first month of the second quarter we did see higher levels but really what we saw in the quarter was just really a lower run rate what i will say is as we looked at those on a monthly basis i will say that june and into july are stronger than we achieved in april and may so im feeling a little positive there the uncertainty of course is everything thats going on with the pandemic seems to be more pressure with the masks and the stay at home but for what we saw in june it was certainly stronger than april and may and early into july even a little bit better there david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc good morning cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc just to follow up on the energy reserve so you said were assuming in the prior quarter what level are you assuming now phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc go ahead jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc indiscernible as you know we did use so what happened obviously as you recall the prices were changing so much at the end of the quarter the first quarter moodys really couldnt keep up and so we ended up doing our own internal stress test i think in the case of this quarter what we did was we used the moodys price which is a barrel for the second quarter of and then moving up to through the fourth quarter of this year and then onto steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay im curious so the reserve decline this quarter it would be using some of the energy reserve in changing that how did the economic forecast component of the reserve changed in the quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well obviously from the standpoint of what were the expectations here i dont have the specific changes i think that we use the moodys consensus scenario and so that one if you recall is one that talks about gdp going down in the second quarter rebounds in the third quarter unemployment rate about in the second quarter improving to about by the fourth quarter and then i think texas texas is a little bit better there so really so if you want to go through the specifics of it i guess the net decrease in the allowance of million i think a lot of it was an increase in the yeah so that is kind of what was happening from an economic standpoint i think the economy was better i think that one thing that was different this time for us was really on the commercial real estate portfolio because the commercial real estate portfolio for us really ended up being a lot more sensitive to the volatility and the forecasted technical employment rate and the forecasted us gdp and so ph the model is very good for our commercial real estate portfolio its about higher than the model rate for our ci portfolio and we tend to believe that the loss rate for our owneroccupied commercial real estate and our ci should be similar both are underwritten with the assumption that the primary repayment source is the cash flow from the operations of the borrower so thats probably the one area where the model in and of itself was requiring a higher reserve and then based on the specifics of how our owneroccupied real estate portfolio performs we did make a reduction there i hope that answers your question indiscernible cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats helpful and then it looks like the covidsensitive loan exposures came down nicely quarterover quarter i think you called that billion last quarter you gave us the breakout of that in terms of energy restaurant hotel etcetera could you give us that breakdown of the billion jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and the billion does not include energy but what im showing is retail is about million hotels and lodging about million restaurants million aviation million and entertainment million steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc they have an combined allocated allowance of at the end of june phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc ill just give you a little more detail on allowance by sector so the reserve for the restaurant component was at on the hotels its reserve on sports and entertainment is reserve on aviation was and then the reserve on total retail combined was steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats actually really helpful if i could squeeze one more in just following up on the tax rate whats your outlook for the tax rate for the second half thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure i mean i think that adjusted that i gave that would have been the yeartodate rate without that discrete item in the quarter but i think its something in that range obviously its pretty low now i dont expect it to go any lower so id say in that to range steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to okay thanks for taking my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question or comment comes from the line of jennifer demba of suntrust cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc morning jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc your net chargeoff levels have been more elevated than as typical for cullen over the last couple quarters are you anticipating that will remain the case over the next two or three quarters phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc im not anticipating it i mean the thing that drove the chargeoff of it or so this quarter was really a resolution of those loans ive been talking about that have been moving through the snake actually its been a couple of years maybe even three in one of the cases finally gotten to where one was completely sold off the other is down to a level that we feel pretty good about getting the remaining balance back and its under million so not pretty but those have been resolved the other credit that ive been talking about for the last several quarters is the largest one that other than the ones that were on nonaccrual at that time when i began talking about it and you might recall it was a company that really needed to sell assets in order for its business model to work and they were trying to do that in a situation where capital had left the energy industry so its very difficult for them to do that and then whenever youd layered on top of that the impacts that happened with covid it was very very difficult for them so they ended up we ended up having chargeoff on that credit but i believe down to levels that again are very manageable so i feel good about those were the three largest credits that we had to deal with that they were the most seriously impacted so those have been taken care of there are a couple more that just as a result of the new environment in energy that are out there but theyre not big a deal so i expect to see energy chargeoffs not be the same level as they were in the second quarter as i look forward on energy i mean i think were going to see increases in problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher and i think the biggest impact of that in the second half is probably going to be in the service area services is really a big area for us its about million in round numbers and so if you take those credits that are related more to the drilling component of it that still hasnt come back even with a low million surprise so i think thats where youll probably see the increase in problem loans and we just have to see with regard to if there are chargeoffs there good thing about it is that people that weve met have generally been through multiple cycles and i recall service component of our component into the last downturn through actually performed better than the production side which was indiscernible cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 so anyway that broadly was saying i dont expect the chargeoffs to be the same level based upon the fact that so many of those were those legacy energy credits that weve cleaned up but jennifer were going to have to see what happens with the pandemic see whether or not they close things down again its nobody really knows the answer going forward but thats what i feel right now jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you and of the million in those greater at risk sectors how much of that million is in the energy restaurant hotel aviation entertainment and retail phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc i think that million might be the retail part of that fees the total of all the credits in those segments that we named excluding energy was i think billion jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc but i guess im sorry im not being clear so of your million in problem loans right is the vast majority of those loans in those sectors you mentioned phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc let me take a quick look and see if i can actually jennifer at this point no i mean im just looking at the problem loans this would be on commitments for those sectors so if you look at problems in restaurants be and these are round numbers around million problems on hotels are million problems on sports and entertainment around million problems on aviation no excuse me about million sorry problems on retail all totaled look like around say just under million problems on and thats pretty much it so the problems are spread around in different areas in there i got jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i dont know i think you said that the energy problem loans are about million jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc so you add all that together compared to million midyear youre going to get a good portion of it but i wouldnt call it the vast majority cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc but you could continue to use your term jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc and the other thing i wanted to give a little clarity on was our management overlay on energy so our price deck is to get that out there for oil is for is for is and then for is and then we stretch that at its how we came up with our management overlay in energy phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc and jennifer just to be clear i think problems are going to increase i mean just as things if we go deeper into this pandemic and problems wont necessarily equal losses i mean a problem means you get to a risk rate ph for example take hotels i expect to see some increases in hotel problems mainly because there were a couple of those if you look at that segment i think weve got in round numbers as i recall different properties and seven were construction lets say a third were construction and a couple of them moved out from construction into operation and you know well move those to problems until we see how they go and theyre probably not going to open until you could be confident say a occupancy number thats when were finding that hotels are opening they could cover overhead around again producing some cash flow at and so as those come into out of construction were going to immediately move those to problems so that doesnt necessarily mean no big issues but theyre in our view they should be considered problems as we look at how theyre doing in the early part of their operating status so thats just one example restaurants were going to have to see how that continues to go i think indiscernible jerry said id think that the problems there are going to be ones which are fine dining where you have to sit down the premium casual and then probably the other in the small places we probably got million of that kind of thing again restaurant problems havent been that large but we continue to see those problems continue to increase as the pandemic goes longer and longer so i want to be indiscernible the problems to increase we really do think theyre manageable and as ive said many times its kind of important what to do there in a crisis but its not nearly as important as what you do before the crisis and i feel good about the disciplines that weve had in place not that we wont make mistakes and youve seen the energy numbers that we reported where weve got to make mistakes and have made them but i feel really good about the way that weve done our business going into this cycle because its really hard to get your way out of it if you had than you were going to enter jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks so much cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe of morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc hey ken jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc just i want to ask about the ppp fees beyond the i think most banks that we look at basically would expect to accelerate the ppp fees when they actually get paid off which i agree with you likely in the fourth quarter to a good chunk of them but if youre recognizing of the fees this quarter and presumably over the next two quarter to your does that imply that when the loan a forgiven that you would see zero accelerated amortization of those ppp fees jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah it would have to be pretty significant to affect that because its going to be pretty ratable we kind of assume an average life of indiscernible is really accelerating but we do expect a big chunk of it to pay off in the third late third and into fourth quarter of this year so we expect those balances to go down quite a bit but yeah i think that we wouldnt necessarily see a huge peak in the recognition because of a huge amount of forgiveness if you will but it could be accelerated lets say if they evolve all of a sudden the average life that were assuming which is months if that were a lot shorter yeah then that could be accelerated i currently dont expect that to happen theres a lot of unknowns obviously out there associated with the portfolio we do expect that a big part of the forgiveness will happen after that 24week period but again as phil mentioned in his comments i mean we are working on helping the customers through that forgiveness process but i have to be honest some of the things that i have seen for others ph to me and all across the board on how people recognizing those fees in my mind ours really wasnt more aggressive than others and in fact it was less aggressive than some of the ones that i saw but obviously we feel good about where were at ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and is it right to assume that youll recognize another in each of and for the fees cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think our brand assumption is something close to that yes ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc because i think what i mentioned was yeah our expectation is this year so yeah thats an easy way to get there ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and heaven forbid but if those loans actually dont get forgiven and they get pushed out what happens to the fees because it seems like you would have recognized all the revenues upfront or beforehand jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah heaven forbid as you said yeah i mean yeah we have we are recognizing the fees as we go along ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay maybe just a slightly different question in terms of expenses the new growth rate yearoveryear its just doing back of the envelope numbers it looks like that put your expenses i think back in the if got my numbers right call it the ph million range let me make sure i got this yeah the ph million to million range is that kind of where youre thinking about for the next couple quarters jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that again yeah its sort of simple math you wouldnt be too far off from that number given the guidance weve given ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc sure jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess first jerry just very quickly as a followup on the margin so i guess i heard you say you expect the full year margin to be slightly over ex all things ppp but could you tell us the amount of security that are coming up for maturity over the backhalf of the year and im assuming that the yields on the maturing cash flows are about and what im trying to get to is it seems like the margin will be somewhere in the ph by the time we exit with additional slight pressure beyond that so just want to make sure we capture that correctly jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that weve got i think that a big part of it is here in the third quarter if we look at our cash flow from we had some agencies that were maturing in july so im thinking were around million million between now and the end of the year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and is there any component of the deposits that came in that you expect to leave the bank which may be beneficial to the margin in terms of excess liquidity leaving jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah obviously were a little bit of an unprecedented time here some of it we do expect some of the increase we do think is associated with those ppp loans and although it appears that some of its getting parked you would expect that some of that will get spent out our modeling assumptions indicate that we do see some of it going on were not comfortable disclosing how much at this point but really to be honest with you its tough to tell they continue to grow when we look at the 12month look back on deposits really about of our growth both on the consumer side and the commercial side is really from our own customer augmentation and we continue to have good growth from new customers about but at this point it really gets tough so i think theres just a lot of uncertainty people are being obviously more careful with cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 their money and we havent really didnt really see a big decrease related to tax payments or anything that ive seen at this point but obviously with the pushback wed expected some movement down in july so i think its a little bit hard to tell i think were all kind of trying to grapple with whats going to go on with deposits weve never been one to shy away from accepting deposits obviously we like the fact that a lot of the new relationships that phil mentioned in some cases are going to start with deposits but i think our growth from a standpoint of compared to the second quarter last year if i remember correctly it is really commercial dda which were not paying any interest on ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess if i could ask one question phil just in term with i guess its tied to credit but when you look at the environment today across your markets in texas just talk to us around like do you have a sense of confidence that things get better like did you see things deteriorate ph intraquarter and like some of the covid cases increase in texas and how do you see this playing out visàvis ph going to align when texas actually outperformed quite nicely given what we are seeing with covid given what we are seeing with the energy sector just give us a big picture view of how to think about how the economy might play out over the next months phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc well i think the view of the economy over the last i kind of stated some the economies on the other hand economy there are some parts of it that are doing well we talked to both dealers we talked to the customer there weve got a large both dealer have been around since the had their best month for their history in may automobile dealers have been around for generations best month in history in may ph diamond distributors up in may yearoveryear there are a number of areas like that if you look at the heavy equipment dealer thats if you look at the parts of their business that are not related to energy theyre still positive theres lots of roadwork going on theres lots of construction going on on the other hand youve got anything related to the energy piece is pretty much dead because that relates to sort of the ph service fracking piece so youve good pipelines from customers as we talk to them on the construction side through november on the other hand theres concern that with the municipal and fiscal situations at state and local levels that you may see reductions in construction and roadwork and those kind of things because of the focus on basic services so the pipelines going into theres some concern on that and youre seeing you got the energy piece which weve been talking about which has improved greatly up to or so north of that on the other hand youre really not seeing any drilling right now so the service side is going to be weak and its going to depend i think just being a participant in texas right now sort of how the authorities decide to handle the situation with cases increasing i think theres a lot of activity people are using mask i mean usually youd go into a grocery store before id say three four weeks ago maybe twothirds of the people have mask on you go to a place today you almost never see anyone without one and so some of the local authorities ive talked to here realized that our hand has been dealt over the last three weeks or so past memorial and then also past memorial day because of what happened with infections and without a mandatory mask situation but now that people have been more careful theres hope that thats going to help the situation going forward so i think that the next six months are going to be probably just heavy lifting on just grinding through the general economic impacts on the portfolio and hopefully we wont be sitting here in the same situation at the end of the cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 first quarter having done this because i think some of these businesses these smaller businesses et cetera are going to run out of steam without some kind of continued fiscal stimulus so i know thats not definitive truth is nobody knows but there are some positive things going on but on the other hand there are negative things that were all dealing with and i think at end of the day this really relates to some kind of medical solution either through really effective therapeutics or through some kind of vaccine and thats what were hoping for ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats good color thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter of wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i was wondering on this houston branch expansion in the past you said it takes about months for breakeven youll lose about million before breakeven but im just wondering in this type of environment that were in how that impacts those two metrics phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc well those are average numbers as we went into the program ill tell you maybe the best thing for me to do is just give you an update on how the houston expansion is going with regard to our pro forma which we would base those numbers on were ahead on relationships so call it ahead of target on relationships were slightly below target on total deposits were about of target on deposits today but the momentum is positive going forward and then on loans were plus of our target on the lending side so i think were ahead of those numbers that we were assuming that we gave when we entered into the program and things have been going better than we expected one thing ill point out is that half of the new relationships that were experiencing in the houston market are related to the expansion effort and new relationship growth in houston yearoveryear is up and i also think that houston is the only market we have for loan opportunities are positive versus a year ago and so not only are the branches performing better but i think theres some overall impact in the entire market thats benefiting from the effort so id say sometimes in the heat of battle the fog of war its hard to focus on what are you doing right for the longterm im very excited and pleased with the expansion strategy and i think these numbers have shown that were going to reach this breakeven numbers faster and the impact is going to be less than we anticipated peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats very helpful on the expenses jerry you keep lowering that expense guidance and you last quarter you put more focus on discretionary expenses and hiring and then the benefit with these stayathome restrictions what are some of the drivers that youre able to lower that expense growth target again this quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think this quarter some of what were dealing with and you hit the nail on the head a big part of it obviously the run rate is much lower and without knowing how that turns around or when it turns around we just thought it made sense to lower our guidance but i think if i look at travel meals entertainment that sort of stuff compared to the second quarter of last year its probably down million marketing expenses this quarter were down quite a bit we do expect that those will go up in the second quarter we kind of slowed down some of the things were doing but we want to continue to have our name out there phil talked a little bit about our net promoter scores and were very sensitive to whats going on in houston so i envision well spend some dollars there theres some discretionary stuff that we can do associated with performance obviously its not a great year so thats coming into the reduction that were projecting here and really just looking for ways to be efficient theres a lot of things that we learned phil talked about our success on the ppp program i mean a lot of that we couldnt have done without really improving some of our back office processes and that team really through it and through our operations area put lot of processes in place to automate a lot of things so our expectations are that well be able to continue to do some improvements there but were really being careful i mean i think the team overall is really sensitive to the revenue challenge that were in so were taking a look at every position if somebody leaves or retires were asking ourselves whether that position needs to be replaced and really just asking everybody to question every dollar that they spend to be quite honest with you and again there are some discretionary incentive sort of type cost in there that are also affecting those dollars peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey thanks for taking my questions just as we think about loan growth as we move forward with the energy reduction capacity and kind of the obviously you have some momentum in houston but how should we think about loan growth as move forward thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc michael its hard to say on loan growth it seems like weve just been in the ppp business for the last two months although we had seen some growth and i think our pipeline as i mentioned was up somewhat in the third quarter going into the third quarter although thats some of that is deals that were pushed forward into that quarter if you look at the give me just one second i think that we could see some growth in the third but its really hard to ph get this built on what its going to be after that because we just dont know what kind cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 of activity businesses are going to undertake until they get some more visibility on the health issues so i think highsingle digits has always been our goal for loan growth im going to expect its going to be lower than that until we get some visibility on whats going happen medically and whats going on with the economy i wish i had a better answer for you but were still ph working on that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc completely understand were in challenging times phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc we are michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc as we think about the reserve at this point weve had a lot of banks talk about the heavy ph reserve going being done how do you guys think about that it looks like the reserve was down exppp how should we think about reserve levels at this point thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc michael i think what we did which doesnt surprise me its been my experience this is what we do we hit it really hard really early so if you look at the first quarter i mean we had million reserve we built the numbers up we had a much smaller amount in the second quarter really because of it but if you look at the first half of the year and look at the numbers that weve provided i think that we were representative of people who are doing their business the right way i feel good about that the question is going to be what happens going forward and thats just going to depend on the health situation i think and i think were going to see some increases in problems but how indiscernible i dont know how the cecl thing is going to play out i mean it is what it is that also creates uncertainty what the model are going to say what are the complications going to be i feel pretty good about where we are and about where our situation is with the reserve im not going to say it wont increase if things get worse and it also could we could see provisions go way down if the models and the situation indicates that things are continuing to improve so ph its kind of like longer but i wish i had a better answer but theres so much uncertainty right jerry any thoughts on cecl jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i mean i think you hit the nail on the head i think right now obviously we feel good about where were at a lot of it just depends on what the second half of the year looks like i think if things were to return take a turn for the worse obviously we did have expectations that if things would increase that that reserve would increase but right now we feel good about it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 a lot of work is done both on the commercial real estate side weve got the credit guys meeting with our relationship managers weekly just like they do on the energy portfolio so were trying to stay ahead of all of that but we cant really control what happens to the economy related to the pandemic effect if something happens there we could see some challenges phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc i think jerry made a really good point there that weve established i mean again its not our first rodeo and so we put in place counsels and energy counsel that reviews i think were reviewing basically of all the energy relationships on the production side to probably higher now on the service side meets every week it used to be for three hours its down to where its probably half that time now weve established a commercial real estate counsel as well thats doing the same thing on a weekly basis going through the credits the relationship managers are responsible for communicating with customers communicating back in terms of what theyre saying we need to understand the sustainability of their cash flow we need to understand their plans and the effectiveness theyre having on executing those plans theres just as tremendous amount of work being done communicating with customers and understanding our situation ill tell you though i sit in on those id like to monitor those as much as i can and im always encouraged ph going away from it just because of the ability of our customers to execute and their willingness to and our relationship managers their ability to understand and have these relationships with the customers ill tell you another thing that i feel good about just anecdotally is as you talk to people about credits and listen to people explain whats going on with their credits i sure am glad that we put as much focus as we do on guarantees and on structures on those deals it makes a big difference when youre ph reading that right up and you get to the end and its guaranteed and the people that are supporting it thats what i mean by its really important the decisions you make going into the crisis more so than what you do during the crisis because now were in it but i feel good about the way were handling the credits where our people are operating and i feel good about how our customers are performing again not that we wont have problems and not that they wont increase but i feel that we did a good job of handling things across indiscernible going into this michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc i appreciate the color just one last question so if i look at pretax preprovision earnings with a lower margin i mean when do you guys think that you will stabilize and i know you didnt give the fiscal eps guidance because the ranges are very wide at this point but i mean on a pretax preprovision basis i mean when do you think we kind of bottomed is it the next quarter or two and then you grow obviously i understand the investment in houston and everything thats going on at this point but just from a guide perspective i mean when do you think we hit the bottom thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc i think we hit the bottom indiscernible situation because we know that and businesses are able to move forward i mean thats really it i mean theres some political uncertainty because its an election here so we cant forget about that but i mean the big deal is covid and the impact on the economy and on people and thats it and so im telling so i dont know the answer to your question cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks for taking my question phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc absolutely operator your next question comes on the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a couple of followups the deferral numbers that you gave it sounds like you have billion left any reason to think that such a deferral request will be any different at second of the phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc jon we dont have any indication that it will be right now so now i mean im not saying it wont be but thats not something that weve seen a spike up from where it was i think its sort of going the same way jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc pipeline comments youve made quite a few but how does the pipeline compare say where you were at the end of the fourth quarter it seems to me like its an okay pipeline but maybe a little narrower than normal so just kind of thinking about where you were indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc you know if you look at versus a year ago i happen to have that handy so the pipeline the gross pipeline was up and thats not weighted and as ive mentioned its not on linked quarter basis but versus last year its up cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc is it fair youre talking about some construction projects is it narrower or is it starting to broaden out indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc if you look at the pipeline commercial and industrial is weaker and youd expect that its flat to down of the growth in the pipeline is in commercial real estate and also consumer and consumer real estate our consumer i havent really talked much but our consumer pipeline is up on a linked quarter basis its up from last year now those arent huge numbers that growth is about of what you see in the commercial or the commercial real estate side so thats a positive so is it narrower probably and right now its more oriented towards commercial real estate and in consumer real estate and were not going to see much pipeline in the energy space right because were moderating our exposure there as weve talked about for a long time jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc last one i have maybe more big picture but in an odd way it seems like this environment is actually good for you in terms of market share and business development maybe youre taking share just kind of curious what your approach is right now for calling on new business what kind of plan do you have in place for getting people back out in the field indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc you know right now were working on calls with zoom just a little clumsy as you know id take days out of the year and just call on customers and ive had i guess four maybe five days of that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc teams im sorry phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc sorry jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc teams you said zoom its teams indiscernible phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc zoom is kind of a generic name like ph bandaid and kleenex jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 sorry phillip d green a chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost bankers inc sorry teams microsoft teams thats right and theyre not terrible theyre a little awkward sometimes you have technology issues and all but youre still getting to see people were getting used to it but were kind of bumping our way along i think the thing that really gave us the biggest push was just ppp and you can say well ph how much is your ppp loans for customers how are you getting indiscernible customers if you didnt do their loans people are so frustrated with some of the experiences that they have had and we got a lot of good reputational word of mouth on the experience people have with us and its been great i mean our numbers of new relationships we report them every week and weve seen them grow from probably 30ish to 100ish a week for the last seven eight weeks and thats really notable and a big percentage of those are related to ppp so thats good i will say this its amazing to me how competitive it still is just to give you an example take commercial real estate funding we lost i gave you the total deals that we lost to structure but if you look at just cre so we lost in of the deals that we lost we lost at structure in this year of the deals weve lost weve lost a structure so its amazing to me that youre still seeing some aggressiveness in structure in this market so as far as the competitive situation it really hasnt cleared up yet but i think that we are this is kind of the time thats good for us we tend to be a stable force in terms of providing capital we dont move in and out too much we kind of stay in the middle and people know that about us our reputation on ppp has been great i think its really helped us out in houston where weve been growing so thats some good stuff i think theres some i agree with you theres some positives in this market for us taking share but theres a lot of work that weve got to do to get there and i will say one other thing which weve talked about i think its harder to move business over in this situation because people are just kind of hunkered down and so that may make that a little bit more difficult but thats the lay of the land right now competitively jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc that helps thanks guys operator and your final question comes from matt olney at stephens inc matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah thank you just wanted to followup on the investment securities portfolio the yields ticked a little bit higher in i was surprised and given your commentary around the upcoming maturities it sounds like youre saying that security deals should see a material decline i think in the back half of the year is that right and then if so how should we think about the magnitude of declines in security deals jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i havent really addressed the significance of the decline i dont know indiscernible coming off at what rate that improvement really between the first and the second quarter some of it was really we had some cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q2 earnings call 30jul2020 maturities of some tactical securities that were below or i guess we had a sale or two of some securities that were below the average yield so that kind of pumped up the yield in the second quarter compared to the first i think that obviously for anything thats maturing right now yeah its really difficult to find any sort of anything out there along the yield curve so its just going to be our guide just continuing to see what we can look at we will spend some of our liquidity i think i said we spent about million of it in the second quarter not a great rate there though at but were going to take a look at that and well probably spend a little bit more in the latter half of the year matt olney q analyst stephens inc jerry are there any large or chunky maturities that you see in the back of the year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i think that theyre all pretty ratable we did have a let me see if ive got the yield on this year i guess we had hold on a second bear with me let me get my notes here so i guess we had in the first quarter we had quite a bit of that we likely talked about maturity in sales ph on the treasuries portfolio in the second quarter really there wasnt that i dont have any sort of size associated with it i think we had really matched our sales and our purchases pretty evenly i think we had million maturing in the second quarter and replaced it with million the yield i saw on the munis for example about million of it was munis and that was coming off at about million so yes theres nowhere we can find anything like that right now but that million is really the only comparable i can give you that that matured in the second quarter matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator and there are no further questions in queue do you have any closing remarks phillip d green chairman chief executive officerdirector cullenfrost
