commercial and industrial total deposits were a record billion as of december an increase of billion or annualized from september fourth quarter average deposit growth was annualized growth was driven by time deposits reflecting a successful branchbased cd campaign during the fourth quarter our deposit book is welldiversified by deposit type and of total deposits were in noninterestbearing demand deposits as of december our loantodeposit ratio decreased to as of the end of the year from as of september turning to slide as you can see in the exhibit on this slide all our capital ratios expanded

commercial real estate loans were billion as of december up annualized from september and up yearoveryear in slide we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio which consists of single family mortgages and home equity lines of credit our residential mortgage loans are primarily originated through east west bank branches i would highlight that of our heloc commitments were in a firstlien position as of december residential mortgage loans totaled billion as of december up annualized from september and up yearoveryear i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start with our asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on slides and the asset quality of our portfolio continues to be stable and strong quarteroverquarter criticized loans decreased and the criticized loan ratio improved basis points both classified and special mention loans decreased from already low levels as of september at year end the nonperforming assets ratio was basis points of assets unchanged quarteroverquarter chargeoffs continue to be at low levels during the fourth quarter we recorded net chargeoffs of million or basis points compared with net chargeoffs of basis points in the third quarter our allowance totaled million as of december or of loans up from as of september during the fourth quarter we recorded a provision for credit losses of million compared with million for the third quarter while asset quality remained strong and the current credit environment is benign we continue to remain vigilant about credit were actively managing the loan portfolio and taking proactive measures to build our allowance for loan losses and now moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides of note amortization of tax credit and other investments in the fourth quarter was million compared with million in the third quarter at the same time the quarterly effective tax rate was in the fourth quarter compared with in the third quarter this fluctuation is due to tax credit investments that were closed in the fourth quarter and the related products that were placed into service this resulted in a lower effective tax rate and an increase in the amortization expense for the fourth quarter for the full year of the effective tax rate was ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slide through starting with average balance sheet as dominic mentioned in his remarks fourth quarter average loan growth at annualized was wellbalanced among our major loan portfolios an average deposit growth of annualized reflected a successful branchbased deposit campaign our average loantodeposit ratio was stable quarter overquarter at average noninterestbearing demand deposits made up of our average deposits in the fourth quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 turning to slide fourth quarter of net interest income of million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing linkedquarter annualized our net interest margin of expanded basis points quarteroverquarter as you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide net interest margin expansion in the fourth quarter reflected the impact of higher loan and earning asset yields which increased the net interest margin by basis points partially offset by basis points of compression from the funding side our net interest income growth benefited from rising benchmark interest rates because of indiscernible our assetsensitive loan portfolio to preserve net interest income when interest rates go down we added billion of swaps and collars in which included billion added early in the fourth quarter turning to slide the fourth quarter average loan yield was an increase of basis points quarterover quarter the average loan yield comprised an average coupon yield of plus yield adjustments which contributed basis points to the overall loan yield in the fourth quarter as of december the spot coupon rate of our loans was in this slide we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio for the last five quarter ends you can see the positive impact on rising interest rate on each of the loan portfolios as loans have repriced in total of our loan portfolio was variable rates including linked to the prime rate and linked to libor or sofr rates i would also highlight that over of our variable rate commercial real estate loans had customer level interest rate derivative contracts in place to clarify this is distinct from the balance sheet hedging i discussed a minute ago with the customer level derivative contracts weve helped our customers enter into lowlevel interest rate swaps collars and caps currently structured to help protect customers against rising debt service costs at the same time the loans remain variable rate on our balance sheet and the bank benefits from the asset sensitivity turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter was basis points up basis points from the third quarter our spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of december a yearoveryear increase of basis points this translates to a cumulative beta relative to the 425basispoint increase in the target fed funds rate over the same period in comparison the cumulative beta on our loan has been as our loan coupon spot rate increased basis points yearoveryear we started the rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength with historically high levels of demand deposits for east west bank and strong liquidity this has bolstered the asset sensitivity benefits of our variable rate loan portfolio supporting strong revenue growth through the cycle we are pleased with the lag in deposit beta cycle to date this has come through careful deposit cost management with a cumulative beta cycle to date we are outperforming prior rising interest rate cycles with of our average deposits and interestbearing accounts and with the growth that we have had in treasury management products and services since before the pandemic we feel comfortable about continuing to navigate the current cycle well moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the fourth quarter was down from in the third quarter customerdriven fee income and net gain until the loans were million down or annualized from the third quarter and up from a year ago yearoveryear we saw growth across most of our fee income lines of business east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 moving onto slide fourth quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the third quarter down quarteroverquarter or annualized driven by lower compensation and employee benefits expense once again we generated strong positive operating leverage with total revenue growth of annualized in the fourth quarter plus a sequential decrease in expenses the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared to in the third quarter our adjusted pretax preprovision income grew linked quarter annualized and our pretax preprovision roa was an attractive in the fourth quarter and with that ill now review our updated outlook for the full year of on slide for the fullyear compared to we currently expect yearoveryear loan growth in the highsingle digit percentage range we expect production from all of our major loan portfolios in yearoveryear we expect net interest income growth in the low20 rate range underpinning our interest income assumptions is the forward interest rate curve as of yearend which assumes a peak fed funds target rate of by april and the yearend fed funds target rate of with the cut late in the year in our modeling we assume that deposit betas will continue to rise in adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization in the range of to we expect our revenue and expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage yearoveryear in terms of credit for the provision for credit losses will largely be driven by changes in the macroeconomic outlook we are providing our expectations for gross chargeoffs which are expected to be in line with our recent gross chargeoff experience if macroeconomic conditions stay stable for context the gross chargeoff ratio was basis points in and basis points in asset quality to date is excellent and the potential losses from any problem loans are limited however realistically as the economic backdrop weakens we would expect to see some credit normalization from the very low levels to date in terms of tax items we currently expect that approximately million of tax credit investments excluding low income housing tax credits will close and go into service in and therefore be part of our tax rate calculation for the full year the tax credit amortization related to these tax credits should be approximately of the tax credit investment amount for the full year for the first quarter of we expect that million of these tax credits will be reflected in the tax rate calculation the tax credit amortization to be approximately million for the quarter there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate and the tax credit amortization due to the timing of tax credit investments placed into service with that ill now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing was an excellent year for east west with our highestever earnings revenue loans and deposits and the achievement of industryleading profitability metrics our annual earnings now exceed billion we look forward to with excitement as we celebrate our 50year anniversary the bank and our customers have come a long way since throughout our history the pillar of our success has been and continues to be our spirit of going above and beyond to service our customers east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 we are honored to be the bank of choice for our clients and wish to thank all our associates for their dedication and contribution to making our bank a success lastly i want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a happy lunar new year may the year of the rabbit bring health prosperity and happiness to all of us i will now open up the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys nice quarter dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you dave irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning dave thank you david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc sure my first question is on the nii guide on slide you guys highlight the total deposit beta of you got interestbearing deposit beta through the end of last year i was wondering what deposit beta youre baking into the guide at this point i know you mentioned you expected deposit beta to rise through this year but are you thinking mid or upper to the overall cycle or are you baking at something higher than that and then how do you think about deposit growth from here and what that means for borrowing levels which are still very low thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question dave at this point in time were modeling the fullcycle beta will be for and at the same time for interestbearing deposits the deposit beta of and thats factored in with our nii guidance that we have of the increase in the low20 overall i think with the good growth that weve had in deposits in general along with our successful campaigns for cds that are lower than others competitors in the market at this point in time i think well be able to continue to fund our loan growth with the deposits certainly though were very opportunistic and look at that from the perspective of cost east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then just one follow up on the back end of the year when you with your fed rate cut was curious what youre expecting for the deposit cost movement as a result of that cut are you thinking that youll get immediate benefit or are you thinking there might be a little bit of a lag there with the first couple cuts thanks again irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think its so late in the year at this point the expectation around that were not baking that in dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks operator the next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask on the hedges that youve been putting on the books can you speak to how those might impact loan betas for both the remaining of the rate cycle the rate hike cycle and also when the fed begins cutting rates and also how much more you plan to do on your hedging efforts from here irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question certainly the specifics of how much thats impacted us quartertodate i do not have that but we can get that information after the call certainly as we started adding this fourth quarter third quarter there was a little bit of impact as far as the largely against the cre loans that weve kind of hedged we have billion of swaps and also collars that weve put on at this point in time in discussion with our alco committee theres probably another couple billion that we would look to do but certainly were opportunistic about this and also evaluating the overall balance sheet and the positioning of that so thats something that well continue to evaluate to see what we think makes the most sense given the changes in the interest rate environment as well manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 got it and is there a bottom we can think about on nim in the event that the fed begins cutting or is that too early to say right now irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i think its too early to say ph yeah too early to say manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay fair enough and then in just on credit in november you emphasized like everyone else youve been watchful for a normalization on credit and youre focused on early detection of any cracks in the reviews that youve been making have there been any covenant breaches or any other cracks to note irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i mean i think certainly on an individual loan basis that is happening right but overall i think were very positive from the perspective that on credit as we do continue to do these reviews on our commercial books our consumer books throughout whats positive is there are not a lot of new problem loans same loans that we were working through last couple years continue to be things that we work through but not a lot of new problems in that process so thats certainly something that we feel is positive and positions us well dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah weve been actively managing the loan portfolio overall so as you can see in the criticized asset percentage its relatively benign so so far surprisingly asset quality is very very good and we look at the rising interest rate obviously thats why weve been aggressively managing the portfolio and see how it goes and i always do this ongoing loan review and so far so good operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning i guess maybe just sticking with asset quality so appreciate that what you just said dominic you havent seen any stress within the portfolio but is that a timing issue or when in your slide youre showing how interest rates yields have gone up on these loan portfolios is it timing issue or do you feel good about the loan book and your ability of these borrowers to absorb where if the fed funds were to peak out at they should be able to handle this where it doesnt become a credit issue for east west like do you feel good about that do you have visibility into that dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well when it comes when you say timing issue we obviously when we do our stress tests on these real estate we are obviously projecting so its not something that we just are looking at it as of today whether they can handle and so forth so from that perspective we feel pretty good about the liquidity level of our clients in terms of the cash flow that theyve been getting from the existing business east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 so i guess in a way that what we notice is that the cash flow is still pretty good i think its really coming back down to the economy the economy is too strong now if you looked at it we project a much more deteriorating economy that would be very different at this point we dont see it things are going pretty well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just separately in terms of loan growth so appreciate the lower growth guidance but just talk to us in terms of what are the pockets i know irene mentioned you expect loan growth across categories but any particular verticals any markets where youre seeing more strength and more market share opportunities as we think growth and maybe potential for upside surprise on that growth dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think overall we have always been very focused in having a more diversified growth so from that standpoint theres always going to be one particular industry vertical here and there that seems to do a bit better than the others however overall if it get too far we reign it in anyway so in that standpoint thats why you always see a much more even kill more a diverse type of loan portfolio that we have here is because we actually manage it so but i would say that i mean at just looking at maybe a couple of weeks so far we do have a few more like private equity capital call line commitments that we have originated but i would expect that if it continues to go in that direction we probably have a stronger pe loan growth and then also last year that we actually have surprisingly pretty decent growth from our greater china region and so despite the pandemic and so we expected that they may be able to continue to do quite well now obviously they have a much smaller balance sheet but as a percentage growth they are doing pretty well so we may have a few other different areas that well be able to stepup because we also have a very strong competitive teams within the organization everybody wanted to do better so well just expect that different team will stepup in different quarter operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey so i wanted to kind of touch again on the nii guide and in particular your outlook for the trajectory in net interest margin it appears if the margin stays flat from levels you could potentially hit the guidance just from that but im curious what your assumptions are as far as the trajectory in nim going through the year and also your with the forward rate curve assumptions east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think at this point my focus is really more on the nii brandon we do expect when we look at our guidance you can tell and you can do the math of my guidance as well that we do expect the nii to grow from the fourth quarter level then it depends really more about the fluctuation or what happens per quarter but both we expect to be positive in brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then in regards to your outlook for deposit growth what areas or what categories of deposits do you see most of that growth coming from and could you talk more about your ability to kind of mitigate losses in dda irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question when we look at our deposit portfolio and our customers one of the things that we benefit from is just the diversity of customers we have certainly in order to quite candidly remain competitive we had these deposit cd campaigns in the fourth quarter and we have one right now price below market but attractive enough rate and also sixmonth duration we dont want that to go too long and so that is something that we continue to do relative to other kind of funding costs right now we think its attractive its also a customer base that stays with us and has a larger relationship with us when we look out for and where we think deposits are going to grow id say across the board although realistically in this kind of rate environment its hard to maintain the deposit balances in the dda accounts at the level that we have prerising rates we are still onboarding new customers all the time pipelines are strong on the deposit side so we are very kind of positive about what were doing the investments that we made in treasury management cash management products services certainly are something that were seeing a benefit today dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i wanted to highlight also i think at the height of excess liquidity which is during ppp time back in late because of covid we had like maybe it went all the way up to close to as a percentage of dda to the noninterestbearing deposit to the entire deposit portfolio today were down to so as you can see there was a lot of liquidity then but by nature even without interest rate rising and so forth you expect that the success of liquidity would not be sustainable so we are actually very very pleased throughout the last few quarters watching our noninterestbearing deposit and see what the percent you send and just kind of each quarter drop 1basispoint and so forth and then so far so good so we drop now to its still thats a lot of noninterestbearing deposits sitting there and on by the way the other part is that we continue to bring in new customers we continue to bring new commercial customers were still onboarding this new relationship one at a time so in time it will continue to grow the noninterestbearing deposits its just that there are some excess liquidity that in relationship what the market rate in terms of deposit it is today naturally there are people who are moving some of the maybe excess liquidity they put into whether money market accounts or maybe cds account and so forth east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 so thats why you see that there is a some gradual reduction on noninterestbearing deposit balance but in terms of number of accounts it keeps going up operator the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys just wanted to follow up on the loan growth outlook i was wondering how what you guys were assuming for utilization rates in your guide and then any color on how loan pipelines are shaping up versus irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc at this point in time were not assuming a change in utilization rates casey were assuming flat from where were at casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and then on the credit quality side everythings still pretty benign and holding stable i was wondering is that true also for the billion exposure in china which obviously gets a lot of attention from investors dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc china is even better so weve always have a very very strong pristine loan portfolio and so its still exactly the same so we feel that with the economy opening up i think it would only going to help us better while we dont expect that there will be some sudden surge of loan origination in because while the economy opened up its going to still take a little bit time for the business to sort of get back on track it will probably benefit us more in than operator the next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead clark wright q analyst d a davidson co hi good morning this is clark wright on for gary tenner i dont want to beat a dead horse but just in terms of the loan growth again are you expecting it to be frontend loaded or forward indiscernible the quarters irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc were assuming that it isnt frontend loaded that will be throughout maybe a little bit more in the latter half of the year clark wright q analyst d a davidson co got it and the rest of my questions have been answered thank you and great quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning dominic on capital i think the dividend was a pretty strong signal given how much capital you have and the position youre in is that really the only capital return that youre contemplating right now given the economy i know youve been resistant to the buyback but i just want to see if theres any change in tone there irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i just want to interject we have not been resistant to the buyback we bought back a million last year dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah we did million in the second quarter of we still have million outstanding that we can execute any time we want because has been approved by the board last year and we are very opportunistic in terms of the buyback you have to look at is that fourth quarter we just racked up return on tangible equity so we obviously its not one of those banks that really need to do this however we are always shareholders friendly so if we ever see that there is great opportunity we absolutely will use the capital at the right moment i thought what we did in the second quarter for the million was a quick execution because at that time with that price sure i would jump that right at it so but we have to be also be mindful one of the great advantage of east west bank if you look at our capital ratio today in this very kind of somewhat benign economic environment and we because of the and because of the interest rates that we are doing extraordinarily well from a return on equity and return on assets standpoint however had this been a completely different economic situation had it been like a unemployment rate interest rate were in a much higher level that business were having trouble we at that point having this kind of capital would absolutely give our customers much stronger confidence about why they wanted to be banking with east west than the others so i was always mindful of that this has been doing really really well for us back in and during global financial crisis somehow somewhere we just have a bit more capital than our peers and so ultimately customers just feel more comfortable with us so weve always been very mindful of that so thats one key reason the other thing is that we dont want to not have some excess capital just in case that there are even potential acquisition opportunity and so forth so we are very choosy in terms of potential acquisition however if there is something available were always ready to execute so all of that is a combination of multiple factors that caused east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 us to be where we are today and but one way or the other we are very comfortable with where we are and if were ever in a situation that we feel that the stock price or whatever the other reason that we feel or maybe somehow theres not enough of a confidence of growth that we may want to do some buyback we absolutely will step in well do the right thing so you can count on that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thank you for that perspective thanks dominic just i do want to ask the tax rate im not the tax expert but i want to make sure i understand the cadence of the amortization so irene you said roughly of the million will flow through the am line thats like a little over million and i think the q1 is a little over million can you help us with the tax rate because it looks like amortization last year was a decent amount lower and the tax rate was so im coming to a tax rate kind of mid to upperteens based on this guidance i just want to make sure i dont make a mistake thank you julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc hi chris this is julianna in terms of the tax rate it will vary depending on your assumptions for pretax income which will vary with your assumptions for provision for credit costs obviously in terms of the tax amortization on a fullyear basis when you look at that million of tax credits think of it as a of that will go into the tax credit amortization however we booked amortization when the credits close and go into service therefore for whats on the docket for the first quarter thats million that means amortization rate in quarters two three and four will be higher in order to come up into that fullyear number as credits close and go into service so we wrote in the slide deck that for the first quarter million of tax credits will be in the tax rate calculation and that will go on up through the year and i can follow up with you offline for a more detailed calculation if you like operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess when you look at the moves youve made with swaps and collars and the potential to add more is your goal to get to sort of eliminate all that asset sensitivity earlier or much of that asset sensitivity earlier in or how should we be thinking about just your general asset sensitivity positioning over the first few quarters east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question i would say that that isnt our goal jared to remove our asset sensitivity what we want to make sure is that when we look at the balance sheet and the loan portfolio that we are able to evaluate what we think as might happen hedge kind of risks that we see from interest rate perspective but we still expect to be assetsensitive even with these changes that were making jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then my followup any outlook on the fee income lines and what youre seeing in terms of potential for growth there among the different lines irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question on the fee income i would say the areas that are if you break that down as far as things that are within our control things that have to do with investments that weve made growth that we see with our customers thats going great market kind of driven factors things that maybe we dont have a control over i think thats going to continue to be challenging especially if you look at it from the perspective of marktomarket on derivatives and then also fx and that bounces around but aside from that we expect that from a core customer perspective and the growth perspective well still see those increases operator the next question is a followup from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey thank you i guess i just wanted to follow up on china in terms of one given the reopening thats underway in china does that create maybe stronger growth opportunities as we think about this year and how are you thinking about allocating more capital to that business and i appreciate a lot of the business is kind of cross border and theres crossborder connectivity but would love to hear if there are increased growth opportunities emerging in china and also dominic would love to hear your views as youre now the chair of apec like how do you see that relationship evolving and creating more opportunity for the bank given its strategic positioning thank you dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc in terms of the opening of china its not just a like a sort of like a postpandemic opening at the ability to travel in and out of china and so to help the foreign investments to add ease about not having the restriction to do quarantine and so forth but thats actually a baked factor because many of our management team have not been back to china for the last two or three years and so i think that likewise the same thing for many of the business who around the world who are doing business in china and they were restricted by that and then with this opening up i think thats a huge factor that helps substantially thats one the second part is really the chinese government new policy towards business obviously the last two or three years the business sectors were having some hard time whether youre in a social media high tech video gaming entertainment real estate education you name it every one of these sectors were hammered because east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 of a much more challenging policy or with or a regulation that came up that hindered their ability to grow now just for the last few weeks things turned in a completely different direction government are providing support to the real estate sectors they are also really getting much more businessfriendly to these other industries et cetera and so with that we also see that foreign investments are getting their license approved and getting their lets say additional investment to get majority shares also signoff and so forth so we do see that at this stage the business opportunity is much better now then reflected on east west bank we have always traditionally been mainly focusing on crossborder business and so i think that with this additional opening up and the more businessfriendly kind of policies clearly it would encourage crossborder business please keep in mind that despite the from the us side that we can see that maybe that attitude towards china has not improved but on the other hand we ought to keep in mind is that the business have been restricted and usually related to national security issues the highly sensitive or maybe some very very highlevel technology or biotech type of business that quite frankly that east west really do not have anything to do with and our focus is on these very very common like electronics garments and business items that importexport all investment to both shores that to the consumer market and et cetera that are not related to national security issue so we do feel that there are plenty of room to grow even during the pandemic when china literally was shut down against by the borders we still find way to grow our loans we still bring in additional new customers so we expect that to continue to grow but i dont think that east west will be an organization that just because of this new opening that we will just rapidly trying to push a lot of capital in there and were going to continue to stay steady and well continue to be observing the market and make sure we make the wise choice but i expect that in terms of a sustainable growth opportunity in the greater china region and also particularly as you mentioned throughout asia we feel pretty confident that that will be something that we expect to have a good opportunity going forward because the chinese business also have expanded into southeast asia what is it vietnam thailand indonesia malaysia et cetera so we expect that many of our customers who continue to migrate their business into those regions which will be beneficial to us and thats also the reason why we open the rep office in singapore so we will continue to evolve and expand into asia and to make sure that we can effectively roll this business model as the bridge between the east and the west ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch that is helpful thank you so much
