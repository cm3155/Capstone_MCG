quarter results and then update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with some first quarter highlights our solid results reflect the progress were making to improve and diversify our financial performance and the continued strength in the us economy its gratifying to see the investments were making across the franchise contributing to higher revenue versus the fourth quarter as an increase in noninterest income more than offset an expected decline in net interest income noninterest income also benefited from higher equity markets which benefited our wealth and investment management business net chargeoffs were higher than a year ago as expected and stable from the fourth quarter credit trends remain generally consistent consumer delinquencies continue to perform as weve forecasted and yearoveryear growth in consumer spend remains consistent with prior quarters in our commercial portfolios the weakness we see continues to be in certain commercial office properties but our expectations have not significantly changed versus what we anticipated last quarter mike will discuss the specific items that drove an increase in expenses from a year ago but we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives including reducing head count which has declined every quarter since the third quarter of wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the fourth quarter as higher rates are impacting demand and we are continuing to reduce our exposure in certain portfolios average deposits were relatively stable from the fourth quarter as growth in interestbearing deposits offset lower noninterestbearing deposits our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority as we stated on our last earnings call we expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in in the first quarter we repurchased a total of billion in common stock and our average common shares outstanding declined from a year ago now let me update you on the progress were making on our strategic priorities starting with our risk and control work earlier this year the occ terminated a consent order it issued in regarding sales practices misconduct the closure of this order was an important milestone as it is confirmation that we operate much differently today around sales practices as i repeatedly said our risk and control work remains our top priority and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress this is the sixth consent order that our regulators have terminated since i joined wells fargo in building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort and as we implement changes we track effectiveness along the way the numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment and we see that we are completing interim deliverables but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete so it will remain our top priority and our approach will not change as i highlighted in my recent annual letter we had added approximately people across numerous risk and control related groups and were spending over billion more per year than in these areas and we are a stronger better company for our customers communities and employees while were moving forward with confidence i will repeat what ive said in the past regulatory pressures on banks longstanding issues such as ours is high and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators we remain at risk of further regulatory actions additionally as we implement heightened controls and oversight new issues could be found and these may result in regulatory actions at the same time were making progress on our risk and control work were executing on our strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time we continue to introduce attractive new products as we build our credit card business last month we launched autograph journey designed for frequent travellers who could earn points wherever they book travel our new product offerings continued to drive strong credit card spend up approximately billion or from a year ago we continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen corporate and investment banking more than new senior hires have joined our cib since with many of these in key coverage and product groups within banking in february doug braunstein who has more than years of industry experience joined wells fargo as vice chairman doug is a worldclass banker and hes working alongside the great team hes assembled to continue to grow the franchise in addition given the breadth of dougs experience hes also providing counsel on broader business issues beyond client development as we look forward its always helpful to be grounded in the facts we continue to see strength in the us economy spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow yearoveryear consumer credit is performing as we expect wholesale credit continues to perform well and our views around commercial real estate have not significantly changed since last quarter these are all positives wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 in addition we remain committed and confident in our ability to increase efficiencies across the enterprise and areas weve have targeted for investments such as credit card investment banking and trading are performing well were beginning to see early signs of share and fee growth which will be important as we diversify our revenues and reduce net interest income as a percentage of revenue and we remain bullish on opportunities across our other businesses again more positives having said that markets and rates will likely remain volatile and as risk managers we are prepared if trends were to change weve historically managed credit through multiple cycles and believe that the actions weve taken over the last several years position us well we have strong capital and liquidity positions as were building many of our businesses we have done so within a consistent level of risk appetite and our business model and franchise value differentiates us from most of who we compete with regardless of the environment so what does all of this mean for our outlook simply said our views havent changed from last quarter while we could look at specific data points on a specific date and alter our guidance there is not enough of a consistent fact pattern to change our views but what we see is helpful our focus remains the same we are transforming wells fargo and are investing to build a wellcontrolled bestgrowing and higherreturning company while we work to become more efficient im pleased with the progress weve made and im optimistic about the future opportunities ahead i will now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the first quarter was billion or per diluted common share our first quarter results included million or per share for the fdic special assessment as a result of the regional bank failures last year recall last quarter our results included billion for the special assessment and this additional amount reflects recent updates provided by the fdic including potential recoveries which were highlighted in their disclosure the ultimate amount of our special assessment may continue to change as the fdic determines the actual losses and recoveries to the deposit insurance fund turning to slide net interest income declined billion or from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs including the impact of customers migrating to higheryielding deposit products as well as lower loan balances partially offset by higher yields on earning assets first quarter results were largely as expected with loan balances a little lower and deposit balances in the businesses a little higher than our expectations our full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter and we still expect net interest income to be approximately to lower than we also continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of this year it is still early in the year and ultimately the amount of net interest income we earn will depend on a variety of factors many of which are uncertain including deposit balances mix and pricing the absolute level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve and loan demand on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans were down from both the fourth quarter and a year ago credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined ill highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago to over reflecting the higher interest rate environment wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 average deposits declined from a year ago reflecting lower deposits in our consumer businesses as customers continued spending and reallocating cash into higheryielding alternatives while growth in average deposits from the fourth quarter was modest we have grown deposits in our commercial businesses for two consecutive quarters which reflected our success in attracting clients operational deposits periodend deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up from the fourth quarter but some of this growth reflected a temporary increase driven by a quarterend that was on payday and a holiday while the pace of growth slowed our average deposit costs continued to increase as expected rising basis points from the fourth quarter to basis points with higher deposit costs across most operating segments our mix of deposits continue to shift with our percentage of noninterestbearing deposits declining to turning to noninterest income on slide we were pleased with the growth in noninterest income across all of our business segments growth in noninterest income more than offset lower net interest income reflecting a revenue growth from both the fourth quarter and a year ago noninterest income was up from a year ago with strong growth in investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions deposit and lendingrelated fees trading and investment banking fees as charlie highlighted we benefited from market conditions as well as the investments weve been making in our businesses i will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing the segment results turning to expenses on slide first quarter noninterest expense increased from a year ago driven by higher operating losses the fdic special assessment an increase in revenuerelated compensation predominantly due to higher investment and advisory fees in our wealth and investment management business and higher technology and equipment expense these increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives including lower professional and outside services expense which declined from a year ago the higher operating losses were driven by customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us the increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter including payroll taxes restricted stock expense for retirementeligible employees and 401k matching contributions not including expense for the fdic special assessment in the first quarter our full year noninterest expense guidance is unchanged and is still expected to be approximately billion however we continue to watch a couple of items our guidance included billion of operating losses for the year which we still believe is a reasonable estimate even with a higher level of operating losses in the first quarter however we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year also if market valuations remain at current levels or move higher that would increase investment in advisory fees and revenuerelated compensation could be higher than we assumed in our expense guidance for this year which would be a good thing well continue to update you as the year progresses turning to credit quality on slide net loan chargeoffs declined basis points from the fourth quarter to basis points of average loans credit performance trends were consistent with what we saw last quarter the decline reflected lower commercial net loan chargeoffs which were down million from the fourth quarter to basis points of average loans the reduction was driven by lower losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio we did not see further deterioration in the performance of our cre office portfolio versus the fourth quarter and therefore our expectations have not changed we continue to expect additional losses in the coming quarters however the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 consumer net loan chargeoffs continue to increase as expected and were up million from the fourth quarter to basis points of average loans while auto losses continue to decline benefiting from the tightening actions we implemented starting in late credit card losses increased in line with our expectations nonperforming assets declined from the fourth quarter driven by the lower cre office nonaccruals reflecting the realization of losses and paydowns in the quarter moving to slide based on the consistent credit trends i noted before our allowance for credit losses was down modestly driven by declines for commercial real estate and auto loans partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans the table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate including the breakdown of the office portfolio we didnt increase our allowance for this portfolio in the first quarter and the coverage ratio in our cib commercial real estate office portfolio of was stable compared with the fourth quarter turning to capital and liquidity on slide our capital position remains strong and our cet1 ratio of continue to be well above our regulatory minimum plus buffers we repurchased billion of common stock in the first quarter while the amount of stock we repurchase each quarter will vary we continue to expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer small and business banking revenue declined from a year ago driven by our lower deposit balances we continue to invest in talent technology and branches to improve the customer experience our branches are becoming more advicefocused with teller transactions declining while banker visits have increased we are modernizing and optimizing the branch network the number of branches declined from a year ago while at the same time we are accelerating the refurbishment of our branch network in addition the enhancements we are making to our mobile app continue to drive momentum in mobile adoption and we surpassed million active mobile customers in the first quarter up from a year ago mobile logins also reached a milestone surpassing billion logins for the first time in the first quarter up from a year ago home lending revenue was stable from a year ago as higher mortgage banking income was offset by lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline credit card revenue increased from a year ago driven by the higher loan balances payment rates remained relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter and were above prepandemic levels auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances personal lending revenue was up from a year ago and included the impact of higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide retail mortgage originations declined from a year ago reflecting the progress weve made on our strategic objective to simplify the business as well as the decline in the mortgage market we also made significant progress in reducing the amount of thirdparty mortgage loans we service down from a year ago we also continued to reduce the head count in home lending which was down from a year ago balances in our auto portfolio were down compared to last year originations volume declined from a year ago reflecting credit tightening actions but increased from a slow fourth quarter debit card spend increased from a year ago with growth in most categories except for fuel and travel credit card spending wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 remained strong and was up from a year ago all categories grew with stronger growth in nondiscretionary spend new account growth continued to be strong up from last year turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue was down from a year ago driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs partially offset by higher depositrelated fees assetbased lending and leasing revenue decreased yearoveryear and included lower revenue from equity investments average loan balances were stable compared to a year ago as growth in assetbased lending and leasing was offset by declines in middle market banking weaker loan demand reflected the impact of clients being cautious given the higher rate environment and the anticipation of lower rates this year as well as some potential uncertainty in an election year turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher investment banking revenues due to increased activity across all products our results benefited from the areas where we have had strength for some time such as investmentgrade debt capital markets and from the talent weve been attracting into the business while its still early we are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing commercial real estate revenue was down from a year ago and included the impact of lower loan balances markets revenue increased from a year ago driven by continued strong performance in structured products credit products and foreign exchange our trading results continue to benefit from market conditions and the investments we have made in technology and talent to round out the business have enabled us to produce strong results even as market dynamics have changed average loans declined from a year ago banking clients have taken advantage of strong capital markets payout loans in addition to weak loan demand in commercial real estate given market conditions balances also declined due to credit tightening actions we implemented last year along with our efforts to actively reduce certain property types in the portfolio on slide wealth and investment management revenue increased compared to a year ago lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers reallocated cash into higheryielding alternatives was more than offset by higher assetbased fees due to increased market valuations while cash alternatives as a percentage of total client assets was higher than a year ago it has declined in the past two quarters as the migration of deposits into cash alternatives has slowed significantly as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so first quarter results reflected market valuations as of january which were higher from a year ago assetbased fees in the second quarter will reflect market valuations as of april which were higher from both a year ago and from january slide highlights our corporate results revenues grew from a year ago due to improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments in summary our results in the first quarter reflected the progress were making to improve our financial performance we grew revenue driven by strong growth in our feebased businesses we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives we increased capital return to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position well now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question will come from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open sir john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning guys wanted to ask about your profitability targets and kind of how youre seeing the journey to the midteens rotce goal and mike maybe you could talk about that through the lens of return on tangible common equity this quarter where do you think youre kind of overearning underearning and what does that journey to the midteens look like over the next couple of years michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey john its mike thanks for the question so look i think not much has changed in our thinking on the topic and so as you sort of think about it on a longterm basis theres still no reason why our businesses shouldnt have returns like the best of our peers and as we sort of go through that journey obviously we are where we are in terms of the returns today and as we get towards closer to its going to be the same kinds of drivers that weve been talking about now for a while weve got to continue to optimize sort of capital and balance sheet you saw us return some via buybacks today were making investments on each of our businesses and so well need to start seeing some of the returns there and this was one quarter of it but a good quarter that shows some of the benefits of those investments were making across a whole range of the businesses which is good to see and charlie highlighted a bunch of that in his commentary and then weve got to stay on the efficiency journey which we continue to believe is not done and weve got a lot of work to do to continue to drive efficiency across the company and were going to stay at that as we look forward and so i think its really those drivers that get in and we still have confidence that were going to get there charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey john its charlie let me just add a couple of things number one is just as a reminder to everyone weve tried to be clear where as nii was rising and we got to certainly either at the peak or near the peaks that we were out earning and that we didnt look at those roes at those points as sustainable but that our clear journey was to continue to get there on a sustainable basis i think second of all when we look at obviously its very hard to draw any conclusion from a specific quarter right weve got the fdic weve got operating losses which weve talked about where our expectations are for the full year which are different than the quarter so its very hard to draw a conclusion on a specific quarter but when we look at what is going to get us there we are very consistent on what those things are number one is improved business performance and we tried to highlight where we see that and those areas that we dont talk about are areas that we are still bullish on but would like to see some more improvement in the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 ability to increase our returns in those parts of the company as well as continued capital return as well as the limitations we have because of the asset gap so again our thesis hasnt changed our views hasnt changed and our confidence in getting there hasnt changed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then one just quick followup there do you think this cet1 is probably kind of the ballpark of where you hang out regardless of the minimum just because it feels like you have super regional banks that arent gsibs that are running at you have bigger banks at so kind of feel like the right ballpark which means you can return most of what youre generating now charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i would say its something that we continue to think through you know our existing needs today with buffers are at at everyone understands that basel iii endgame is coming but likely with significant revisions so i think as the quarters continue well learn more about where that will come out and well be able to be more informed about where well wind up weve always tried to be on the more conservative end but theres a point at which too much is too much which is why we bought the amount this quarter that we bought back john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you operator the next question will come from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open sir ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just following up on that as we think about basel your capital levels even with basis points buffer you probably have billion of excess capital given what we saw in and i heard you mike yearoveryear youre going to be higher but that doesnt give enough color im just wondering should we expect the pace of buybacks to continue given that where the stocks trading which is still fairly attractive valuations michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its mike thanks for the question as you look at the pacing were really not going to provide specific guidance on like what well do quartertoquarter i think obviously as youve pointed out weve got significant excess capital to where we need to be well be able to handle with whatever comes out of basel iii quite easily with where we are today gives us the ability to be there and invest as weve got opportunities with clients and so weve got lots of flexibility and each quarter well go through the same process we go through every quarter which is thinking about sort of where the capital requirements are going to go looking at all the different risks that are out there across the spectrum whether its rates or other and then looking at what were seeing from a client activity and then well make a decision on the pacing of it but as you say were still very confident well do more than we did last year but pacing will kind of leave to well cover that each quarter after we report wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just separately i think theres a lot of focus on market share opportunity for wells beating capital markets ib corporate lending and i think charlie referenced the hiring of doug braunstein would appreciate additional color in terms of areas where you see within corporate capital markets where theres market share to be had and whats the level of investmentinfrastructure needed in order for competing in that space and winning market share charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah let me start out i think first of all when we talk about the level of investment thats necessary were making the investment and its embedded in what were spending and so we are funding that through normal course of business some of the folks that were hiring or replacing other people and others are additions but thats part of what it is and so we dont anticipate any kind of step up in the expense base to fund what were doing which we feel great about weve got the ability to spend along the way and to actually see them paying off for itself and listen i said this very consistently which is we are extremely underpenetrated across almost all segments of the investment banking space but weve been stronger on the debt side we have not been as strong on the equity side and by the way all for reasons that relate to our own willingness to invest over the last decades not because of the opportunity or because of our business model its just the opposite its just not something that the senior management team here was supportive of and we feel very differently than that and so when we look across coverage in the equity space by industry on the strategic side and how that relates to our the existing highquality debt platform that we have again were prioritizing industries based upon where we already have strength and relationship and where there are significant wallets but we feel really great about our ability to serve a broad set of customers and their desire to do business with us because of both the platform and the talent that we have here and then when we look at our you know the trading side of our business a big part of what we do there is to support our efforts within the investment bank but it also is to leverage the broader institutional relationships that we have where we do a lot with those institutions but we havent necessarily leveraged trading flow as part of that and so to do that were making investments not just in people but in technology as i alluded to were not doing any of this by rethinking the way we think of our risk tolerances it really is about getting the right products the right services the right people and calling on our customer base with a different degree of credibility and desire that weve had in the past ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc very good color thank you operator the next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open sir ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 thank you good morning im wondering if we could talk a little bit about just that kind of last mile of deposit repricing you talked about the mix shift and noninterest down and interestbearing up but just wondering just whats happening on the pricing side and are you still seeing both sides consumer and wholesale if you can maybe just kind of give us the dynamics thats happening underneath and how you expect that to continue as we get to this as we stay in this rates peak thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure ill take that ken as you look at the commercial side not much has changed its pretty competitive were not seeing it move one way or the other in a significant way as you sort of look over the last quarter good news is weve been able to attract good operating deposits in the corporate investment bank weve seen some growth in the commercial bank as well and so all thats kind of performing as youd expect and you wouldnt really expect pricing to move there until the fed starts to move it will stay pretty competitive at that point and we still expect betas to be pretty high on the way down as you start to see that eventually happen on the consumer side standard pricing is not moving and really what youre seeing is youre seeing people continue to spend some of the money thats in their checking accounts andor move some of it into either cds or higheryielding savings accounts and so you still see some of that activity happening across the consumer space and the wealth space where you still have some people moving into higheryielding alternatives the pace of that migration has slowed at least for now and so well see how that progresses through the rest of the year but it has slowed a bit over the last number of months ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and on the lending side i think what you guys showed is not unexpected at all based on general softness to start the year and so i think you and others should just kind of generically hope that we get an improvement but with rates where they are is there any impediment to just seeing an improvement in loan growth as the year goes on or is it baked into kind of the demand function that youre seeing underneath michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think what were seeing so far is exactly what we expected to see at the beginning of the year and i know that different people have different views back in january but this is exactly what we expected which is pretty low demand now as i said in my commentary its a little bit lower than what we had modelled but not substantially at this point and it really is a demand function when you look at what were hearing from clients in the commercial bank or some of the clients in the corporate investment bank theyre being cautious still and saying okay im not going to build inventories as much as i might in a different environment theyre being thoughtful about the cost of credit and how that impacts investments theyre making or the timing and the pacing of that and so on the commercial side it really is a demand issue at this point on the consumer side you continue to see some growth in card balances given the size of the balance sheet thats not going to move the whole balance sheet very materially given where we start from and then the mortgage side just continues to decline a little bit given the market that weve got there and in auto were seeing a little bit more decline given some of the changes we made about about a year and a half ago a year year and wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 a half ago on some of the credit tightening and eventually that will start to turn so i think those are the dynamics that were seeing right now ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks mike michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah operator the next question will come from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey okay a couple of just quickies here one is on the net interest income outlook thats unchanged could you remind us what the interest rate environment is thats the base case for that analysis michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure hey its mike betsy welcome back betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure when you look at the environment were not guessing that sort of whats going to happen right so i think as you sort of look at the different variables there embedded in our baseline forecast is that we would expect somewhere around three rate cuts this year and thats whats underlying sort of our thinking at this point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and was that the same as last quarter same assumption set or is that changed wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co no i mean yeah no look its definitely less than what i think was being projected by the market and thats what we put out on our slide in january and when you look at the impact of that in isolation you certainly would see a benefit from less rate cuts but i do think you have to put that in the context of okay now whats going to happen with client behavior and mix shifts as we look for the rest of the year i mean its certainly clear we feel better today than we did in january about our guidance and our forecast there but i do think we have to let some more time play out to see how people react to whats happening and i think even you got to be really careful to take what happened over a day or two and extrapolate too far right were seeing a bunch of that be given back today even and what weve seen over the last couple years is that every time you have this strong reaction either up or down in expectation for rates that reaction tends to moderate a little bit over a pretty short period of time and so well see how that plays out betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and obviously weve had quite a bit of activity volatility on the long end of the curve how do you think about that and is there opportunity set for maybe pulling in some more deposits and reinvesting in securities given the slightly improved longend rates here michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah yeah and weve started to do that to some degree in the first quarter where we have been starting to buy some securities mainly mortgages given where rates and levels have been and thats been a good trade i think for us so far and so i think youll certainly see us continue to deploy more cash into securities at least at some modest levels as we look forward over the next quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay super thanks so much mike michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah operator the next question will come from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just to follow up on betsys questions on the net interest income outlook you had a peer that had a more modest upgrade to that outlook than expected you held firm on your nii guide i guess to that end as we think through whether or not there are going to be three cuts or no cuts above and beyond just marking the market the nii to the rate curve is the implication to volumes right like you mentioned in response to betsys question the client behavior wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 and so i guess i just wanted to understand in terms of the range of outcomes of zero which is being talked about a couple days ago to with three embedded in your estimates how should we think about how youre thinking about volumes in terms of loans and deposit behavior in other words have you considered a wider range of volume outcomes as you think about the curve outlook michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no ill try to ill take an attempt at that erika and you can tell me if i covered it all but its certainly were at a point in time and i said this on a call with media earlier this morning like were at a time where its difficult to sort of model the different outcomes that you could expect to see with net interest income just given all the dynamics that are happening there and as you said like i think the fact that rates might be higher than what people expected a week ago that could change first of all but lets stipulate at this point people are thinking that its going to be higher for a little bit longer we do have to wait and see how clients are going to react and i think we do our best to try to come up with a range of outcomes there and given that given whats happening in rates plus whats happening in quantitative tightening whats happening in sort of the economy overall its going to all matter in terms of what happens with deposit levels and lets see how that plays out but i think as i come back to what i said earlier we feel better than we did today than we did in january about where we are but theres a lot to play out for the rest of the year erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just a followup kind of a twopart question but hopefully very related to one another the lifting of the consent order was clearly huge for how the market was perceiving wells as we think about further remediation how should we think about how your thinking about the potential cost saves that you could extract from all the processes that may be in place has been focused solely on the remediation and i ask that not in light of the usual recycled question but clearly had a massive outperformance like ebrahim mentioned on investment banking and trading and as we think about those expenses do we start expecting the reinvestment back to potentially accelerate and also on investment banking and trading i know theres a lot of seasonality but are these new run rates i guess its hard for us to tell what the base is because obviously as charlie mentioned youre underpenetrated across the board so should we continue to see a moving up of this base despite the seasonality as we look forward charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay theres a lot in there let me start mike and then you chime in so first of all mike you can comment on like investment banking and trading but again i mean were not going to answer the question on how you should think about what investment banking and trading will be in the future what were focused on are are we building businesses are we taking share in a way which is profitable and thats exactly what were starting to do and there is volatility of the business but were focused on building it over a period of time and thats what were seeing and so the way we would think about it when we look at our own forecasting is we would expect to see wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 our market shares rise over a period of time and quarterbyquarter know that it will be subject to volatility that exists michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and when you think about the first quarter in particular theres always going to be seasonality on the trading side that happens pretty much every year so you cant just take that as a run rate and on the investment banking side youve certainly seen some very high issuance volumes on the investment grade debt side so thats likely maybe pulling some issuance forward later in the year but well see and then some of the ma revenue thats embedded in there can be somewhat episodic and volatile just given the timing of deals and closing some stuff and so you do have to look at those two lines over a longer period of time charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and then on your question on expenses again it is were in the exact same place that weve been which is were not thinking about at all were not doing work were not thinking about whether there are efficiencies to be gotten out of all the risk and control work that were doing in fact were still on the other side of that which is we still have more open consent orders and were still committed to do whatever is necessary including spending whatever is necessary to get that work done properly and build it into the infrastructure of the company ive said therell be a point at which when its built into what we do and theres a high degree of confidence that it is part of the culture and our processes that we will have an opportunity to figure out how to do some of those things more efficiently but thats not on our radar screen at all what is on our radar screen is the fact that theres still a lot of inefficiency left within the company completely away from the money that were spending on this and thats where were focused and thats why we have the ability to invest in card and invest in investment banking and trading and accelerate the branch refurbishments and hire more bankers in commercial banking and things like that so ill just still continue to separate the fact that were committed to get the work done were going to do whatever is necessary to spend there and thats not the area of focus for us when it comes to efficiency erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc that was clear charlie thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay operator the next question will come from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open sir steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning charlie good morning mike wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off just on a question maybe unpacking the nii commentary a bit more in the prepared remarks mike you noted that you expected nii to be troughing towards the end of this year so less concerned about the full year outlook i was hoping you could just speak to the inputs or assumptions thats supporting that expectation around troughing or stabilization given further rate cuts that are reflected in the forward curve beyond michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and when you look at all the different factors steve theres obviously nothing thats sort of unique to sort of our balance sheet but when you look at both the asset repricing thats happening and securities you look at whats happening and you just sort of project forward on sort of the loans and the other parts of the balance sheet thats obviously a key input as you sort of look forward and then at some point you would expect that the migration and deposit mix starts to stabilize as you go forward and im a little intentional in im intentional in the words we use in terms of towards the end of the year is it right at this year is it early next year like its going to be were getting closer to that point in terms of when its going to trough calling the exact date with a high degree of certainty is difficult in this environment but its all the things that sort of weve talked about over the last few quarters are going to drive that and it starts with like deposits and deposit mix and deposit pricing and then goes through the rest of where we think the assets sort of net out steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats helpful color and for my followup might be regretting this question but charlie it relates to how you responded to erikas last one relating to the asset cap specifically and i recognize that youre focused internally on just addressing or remediating all the various consent orders but externally investors are clearly spending much more time evaluating the different potential sources of earnings or return uplift once these regulatory restrictions are eliminated whether its deposit recapture growth in trading book and reduction in that elevated risk and control spend dont expect you to quantify it dont expect you to speculate on timing for when the asset cap can get lifted but just given that focus for investors it might just be helpful if you can contextualize how youre thinking about some of those potential benefits charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure and yeah im not sure you shouldnt feel like indiscernible should ask whatever you want i just try to be as clear as i can on what i think well be in a position to answer and i dont want you guys to get frustrated by the level of consistency of the things that we want to be careful about but to your question which is i think entirely reasonable id put into couple of categories i think first of all probably the most important thing with the asset cap quite frankly is not the pure economics at this point that will come from the lifting of the asset cap it is still a reputational overhang for us wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 and while the lifting of the sales practices consent order was extremely important for those that have just read the newspapers certainly those that follow the stock care a lot about the asset cap and we understand that and so that is just initially i think an important factor in terms of how well be viewed as opposed to what well actually do i think when we look at what we have done to proactively manage the company to keep ourselves below the asset cap there are two youve got two categories youve got places where we have gone and said please make your business smaller because just because of normal deposit flows and consumer business so things like that well have some asset pressure and we need to offset at some place and then theres the opportunity cost of what we havent been able to do because weve the asset cap and then what does that mean going forward on the first piece we have limited our ability certainly within our trading businesses for some very lowrisk things such as financing our customers and things like that so by not allowing them to provide a level of financing which is very low risk we have not captured as much trading flow as we otherwise would have seen in our corporate businesses weve been very very careful to encourage our bankers to bring in sizable corporate deposits that werent clearly operational deposits and in some cases been a little more aggressive about asking them actually not to have it here because we wanted to make room for other things that we thought were really important strategically such as not being closed for business on the consumer side which those folks would not understand is hopefully just something thats temporary so those are the places that in the shortterm would benefit from the asset cap being lifted i think when you get beyond that the reality is when you look at what weve been able to do and the amount of excess capital that we have were trying to deploy that through the dividend and through our share buybacks because theres only so much that we should keep around and not return to shareholders but as i talked about we think there are plenty of opportunities when you look around our different businesses to achieve higher returns by reinvesting it inside the business its not anything which is i would describe it as dramatic but in terms of the things that we can do when we dont have the constraints indiscernible whether its our consumer business or our wealth business to build out our banking product set to be more aggressive about being full spectrum in terms of where we are on the lending side and the deposit side across all of our businesses weve been very very conservative in what we have asked people to do because we dont want to have an asset cap issue so again i would describe it as it would be the ability to grow in the things that were confident at that we do well that we have in some ways consciously even some ways unconsciously restrained the company from doing but all in all certainly without an asset cap its not a neutral its a positive because of the things that we proactively stopped as well as were just limited in our ability to take advantage of the franchise that we have and youve seen others that dont have those constraints but have the quality franchise as well and you see how they benefited not just versus us but versus the broader banking set steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no its really helpful context charlie thanks so much for taking my question wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co of course operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the nii guide i understand that you feel better about the nii outlook here but youre watching customer behavior i know you did mention loan growth did you lower your loan growth outlook thats baked into that guidance this quarter versus what you had in there last quarter and either way are you able to help us with what that expectation is on the loan growth front michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah yeah john its mike what we said in january is that we expected loans to decline in the first half and so thats about what were seeing right so again its slightly lower than what we modeled but its pretty close to sort of our expectation and then we expected a little bit of growth in the second half of the year and overall balances werent going to do much for the full year and so at this point could we be off on that a little bit maybe and could it be a little lower maybe could it be a little higher yeah for sure and so but i think the more meaningful drivers this year of where nii ends up its going to come back to deposits right and whats the level whats the mix whats the pricing look like given where the environment is and i think that will be the more meaningful place to focus john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then related to that any deposit growth expectation that you could share michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean i think it again its our fullyear guidance that we gave you or assumptions we gave you in january where we thought the commercial side would be pretty flat to where we are to where we started the year thats coming in slightly better than what we had modeled in the consumer side we would likely see a little bit of more decline as well as mix shift and again thats what youre seeing so far charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen we just and so we want to be really careful in all this right were trying to be as transparent as we can be about what were seeing without getting over our skis and making predictions that none of us have the answers to and so like when you boil it all down in terms of the customer activity that were seeing its a touch less here a touch more there theres not a big change from what we said three months ago in terms of flows on the deposit and the lending side it really is relatively small relative to the big nii picture and whats going to drive nii at this point so if we saw big changes there we might say lets change guidance but its tweaking along the way and well see how it continues to pan out wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 and then what weve said is relative to the rate environment its just again this is a full year number and weve had a couple of months go by its just too early to mark the whole thing to market based upon that but again we also wanted to just provide the context as mike has said and i said in my remarks certainly what weve seen is helpful relative to just the pure overall rate and curve piece of it john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thats very helpful i appreciate the color there if i could just ask one more along the credit side the npa decline is encouraging there and i know it can be volatile can you just maybe talk about npa inflows did you see a pullback there did you see that on the cre side is there anything to ph track in that thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no look i think what youre seeing on the when you talk about commercial real estate youre really talking about office and what you saw in the office space is actually it did not move at all and get worse or not get worse in the quarter and so you actually saw nonperforming assets coming down a little bit in the cre space as weve charged off some loans and they werent replaced by other items and so thats a positive in the sense that its not deteriorating at this point and then everything else is sort of moving around like as you would expect theres not substantial movements across the rest of the portfolio john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks mike operator the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning want to follow up on the comment that costs this year could come in higher on higher revenues investment advisory and i would assume the same if banking and trading continue to be so strong obviously thats a net positive to earnings overall but how would you frame the operating leverage if you can pick which revenue buckets but if those marketsensitive revenues are billion higher is there kind of cost that goes out how would you frame that thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and really what were referring to when we mention that is primarily in the wealth management business is where were focused given where market levels are and that business is the costtoincome ratio is pretty stable there in terms of the revenuerelated comp and so its a little less than in terms of how to think about it so the operating leverage is good matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just specifically on banking and trading i mean i know you guys invested in those businesses so theres upfront cost when the revenues come but it seems like the operating leverage in that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 segment has been very very strong and is that something that you think can continue if those revenues continue to surprise or could we see some upward pressure to costs from that again a positive to earnings overall but thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no look i think the cost to invest there as charlie noted is in our numbers right so thats already there so were already anticipating that and at this point we dont see that being a big pressure point one way or the other but obviously as you know if revenues like far exceed our expectations in a positive way that would come with a little bit of comp too so that would be a good thing overall matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah all right great okay thank you operator the next question will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi mike and hi charlie mike you touched on your noninterestbearing deposits declined to about of deposits do you guys have a sense whats the longterm normalization level for noninterestbearing deposits as you look out over the 12month horizon assuming rates do not go up we have stable rates maybe they come down a little bit michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look i mean its a hard thing to say with a whole lot of certainty gerard in terms of exactly where its going to stabilize it will stabilize at some point particularly as you look at the underlying mix of the consumer deposit base right a good chunk of our consumer deposits are in accounts less than they are generally operating accounts for a lot of people and so this thing will stabilize as we go but as youve seen weve had some pretty consistent plus or minus a little bit each quarter as weve gone through the last number of quarters but at some point soon that will start to we would expect that to stabilize but well see exactly where it does gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and is it fair to assume that the rate of change in the deposit betas is declining where eventually those deposit betas flatten out as well michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah once you start seeing more stabilization in the mix thats when youll see deposit costs on the consumer side stabilize right because what youre seeing now is people as i mentioned earlier people are spending money in their checking account low interest cost for us and then youre seeing growth in cds and some of the savings accounts which are higher cost and that mix shift will stabilize wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 its very related to your first question around noninterestbearing right theyre kind of related together right once you get to sort of that core operating balance in peoples accounts then thats when youll see both of those stabilize gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just as a followup on credit obviously you guys put up overall good numbers and especially in that commercial real estate area as you highlighted coming back to the credit cards you pointed out that the chargeoffs were up but in line with expectations assuming the economy does not head into a recession later this year and unemployment goes up to say it stays around what are you guys thinking for like a peak in net chargeoffs or credit cards so when do you think you could reach that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes look i think gerard you got to really dig into the underlying dynamics of whats happening in the portfolio right were in the middle of a refresh of our product set were seeing faster growth in new accounts and new balances coming on than maybe other players just given the investments weve been making now for the better part of three years and so with that comes some maturation of the or the new vintages at some point that should peak and youll start to see sort of the normal behavior but id just come back to we spend a lot of time looking at each of the underlying vintages here everything is performing very much on top of what we would have expected or in a couple cases maybe slightly better and the quality of the new accounts were putting on are the credit quality of them looks very good and it continues to be the case so i would just say that were in that normal phase of maturation and as it sort of peaks well sort of let you know when we sort of feel like were there but it should be coming over the coming quarters gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator and the next question will come from dave rochester of compass point research your line is open sir david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys appreciate all the color on the nii and loan trend outlook i was just wondering on the loan side if youve noted any sensitivity at all in activity levels in general amongst your commercial customers to presidential elections in the past and how big of a headwind if any you think that could be this year michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 yeah i mean thats hard i think certainly it will be a factor that people incorporate into their thinking of how aggressive or not they want to be in investments theyre making but at this point that would be really hard to kind of prove out with any sort of empirical data i think at this point what were seeing most is related to the overall sort of macroeconomic environment were in with such high rates and people having some uncertainty just generally around where things go from here but im sure that will factor in at least to a small degree at some point as we go through the year david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay appreciate that and then just on the trading line matt had mentioned the momentum youve seen earlier you obviously had a great year in trading last year you had your strongest quarter yet this year and youve talked about making a lot of investments in the business in recent years youre still making those now it seems like you have a lot of momentum in this area where you could grow that this year as well despite having a huge year last year just wanted to get your take on all that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well the environment is going to matter a lot and so weve certainly been helped by some of the volatility that weve seen over the last four five quarters and so that could change the outcome quite materially for all of us in the industry and the trading line so keep that in mind but as you said were continuing to systematically make some investments there and we feel good about that and i think we continue to see some good performance from a market share point of view across those places weve been making the investments but as charlie also noted were somewhat constrained in some of those businesses but we feel good about the progress that the team has made over the last couple of years david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks operator and our final question for today will come from vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open sir vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions couple of questions firstly financial advisers can you give some color on what those numbers have been doing over the past year past quarter since thats not disclosed anymore are you building what types of advisers is that new recruits from college any color mike michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure sure as you pointed out over the last and if you go back a couple of years ago and you definitely saw some declines that we were seeing in the adviser workforce but barry sommers and team have been working really hard to sort of not only stem some of the attrition but also begin to really ramp up the recruiting again and i think were starting to see some of that come through wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 and so a lot of that were back to like more normal maybe slightly below normal attrition levels across the business which is good and were feeling very good about our ability to recruit highquality advisers and so i think that trend you saw a couple of years ago was definitely different and well continue to stay at it were mostly focused on experienced advisers a little less on as you mentioned college recruits and that type of thing charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah the only thing listen vivek this is i mean were recruiting i mean its across theres no prototype here weve recruited some of the biggest teams in the country that have traded over the last years and these are people that wouldnt have come to wells fargo before that because of the issues and it was competitive and they chose to come here because of our capabilities not because of what were willing to pay them at the same side were staffing up in our bank branches and those are more entrylevel people people whove come out of the banker workforce and its going to be across the board but theres no doubt that the trajectory we have with our fa population is very different today than several years ago vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful a completely different question i want to go back to nii not to beat a dead horse but given that higher rates i mean sorry less rate cuts are better for you if we so that should help nii now but if we see rate cuts and eventually in does that mean that the troughing of nii could get pushed further back michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean look well see vivek where it exactly troughs obviously sort of the exact pace of rate cuts is part of the equation but we also have to look at sort of the broader trends that weve talked about throughout the call right and how do depositors sort of react where does the mix shift stabilize and what do we see from a competitive environment so all of that matters as you sort of look at where exactly its going to trough vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co all right thank you everyone
