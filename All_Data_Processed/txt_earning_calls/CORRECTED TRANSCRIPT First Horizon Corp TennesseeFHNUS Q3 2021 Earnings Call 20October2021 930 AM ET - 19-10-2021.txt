reflect our current views and that we are obligated to update them and with that ill hand things over to bryan d bryan jordan chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you ellen good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call im pleased with the continued progress across our company this quarter and believe that our results demonstrate the benefit of our more diversified model our attractive base specialty businesses and higher growth markets are starting to drive our performance we delivered eps of per share and a return on tangible common equity of over on an adjusted basis despite the nearterm headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on shortterm rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand given the continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment as markets reopen im increasingly confident that our client focused value proposition with a broad product set positions us well to be nimble and focus on the key segments where we can differentiate as a result there were several bright spots in the quarter that i think are worthy of noting our net interest income was down in the quarter given expected reductions in net mergerrelated and ppp portfolio benefit we generated core net interest income growth of with underlying loan growth of which was driven by a first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 commercial loan growth of we continue to see momentum in our commercial pipelines and the quarter ended with unfunded commitments up to just over billion our team remains strongly focused on serving clients and anticipating their needs to continue to deepen relationships across our expanded footprint our net interestbearing deposits declined basis points diminished by the cost decline basis points in the quarter the team is intensely focused on moving our cost toward peer median and we think we are well positioned to hit the target sometime next year and its also important to note that we are well positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment and ended the quarter with an interest rate sensitivity profile of a increase in the net interest income and a basis point shock across the yield curve and while we expect the total fees to be down given the relatively healthy levels of fixed income and mortgage banking fees last quarter we also saw a return to more normalized levels in traditional banking fees which were up in the quarter with particular strength in wealth on strong annuity sales credit quality continues to be excellent with improvement in the overall quality of the loan portfolio highlighted by net chargeoffs of only basis points and a decrease in loan balances on deferral in the quarter that coupled with the improving macroeconomic environment drove another robust reserve release with a provision credit of million in the quarter this was a decrease in the provision benefit this quarter versus last quarter given the impact of cecl as we look ahead provision expense will likely be a headwind for us and the industry overall as our capital levels remain strong with a cet1 ratio of around we increased our capital return by nearly in the quarter repurchasing million shares of common stock and ended the quarter with a tangible book value per share of and despite the difficult decision to delay the systems integration until february of next year we continue to execute on the objectives of the moe with strong progress on integrating systems and aligning products and capabilities including piloting the new digital platform for treasury services launching new relationship and banker profitability tools and completing the first round of banking center consolidation given some higher costs tied to integration of our platforms along with higher costs due to markets reopening much of which is marketing as well as the seasonality and the idiosyncratic items in our expenses were up in the quarter however as anthony will cover later we expect expenses to moderate in the fourth quarter alongside our integration efforts we continue to invest in technology and people to drive revenue synergies and expense efficiencies and thus far weve identified approximately million in revenue synergies tied to the merger we remain confident in our ability to deliver at least million in net annualized savings by the fourth quarter of next year as we begin to look ahead into next year im increasingly optimistic about the pace of the macroeconomic recovery as the world emerges from the pandemic and that the power of our combined organization will continue to be increasingly evident im very grateful for the dedication and hard work of our associates as they continue to work to deliver value for all of our constituents clients communities and shareholders and help drive the momentum to achieve our longterm performance objectives and now anthony will run through the financial details anthony anthony j restel chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 thanks bryan good morning to you all slide provides the highlights of the quarter most of which bryan has already covered overall we continue to make solid progress across the combined organization and were pleased to see evidence of the power of the moe starting to emerge ill briefly touch on slide where we outline the notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by million aftertax or per share in addition to mergerrelated notable items of million we recorded million of noncash pretax costs tied to retiring legacy iberiabank trust preferred securities in the quarter and expect to record an additional million next quarter the redemptions will reduce interest expense by about million annually with an expected payback of approximately five years slide provides an overview of our adjusted financials for the quarter we generated ppnr of million as underlying improvement in core net interest income and traditional banking fees was masked by the impact of expected declines in net mergerrelated and ppp net interest income along with lower fixed income and mortgage banking fees adjusted expenses of million moved higher largely reflecting idiosyncratic items tied to strategic investments and additional costs we incurred tied to markets reopening given continued improvement in the macro environment overall credit quality and muted loan growth we posted a credit to provision of million which was down from the million credit last quarter this reduction drove a decline in eps but overall we continue to post healthy returns with an adjusted return on tangible common equity of and before the impact of the provision credit as bryan mentioned tangible book value per share came in at up as gaap net income was largely offset by a impact tied to the return of capital and a decline tied to the marktomarket on the security portfolio and oci moving to slide net interest income was down million linked quarter given the expected decrease tied to lower merger accretion and ppp portfolio balances core net interest income was up as the benefit of lower deposit costs day count commercial loan growth and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression given the continued reductions in libor and the competitive landscape during the quarter we ramped up our security purchases to put more excess cash to work and added around million on a spot basis at a yield of around as a result our securities to interestearning assets ended the quarter at up our current plan is to put a total of billion of excess cash to work in securities by yearend and we will continue to reevaluate opportunities to redeploy additional cash as we move forward reported nim was down basis points linked quarter with core nim down basis points driven by a basis point impact tied to higher excess cash we ended the quarter with excess cash of billion up from billion in the second quarter core nim was also lower given a basis point reduction in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans as well as overall spread tightening with new origination spreads down around basis points linked quarter which collectively translated to about basis points of pressure on the margin we also generated a basis point benefit to the margin with further improvement in the deposit mix towards dda and a decline in interestbearing deposits i would also note that this quarter we added disclosure to the relationship of core net interest income to risk weighted assets to help illustrate the impact of nii excluding the excess cash position under this view you can see that yearoveryear the metric is down about basis points compared to the core margin which is down about basis points first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 and on slide lets cover the puts and takes on fees headline fees were down around in the quarter this reflected anticipated declines in other noninterest income and fixed income and mortgage that were partially offset by growth in brokerage trust and insurance tied to higher annuity sales as well as higher service charges and fees as an increase in transaction volume and higher leasing income tied to terminations helped to mitigate the impact of a recent change in our nsf pricing structure fixed income average daily revenue came in at million compared with million last quarter mortgage banking and title fees were down million given continued spread tightening and our focus on driving more of our originations on balance sheet while overall originations were down for the quarter portfolio originations were up the reduction in our other noninterest income was driven by an million decrease in security gains tied to a legacy ibkc investment in the second quarter with regard to service charges we recently began aligning key features across the legacy institutions approach to service charges with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the experience for our clients the new program was launched in late august at first horizon with the remainder of the change occurring following the system conversions in february for our iberiabank franchise over time we expect the changes to reduce our overall nsf overdraft fees in the range of million to million annually with changes going into production in august for first horizon and with the february conversion for the iberiabank clients lets turn to slide and review expense trends adjusted expenses totaled million up million in the quarter largely because of seasonality and some idiosyncratic costs related to strategic investments and additional costs related to markets reopening which was slightly offset by million tied to incremental merger cost saves personnel expenses decreased million linked quarter with salaries and benefits stable as a million fica credit helped mitigate the impact of day count seasonally higher medical costs and labor supply constraints incentives and commissions remain relatively stable as a million increase from pandemicrelated vacation carryover partially offset lower revenue base payouts in fixed income and mortgage i should note that as we continue to shift more of our mortgage originations on balance sheet you will see a reduction in mortgage fee income without a corresponding reduction in incentives additionally higher contractor costs tied to investments in new systems largely in areas like treasury solutions and business banking online as well as increased advertising spend given our reopening of markets pushed outside services up million and finally other noninterest expense was up million in the quarter driven by higher tax creditrelated contributions a million increase in fraud cost and higher in travel and entertainment costs also for markets reopening we are focused on driving efficiencies and identifying opportunities to redeploy expenses toward areas which provide higher growth for the organization particularly post the systems conversions in february on slides and we cover our balance sheet profile excluding ppp balances which were now billion in the quarter average loans increased in the quarter and as bryan mentioned this reflected commercial growth of our pricing strategies in the mortgage warehouse business helped deliver a increase in balances with purchase volume up percentage points linked quarter to additionally we continue to see traction in other specialty businesses with a growth in assetbased lending equipment finance and franchise finance somewhat offset by a reduction in commercial real estate given the first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 higher levels of refinancing activity from the capital markets this is being somewhat offset by a continued pressure in retail real estatesecured refinancings which drove a decline in consumer loans but were reviewing opportunities to increase our recapture of these with refi opportunities overall we are pleased to see the path of the economic recovery and the increased activity levels across our footprint translate to this level of loan growth on the liability side we saw a continued inflow of deposits driven by a billion average increase in dda of which helped to further improve the mix of deposits and with the interestbearing deposit cost down basis points to basis points for the quarter our total funding costs improved basis points as bryan mentioned we are intensely focused on driving our interestbearing deposit costs down toward peer median levels on slide and we provide information on asset quality and reserves where we continue to see exceptional low levels of chargeoffs and nonperforming loans and our allowance coverage of loans is healthy at and excluding loans from mortgage companies and the ppp portfolio additionally when you consider the unrecognized discount on acquired loans our total loss absorption is roughly which is very strong turning to capital on slide our cet1 ratio of down from in the second quarter tied to the accelerated share repurchases in the quarter loan growth and higher unfunded commitments as bryan mentioned we returned million in capital to common shareholders during the quarter including million or million shares of common stock repurchases moving on to merger integration on slide while we had to delay the core systems conversions to early next year we continue to make substantial progress across a number of fronts during the quarter we completed a couple of mock conversion events and completed our wealth and trust and credit card conversions finalized the mortgage system conversion and launched the pilot of our new online banking platform for commercial customers we achieved million in annualized run rate savings against our net target of million additionally we continued making solid traction on revenue synergies and have thus far identified roughly million of annualized revenue synergies that are tied to commercial loans and additional synergies tied to debt capital markets mortgage and private client wealth we are extremely focused on retaining and growing our client base by continuing to enhance or expand our set of products and services on slide we provided our fourth quarter outlook we expect nii to be down at the high end of the lowsingle digit range with average interestearning assets and loans down modestly given the outlook for reduced merger accretion and ppp benefits and continued low rates we expect to continue to see modest loan growth excluding ppp and that we will see benefits as we continue to lower deposit cost at periodend we had a total of billion in ppp loans including million related to round one and total ppp fees of million we expect the vast majority of the round one portfolio to be forgiven by the end of the year and that the round two will largely be forgiven by the third quarter of next year regarding noninterest income we expect fee income to be down in the mid to highsingledigit range with additional decreases tied to our nsf pricing changes and seasonally lower mortgage and wealth fees as well as further moderation in fixed income we expect noninterest expense to decrease in the lowsingledigit range with higher third quarter levels which included investments seasonality costs tied to markets reopening and some idiosyncratic items and our outlook calls for chargeoffs to be in the range of basis points to basis points and that its reasonable to see continued reserve outflows near term first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 finally we expect our cet1 ratio to remain in the to range as bryan mentioned we feel good about our positioning and our ability to perform well given the current economic environment finally slide includes our short and longterm objectives we believe our more diversified model and highly attractive franchise will continue to deliver revenue synergies and loan growth our moe objectives to complete the systems integration and to identify other expenses to redeploy to higher growth and higher return opportunities will allow us to continue to support the dynamic digital needs of our clients and associates and drive continuous improvement in productivity and efficiency beyond the integration and as we continue to actively manage capital our balance sheet and credit quality performance position us well to continue to deliver attractive results near term and into the future and with that ill give the call back to bryan d bryan jordan chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you anthony im excited about the momentum and the results of the combined organization what weve achieved this quarter the power of our attractive franchise with the benefit of a more diversified business model and higher growth markets is evident in our results the progress we have made towards our merger integration objectives continues to deliver revenue synergies to provide our clients with improved products and technology as the macroeconomic environment continues to improve our capital structure and risk management infrastructure positions us to deliver higher growth and top quartile returns into the future i am grateful again to our associates for their dedication towards building and strengthening client relationships and supporting our communities and i am confident in our ability to become a topperforming regional bank and to drive enhanced shareholder value with that kate well now open it up for questions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone just anthony a point of clarification on the nii guide the high end of the lowsingle digits does that mean or anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good okay and on the expense side the reopening costs continue to tick up and are kind of chewing into the cost saves i know there wasnt a lot of progress there this quarter but just curious as you look forward are the reopening costs kind of fully in there or is there more potential headwind there that could mute the cost saves that you have remaining anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee no i think the reopening costs are largely are kind of in the numbers now casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good okay and then just lastly on the fee side the nsf fee policy change and the fixed income is or you mentioned as potential drags where do you can you give us some color on where adrs you expect to trend this quarter and then where can the service charges line run rate in the fourth quarter d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah casey this is bryan the fixed income business is inherently unpredictable we still feel good about the environment theres still a tremendous amount of excess liquidity across the financial system and bond activity continues to be good our forecast for the year is million average daily revenue and we expect that well fall in that range for the full year so that implies a little lower level than in the fourth quarter but we still expect to be in that million in average daily revenue on the nsf fees we have done some made some changes to one reflect our desire to be more customer friendly which has some impact on it and then the fact that the liquidity is so strong it has driven down the nsfod service charge fees et cetera in this environment the changes we made on an annual basis amount to about million on an annual basis so its a on a quarterly basis itll be rather insignificant but we think it will be better for customer acquisition retention and growth over the long term first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah and then casey one just to add just since i know this somewhat turns into a modeling for you that number that bryan mentioned on the annual impact is not an equivalent number every quarter right so just recognize that typically early in the year a lot of our consumer customers benefit from tax refunds et cetera which kind of keep the number deflated in the early part of the year and then typically it accelerates through the year so just know that its not a flat number every quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just one more the deposit growth obviously continues to be very strong youve got the cash position increased again this quarter what is the do you expect that to continue the liquidity strength and then what is a normalized cash position for you guys anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah i do think that the cash unfortunately probably continues to build just recognize as we continue through the ppp forgiveness process that we end up receiving cash from that as we kind of go through that exercise so we do have cash will likely continue to be very strong for us what ill tell you is we probably have i dont know bryan maybe billion to billion of excess cash relative to what we would typically hold in a kind of more normalizedtype environment d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee and ill remind you although its painful and we always spend a lot of time talking about what were going to do to use the cash or dispose of the cash just recognize that cash is coming in its something lower than slightly lower than what we earn on the cash and so although its painful just recognize that were earning basis points and in a lot of cases yes it is inflating the balance sheet but when you look at the growth during the quarter were really not paying anything for that so although i dont like it because it creates a lot of noise for us i dont mind the concept of picking up a lot of nickels along the way to generate some income d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee the other thing that it does too anthony is it adds deposit lag when it then starts to increase right it gives a tremendous amount of liquidity and i think across the board for the industry youll see more deposit lag than has been historically modeled simply because of that level of liquidity casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks casey operator the next question is from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so if i look at loan growth for the quarter ex ppp and ex the warehouse i think loan growth was about linked quarter annualized and i was just wondering if you had any thoughts on doing an amount of loan growth better than that i mean weve seen especially this quarter weve seen some of your peers really start to inflect synovus like for example grew linked quarter annualized this quarter i know pinnacle was even over that so some of your peers are putting up notably higher loan growth as were coming out of covid so just wondering if you guys could comment on the idea of better loan growth beyond just the level you saw this quarter d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah ill start brady and then ill ask susan to add any color if she likes shes very very close to this this is an interesting environment and the demand for loan growth is not extraordinarily high even with the recovery we see the markets being very very competitive and if i had to characterize the markets that say that theyre becoming very competitive on price on structure and on term and were being selective one of the things that we have emphasized and we highlighted in our comments a couple of different ways this morning is we want to protect the integrity of the balance sheet and want to protect credit quality so were being very thoughtful about price structure and term with an eye towards longterm credit quality that said we see real opportunity in our customer base were seeing real strong momentum across our franchise our pipelines have continued to strengthen we have highlighted on this call that our commitments were up about quarteroverquarter which is in my view springloading the balance sheet for future growth and so im optimistic about our ability to grow loans and to protect credit quality we dont get fixated on setting a number that weve got to go out and hit weve focused on one acquiring good bankers having our bankers focus on their customers and the communities and picking up the opportunities and being competitive that exist in the marketplace im not close enough to others results to have a sense of what drove their growth but im encouraged about our ability to grow loans in a quality fashion first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 susan anything you want to add to that susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee sure we are seeing good momentum in pipeline also as was mentioned earlier the revenue synergies from the combined organization are really really starting to show up with referrals into assetbased lending equipment finance both of those areas had good increases quarteroverquarter and if you look at pipeline theres additional pipeline for revenue synergies in addition to those specialty businesses were seeing strength in our markets which as you know are very very good strong growth markets so texas georgia north carolina florida middle tennessee et cetera were in some of the best markets in the southeast in texas in addition to that market as good markets weve had good success continuing to hire both relationship managers and market leaders in some of those markets that are very very important to us from a highgrowth perspective in addition to new to bank type relationships that were getting both from existing bankers as well as some of these folks that were bringing over these strong producers were also selectively taking higher hold limits with our existing clients as a result of our larger balance sheet so were very optimistic about the future but as bryan said we will remain prudent and be selective brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then my second question is on just deploying the cash into the bond book over time and i hear you youre going to do another billion by the end of the year but as anthony said you have billion to billion of excess cash which sounds like its not going anywhere anytime soon the long end of the curve is starting to rise here i mean as we look into should we think about more cash being pushed into the bond book over time kind of similar to what you all have done on the back half of this year anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah brady so just a point of clarification right so we announced putting billion in in the last quarterly conference call weve got about or so million of that done in the third quarter so weve got a little bit million ill call it tailpiece of it we expect to get done by the end of the year look the good news is rates are moving up but ill tell you i think were going to kind of roll through the end of the year and then reevaluate kind of where we think we are relative to where the economy is at and what makes sense for us right so as you know right the expectation for an increase in federal funds continues to creep forward and so i think were going to as opposed to telling you what were definitely going to do now what i would tell you is were going to evaluate it relative to what makes the most sense for us but i think its probably prudent here to wait and see what kind of evolves over the next two to three months before we make that call so its a good question for the january conference call brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats fair all right thanks guys first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator the next question is from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so bryan on the increase in commitments youre calling out was that from existing customers or new customers and then when you say that competition is high on price structure and term is that from peer regional banks larger banks maybe give some color there too d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee the last part is yes its across the board the competition starts with smaller institutions all the way up through some of the bigger players and its really trying to show growth in a period where loan demand is not as strong as you might expect its reasonably intuitive i suppose given the amount of excess liquidity that sits in the system we talk about the excess liquidity on our balance sheet thats customers money so that means that they dont need to borrow as much the commitment is a combination of things a lot of it is construction lending one of the variables that we and everybody else is dealing with i suppose is in just the sheer amount of payoffs our commercial real estate business for example had very strong originations in the second and the third quarter but payoffs were actually greater theres an end to that and so when we book a new loan in commercial real estate that loan will fund up that flows into those numbers so its a mixture of existing customers its a mixture of new customers weve got a very nice blend were seeing good momentum across the franchise in our higher growth markets and some of our more stable markets one of first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 the ones thats done extremely well over the last several quarters is alabama for example were seeing great growth opportunities there and acquiring new customer relationships steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats actually very helpful i wanted to shift gears and follow up on the million annual impact from the nsf pricing change which is actually fairly minimal how much revenue would you have ultimately given up if you just eliminated the transfer fee also anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee ill tell you what let us see if we can we dont have that right in front of us let us see if we can dig that up during the call and if we can get it well come back before we get off d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee it will be more than million steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc more than million okay maybe helpful to see that number and maybe bryan just final a big picture question so looking at the list of items on slide regarding the merger integration theres still quite a bit of wood to chop right particularly with the system conversion being delayed a bit when do you see the company moving more fully back on offense right lets focus on retaining staff more focus on recruiting staff is this a mid2022 event and is that the point where well start to see the growth that this new company is capable of delivering thanks d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah so first on the deferral of the integration event we passed the columbus day weekend and like everybody else we had hoped that we would have it done then as i reflect back on the decision that we were making in the midst of ida and being forced to drop customer notifications et cetera on the monday following out ida hitting new orleans on sunday i feel good about that decision i think seeing the devastation there the difficulty in recovery in the market and the impact on our associates and our ability to train and deploy technology et cetera and then the impact on our customers i think that was a good move we will get that integration completed in february i have a high degree of confidence and well make good use of the time weve talked about the impact on one time as weve talked about the impact on delay in cost savings first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 i would say that you will start to see the significant benefits of the integration starting in the last part of the first quarter and clearly picking up on the cost savings side in the second quarter of i think as we sort of alluded to in a number of different ways were starting to see the benefit of the revenue side of it today weve mentioned the million in revenue and weve talked about the acquisition of customers in the franchise so i would tell you that our markets that our bankers are very much frontfooted theyre looking to bring talented bankers on to the platform susan mentioned that weve hired a new president for example in dallas has come on to our platform into the organization were hiring bankers so i think were very much frontfooted and i think you will see that momentum start to build over the next couple of quarters and into steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee hey steve following up on your question right if you look at kind of the kind of run rate where we are if you adjust for that million number were around million in remaining nsf fees on an annual basis now keep in mind thats relative to transaction volumes and all today so that could all change that would be the current kind of run rate steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect thanks a lot d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yes operator the next question is from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just one clarification on the earlier expense question anthony i think youre saying that q4 expenses probably dropped back down to the levels we saw in q1 and q2 is that fair anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah the expenses will pull back jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and some of the other items thats what youre talking about that will come out is that right anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah look we had some items that dont reach the definition of kind of ill call it a one time but from our view that we dont expect them to repeat and so those will certainly roll down a little bit and then clearly as we expect to see some moderation within that fee income there are several incentive kind of structures tied to those fees and so that will also roll down thats what gives us the confidence that well see the decline in the expenses in the fourth quarter d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee jon this is bryan we hadnt been spending much on marketing we increased our marketing spend in the quarter as one of the things that we called out i mentioned that we were piloting a new treasury services platform we havent taken out the old treasury services platform on either side but were now depreciating the new one as well so theres a little bit of redundancy that has sort of gotten built up thats what drove a lot of the surge in the third quarter i would hang my hat on the fact that we have demonstrated in the past that we have the ability to control and take cost out of the organization and that were focused on that and im confident and i think i said in my opening comments at least million in cost savings i feel good about our ability to reduce the cost of doing business and i would look at this as sort of a onetime aberrational trend and as anthony said youll start to see expenses coming down later this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah youve been great on expenses maybe for susan andor bryan thoughts on where the reserve could go longer term it still seems a little bit elevated relative to your credit quality and i just want to square that bryan with some of your prepared comments saying that provision expense is likely to be a headwind for you and for the industry help us figure out exactly what you mean on that thanks first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah ill start jon we are assuming that the economy continues to emerge from covid which obviously it is doing that now and after any other events we believe that we could see coverage get back down to kind of the cecl day one coverage in the million range or so so thats kind of what were thinking d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah and my comments about the headwind we highlighted we had a reserve release i think it was million and while million is great this quarter is less than it was last quarter and reserve releases will continue down inherent in cecl every dollar of loan growth requires that youre actually booking reserves so to the extent we brought it down million further loan growth we booked we ended up at a ex ppp et cetera we were setting up reserve were just sort of acknowledging that reserve releases over time will diminish and that as we get into a point where we get to this million prececl day one area prepandemic area that those reserves under cecl bill when you book a loan you essentially book the life of loan losses so you front end the credit cost on it and its just going to be a headwind for us and the industry is all were trying to highlight jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right so more of a longerterm comment is what youre saying there okay thank you d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yes yes anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee thank you d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator the next question is from michael rose of raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to go back to the fixed income business as we get into a rising rate environment i think if i look back to the way the business performed last cycle there was some pressure on adr as you guys did the coastal securities during that period as well which helped to soften the decline but can you just remind us how in a rising rate environment the adrs would trend assuming we get there sometime later next year into thanks first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah thanks michael this is bryan the fixed income business is going to be affected by really the shape of the yield curve more in this cycle i think than rising rates a couple of thoughts on our expectations one we still have a reasonably steep yield curve and the longer term of the curve the longer end of the curve has been moving up and with the significant liquidity that exists and the financial system and the continued level of prepayments its actually been good for the bond business even in a rising rate environment so our expectation is that the fed will continue to reduce purchases or start to reduce purchases they continue to sort of telegraph that theyre going to do it later this year start to reduce purchases under the quantitative easing program that will diminish over the course of the first half of that will steepen the yield curve a bit the longterm expectations will come up but we think theres a tremendous amount of liquidity and then that will drive a significant fixed income revenue if you get a significant move in the short portion of the curve that would be less attractive for the business but weve got a significant offset in the extreme interest sensitivity or ill say a very strong interest sensitivity interest rate sensitivity that we have to the rising shortterm rates where the vast majority of our balance sheet is so we dont expect a significant spike in the short term rates we do expect that the fed will start moving up either late next year or early but the bond business will continue to be good because youve got a relatively steep curve michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color and back a couple of years ago during that cycle the guidance for adrs was kind of in the million to million a day range any reason to think that it would be different this goround just broad strokes d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee id tell you what im not going to you might talk anthony into putting that range out there again he and i missed that one for so many quarters that we had to say we were wrong and i think as i look into i dont think that theres something in that million call it million to million range is a bad range but i dont know what i dont know about interest rates and its a business that we trade every single day we deliver bonds to our customers we buy bonds from our customers and the shape of the yield curve will impact it so while we can have the expectation today we dont know what the rates really look like we just have to position for them michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee no youre welcome thank you operator the next question is from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks just in terms of the expenses im thinking of that million of cost savings related to the deal is there going to be a meaningful stepdown in expenses when the system conversion happens in february of next year i mean would we notice it from our end thanks anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah ken its anthony i think youre going to see just because the conversion is kind of towards the tail end of february that the more likely scenario is youll really see the significant move in the second quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and with sorry would second quarter actually be like absolute dollars lower or just lack of growth im just trying to gauge the magnitude of what were talking about anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee no no no we should see a significant stepdown as we kind of move between the second and third quarters not just that were not growing the expenses should start to decline ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i see all right perfect and then just a clarification question in the guidance slide you mentioned that you expect modest loan growth ex ppp in fourth quarter i know this quarter you had i think it was like up ex ppp on a core basis when you say modest are you talking sort of a similar or what number are you sort of thinking of there thanks anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah so i think were looking at total loans ex ppp something around that 1ish it will up so thats a good range to kind of think about ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator the next question is from jennifer demba of truist please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 good morning jennifer susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc bryan question for you on ma weve seen a lot of deals this year im wondering where you think first horizon stands after the merger integration next year and what are your thoughts on future ma for first horizon d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yes there have been quite a few number of transactions i dont know how the world changes but as we sit here today my expectation is that weve got so many tremendous growth opportunities in places to deploy capital across our franchise post this integration that merger and acquisition is not really a priority for us there are a couple of dimensions that go into that i think when we get this integration while we will have eliminated the vast majority of any technology deficits that have existed we still believe that the goalposts continue to move on technology and we have a number of things that we think well continue to invest in feature functionality that will be better for our customers and add to our growth rate we feel strongly about our ability to capitalize on being in of the top msas in the south and really the opportunity to leverage the relatively small or new presence that we have in many of those markets and finally the other thing thats a practical consideration is were in round numbers in billion billion balance sheet you dont just sort of stumble across billion threshold so in our view we want to focus on organic growth growing our customer base and taking advantage of these markets and we think that coming out of this integration well be uniquely positioned to demonstrate the power of this franchise so thats a long way of saying ma is not a priority and in our view is not the next logical step we dont believe you can win a spending game when it comes to technology scale matters but its not the only thing that matters and we want to execute and demonstrate the power of this footprint and this franchise jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee youre welcome thank you operator the next question is from jared shaw of wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks for taking the questions i guess a couple one followup on the acl when you talk about the approaching the day one level the basis points is that something you think like should we be thinking about by the end of we could get there or is that something that with the improving economy we could get there faster than that susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee absolutely as youve mentioned there are a number of factors i think the economy continues to improve and there is not another variant or something else that hints its possible it could be midyear next year as bryan said earlier some of it just depends on other things that we cant predict at this point jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then taking that extra time for the systems conversion has that allowed you to find any incremental opportunities to emphasize or expand technology and digital offerings that werent initially considered anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah so we have not really significantly changed our scope of what we plan to deliver for the conversion weve taken the extra time really to run through additional mocks and dress rehearsals will be in place just to make sure that the client experiences what we want certainly around the edges theres been a few ill call it client experience opportunities which we enhanced but for the most part we havent really changed the scope of what we intended to do from a conversion perspective d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee and coupled with the decline in delta variant at the time gives more opportunity to do training on systems and get our people better prepared than they might otherwise have been jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just finally for me how are spreads on the new loan production this quarter and do you think that were at a bottom yet on incremental loan yields anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah look spreads came in about basis points lower quarteroverquarter i always like to say theres a limit to how low they can go so i think as we think about the core nii right we see some stability within that kind of number but ill call it and we have modeled in in terms of going forward our expectations for some continued level of spread compression first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 the wild card really is the competitive environment where that might drive us so i think the guidance weve given is pretty clear in terms of we feel good that were kind of reaching a trough at least in our view on that core ph not core number but like bryan said the competitive environment continues to evolve and so just recognize that that is out there as well jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just first question as a followup bryan and youve touched on this on some of the responses but i think when you talk to longerterm holders i think theres some frustration around just when do we see the power of the franchise and is it fair from the outside i think anthony talked about by the end of everything starts coming together should we look at in terms of rotce loan growth revenue growth as the year where you should be outperforming your peers and kind of delivering on all the great things weve expected post the deal d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah so ebrahim this is bryan i think you will start to see the power of the franchise i think youre actually seeing its masked a little bit by some of the transition and some of the feeoriented businesses but the loan growth pipelines and what were seeing across the franchise were starting to see emerging signs of it and we feel very strongly that by this time next year you will see the strength of our ability to grow this franchise given our expectations for the macroeconomic environment the interest rate environment for anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah and then one other thing ebrahim just to point out i mean i realize everybody probably knows us but as we head into all the various conversions that were doing whether its card conversion whether were putting people on tm products right we do go into some ill call it some closeout periods where were not selling legacy iberiabank clients into a new product to then have them onboard and then have to convert them right first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 so just recognize that there are some natural things that limit our ability to do some sales as we kind of move up to the conversion point and so all of those ill call it safety nets kind of come off relative to the client experience in terms of making sure we dont have to move them twice and so i think with all of that stuff kind of out of the way i think youll start to see some of the incremental kind of push not only on the loan sales but really across the other fee categories and the crossselling efforts that we know are going to be pretty strong ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just a separate question and apologize if you addressed this i think in september you announced a partnership with wipro on the virtualbank cloud infrastructure just talked i dont think thats a same provider for the bank just give us a sense of whats the play with virtualbank is there a bigger sort of strategic sort of plan in terms of breaking it out at some point and what virtual does on both lending and deposit side anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah so look were so you kind of hit ebrahim ill call it a couple of different things and ill tell you were very excited about the virtualbank we were the first bank actually to convert off of a legacy system on to that kind of new fintech core in the cloud environment and we continue to build out that the reception to the kind of the product and the offering has been really good we havent quite unveiled to the masses yet ill call it the strategy that were really going to employ you should expect that well continue to build out product functionality capabilities within the virtualbank and that well have a distinct marketing effort in kind of how were going to brand it and drive it going forward youll see that in the next call it three to six months where itll become more apparent to you but for the near term right our intent is to grow it to where it can support itself and kind of really help us drive not only revenue but learning and experiences in terms of seeing what takeaways we can bring back to the bigger larger bank it will be part of first horizon for the foreseeable future so theres no intent right now to do something different other than grow it learn from it make profit from it and then longer term well see what happens ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just anthony you spent a lot of time during the last year around the integration looking at fintech vendors as you come out of the conversion talk to us about the top one two three things that the bank needs to do from a system and technology upgrade perspective that im assuming will be a multiyear process and bryan if you want to jump in d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 yeah look ill tell you that i think the biggest thing as we kind of move so bryan talked about really that weve really closed most of the technology deficits and gaps that we wanted to get closed as we were kind of leading up to it so i would say as a starting spot i think that were in a pretty good position technologywise related to call it peers still have some work to do around the edges on a few things that we need to do some upgrades on but i think what really matters to us as we move forward is really about leaning in on those things that can drive significant improvement in either our efficiencies or our deliveries so the credit process is one that that really kind of stands out and so obviously weve installed ncino and then with that whether its frontend side of that or backend side of what were going to do there i think is it can be pretty powerful so expect well hear more about how weve kind of taken and gone further with that whole ncino upgrade to really drive a complete improvement the second thing is the treasury management platform weve had both companies have made a strategic priority to invest and recognize growth in the tm space that should continue weve started on that journey we made significant investment i will tell you that im very proud and i think the tm system that well have will put us in the kind of top echelon of available tm systems once were kind of through all of our pilots and all and so you should expect to hear us to continue to really lean into that with more investment and more development and then of course with that you should expect to get some nice growth out of that so those are probably the two big that kind of land relative to the ill call it driving revenue and that you would see on the back side weve put in some new performance management type tools to help our regional presidents and bankers fully understand the profitability and depth of their books which should help us not only improve overall profitability just from clarity but really point out crosssell opportunities et cetera so those if i had to put three kind of items on the table ill tell you those are probably the big three that are going to have the most impact for next year d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee i would add ebrahim i think anthony and randy bryan have done a fantastic job building the core for us to focus on driving our technology and improving technology over the long term one of the things im really excited about with anthony putting on a new hat later this year to run our regional banking franchise is him and his process technologyorientation being much closer to the customer and understanding customer needs and competitive landscape weve got a great push capability i think anthony leading our regional bank and working with our bankers will create more pull for technology so i think well be better endtoend as a result of the infrastructure thats been built and having somebody with anthonys vision to help us get better with that and in customerfacing sense all the time anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah and then ebrahim i apologize you asked me about wipro i just want to tell you that we use wipro for a number of things integration of systems but a big healthy dose of helping us testing of what were doing to make sure were getting it right before we deploy stuff theyve been a fabulous partner for us and so i just want to give you some context so theyll be around helping us on a lot of different things through the upcoming years but theyve been a fabulous partner for us ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks for taking my questions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 operator the next question is from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks susan i wanted to ask about the modestly lower unfunded commitment reserves when the ci commitments went up is that purely related to credit trends that you outlined earlier and would we see that reserve slip further susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah i mean we just when you look at just the economic environment as well as our own asset quality those were the main drivers both for unfunded commitment and funded christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so its the same trend even though the commitments have gone up susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and then anthony back to the service charge commentary have you seen visibility on behavior changes that lead to transaction volumes or is it more just seasonal activity that you were citing earlier anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee what ill tell you chris and im sure you can appreciate this right customer behavior dynamics have shifted postcovid and so certainly that has an impact to us and then theres just a tremendous amount of liquidity right if you think about our excess cash that all sits in not only our commercial customers but a lot of our consumers have more so overall nsf fees right in terms of a historical pattern will probably break from any historical kind of precedent and so its probably too early for me to tell you exactly where things are going to go the number i gave you was kind of the current run rate adjusted for that so im trying to give you the best info i got but ill be the first to tell you that transaction volumes are starting to reemerge i think we said transaction volumes were up about and so we kind of have to see where things go just its a different world and so its a little bit hard to look at historical numbers to give you a real sense that thats going to be the trend going forward christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no i understand and i appreciate the background thanks very much anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 thank you d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks chris operator the next question is from brett rabatin of hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning i wanted to make sure i understood the guidance around nii in the fourth quarter the high single digit or high end of the lowsingledigit decrease which assumes lower accretion in ppp with relatively stable core nii can you maybe break that apart a little bit in terms of the core nii versus the linked quarter change in accretion in ppp susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee so brett our core nii was up about million linked quarter so when you say break it this quarter so are you talking about brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc well for the fourth quarter susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee right so id say i think we believe that the core nii and margin have relatively bottomed this quarter but were going to continue to see some headwinds from merger accretions come in so d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee and lower ppp susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee and lower ppp so overall we think of low single digits as being to so were saying it can be down that level but we could see a continued probably modest performance in core brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then you were talking earlier im curious about the cfo position and if you think you might make some announcement this year or if that might drag out into d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 yeah so first i would say i really appreciate what anthony is doing hes wearing a number of hats and doing a fantastic job with that so im grateful for what hes doing i think were making a good progress anthony and really our entire leadership team have been engaged weve seen a number of good internal and external candidates and we think that that we are making very good progress and if i had to guess this year or next i think we will get to a conclusion this year brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then maybe one last one in your prepared comments you were talking about the revenue synergies million i want to make sure that i was clear would that be fee income or would that be more product sets on the lending side for the iberia franchise anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee its a little bit of both right so weve got weve had some expansion of ill call it credit to put use in the larger balance sheet to kind of provide larger credit to some of our existing clients also our leasing products effectively show up as kind of loan balances as well at the same time right weve been able to crosssell some wealth and weve captured some international fees as well as some debt capital market fees so its really a combination if you ask me to kind of weigh it in my head ill tell you the predominance would show up as loan balances in that number that i gave d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee its pretty impressive to me brett when i look at where the synergies are coming from if weve got something like million to million of the incremental synergy revenue is coming just from referrals between our equipment finance equipment leasing business and the old first horizon franchise and then referrals in the abl business from the old iberiabank franchise and those are opportunities that we wouldnt otherwise have gotten weve got the other benefits of larger balance sheet but just the product synergies the mortgage product i think will be a huge win as we go forward private client wealth management is starting to build in a significant way im very optimistic about our ability and weve talked a lot about the product set but i think the bigger franchise and footprint that we can spread this combined product set around will drive i think a lot of revenue as we go forward susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee the only thing i would add too is that theres a lot of excitement about our relationship managers at both legacy banks because of the expanded products that being able to now offer as an example the equipment leasing equipment finance when we might have had to refer that outside the company so theres a lot of excitement around that and we are seeing pipeline growth as a result of that expanded offering from both companies coming together brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats great color appreciate that first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 d bryan jordan a chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator this
