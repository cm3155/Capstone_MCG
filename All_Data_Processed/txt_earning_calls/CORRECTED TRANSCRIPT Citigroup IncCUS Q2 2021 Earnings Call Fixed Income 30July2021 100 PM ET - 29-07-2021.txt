thank you tom and good afternoon everyone on todays call i will cover a number of topics first ill briefly discuss our first half operating results second i will cover recent balance sheet trends third ill review our issuance program and finally ill discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position slide summarizes our results for the second quarter and first half of in the second quarter we reported net income of billion and for the half we reported billion both higher than comparable periods in driven by significant reserve releases on slide we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars on this basis we have grown our balance sheet by approximately over the last year as we continued to support our consumer and institutional clients as they manage through the covid19 health crisis while also maintaining a strong balance sheet in the second quarter deposits continued to grow reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients in a period of elevated liquidity loans increased sequentially driven by growth in icg while consumer loans remained under pressure driven by elevated payment rates tradingrelated assets and liabilities grew reflecting a continuation of strong client engagement and longterm debt decreased as we continued to optimize our balance sheet given our strong liquidity position and deposit growth slide presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars total citigroup loans decreased year over year in our consumer franchise average loans declined year over year as high levels of liquidity continued to drive elevated payment rates in our institutional franchise average loans decreased year over year as strong growth in markets and private bank was offset by repayments and reduced demand for loans in corporate lending sequentially total loans grew in tts markets and the private bank and corporate lending repayments slowed on slide we show credit quality trends in our gcb and icg loan portfolios in icg credit quality remained broadly stable in the second quarter nonaccrual loans declined sequentially to billion or basis points of total loans reflecting portfolio upgrades and repayments in gcb overall credit trends improved given high levels of liquidity in the us and improvements in international consumer credit performance after losses peaked in the first quarter and with credit reserves of billion we believe we are well prepared for expected credit losses across both our consumer and institutional portfolios turning to slide we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars total average deposits increased from the prioryear period reflecting continued client engagement in a period of elevated liquidity now let me cover our parent benchmark debt issuance program on slide so far this year we have issued roughly billion going forward well continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors currencies and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and support our clients citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 on slide let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectations we previously expected issuance of billion to billion but we now expect issuance at the low end of that range all in our parent benchmark program as we see elevated levels of liquidity in the bank and we will maintain the flexibility to optimize our funding through opportunistic redemptions on slide we show the composition of our longterm debt outstanding during the second quarter our total longterm debt increased by approximately billion to roughly billion reflecting an increase in nonbank debt partly offset by a continued reduction in bank debt on slide we provide an update of our lcr metrics and drivers our average lcr decreased modestly to this quarter turning to slide let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio increased modestly to with net income largely offset by buybacks and dividends and our slrs were and for citigroup and citibank respectively the decline in citigroups slr from the prior quarter was largely driven by the expiration of the temporary slr relief moving to our last slide let me summarize several key points the franchise continued to perform well through the pandemic we earned over billion of net income in the first half including a credit reserve release of roughly billion we maintained a strong capital position with a cet1 capital ratio of an slr of and a surplus above our tlac requirement we also maintain a strong liquidity position with an average lcr of over billion of available liquidity resources and we are comfortably in compliance with the nsfr rule which became effective on july while we expect continued macroeconomic improvement our capital and liquidity position us well for a range of scenarios and we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in ways that deepen and expand our client relationships and support the broader recovery before we move on to qa let me touch briefly on libor we appreciate the flexibility afforded by the iba in their extension of most tenors of us dollar libor until mid2023 as it relates to a legislative solution the recently enacted new york state law to address the phaseout of libor as a benchmark rate is clearly a positive development as is the similar proposed federal legislation with regard to this subset of our preferreds which we have mentioned on previous calls while we are continuing to evaluate alternatives we dont have any further updates at this time with that mark and i will be happy to answer your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from scott cavanagh of apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc good afternoon guys thanks once again for having the call two questions for you first looking at overall asset quality and earnings momentum weve seen as you and your peers said the improvement in the economy the ongoing strength in credit quality has definitely been a tailwind for bottom line earnings but when we think about the second half and going into next year how should we think about the potential continued benefit from reserve releases given your second quarter levels were still elevated to the day one albeit lower than the first quarter of mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc scott good afternoon you broke up a little bit you said how should we think about in the second half what just repeat that part again please scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc sorry potential future benefit of reserve releases given the ongoing improvement in the economy given the absolute levels are still elevated to day one theres the possibility that we go the correct levels are below that so how should we think about that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc got it great question and look youre right we have seen on the heels of we have seen the economy and the outlook improve and thats been an important factor through quarter one and quarter two as weve seen reserve releases play through weve also by the way continued to have very strong client engagement and strong underlying indicators around the prospect for a strong recovery that we feel good about as it relates to your question specifically on additional reserve releases there are a number of factors that come into play there so one is the continued outlook for the macroeconomic indicators how gdp how unemployment is likely to evolve the second is how the portfolio mix changes and as you know we are starting to invest in bringing on or acquiring new customer accounts and reactivating card activity with customers and so thats going to be a factor as loan balances begin to build and then the last factor would be kind of the downside scenario that we assume as we run these different cecl models that we have and so hard to say with precision where this ends up for the year the way the indicators have been evolving i would expect that we would see additional reserve releases but hard to call that precisely in terms of where we started on day one whether thats the longterm level those factors come into play again so what the portfolio looks like relative to what it looked like then the outlook on the economy et cetera et cetera citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc okay and my followup question is on the issuance front what are your current plans for future agreements you entered the affordable housing bond with great success and then could you elaborate on the recent icma debate about looking at the lookback period thats commonplace in the us green and sustainable bonds and the potential for rolling your longterm assets within that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure scott hi there its mike look so we were happy with the programs that we brought in esg both green and affordable housing thats an area thats obviously important to the firm were going to continue to explore opportunities to issue in that space of course as i think about the issuance for the year and what weve done so far and what we have left to do its a limited amount but of course well continue to explore opportunities talk with our investors and really determining what the need is both across tenors currencies as well as types including esg operator your next question is from hima inguva of bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you very much and as usual mark mike and tom thanks a lot for doing the call mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc we appreciate it so my first question is around china with all the regulatory crackdowns that are being talked about if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on exposure in china considering youve announced plans to exit retail banking in asia that would be very helpful mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure hi hima how are you thanks for joining look as you would imagine we continue to monitor that situation very closely while we have announced that were exiting retail banking in asia we are continuing our very strong performance in our icg businesses around the world were not exiting any countries out of our icg business and as such we continue to serve our multinational companies and our local champions through this icg business that we have and we dont anticipate any impact from some of the chinese regulatory crackdowns as you characterize them that have been in the press as of late citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 our total exposure in china which we do disclose in our 10q so its out there in our first quarter 10q is approximately billion and that includes about billion of funded loans and about billion of funded loans out of our consumer business hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you very much for clarifying that and the second question is around your perhaps issuance needs maybe if you could elaborate on how we should think about it remainder of the year considering all the changes that were made this year michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure hi hima so no immediate need as you know we would typically depending on market conditions get out in front of the call opportunities that we have if it was economical but we dont have calls for quite some time so its really now about how our balance sheet evolves and that of course is going to be a function of overall economic activity and then of course markets are favorable so we will consider that too so as always we leave ourselves room to be opportunistic and well take that into account and look at how the balance sheet evolves but again nothing thats going to be driven by calls just given we dont have anything in the near future here operator your next question is from arnold kakuda of bloomberg intelligence arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research great thanks for holding the call guys really appreciate it so it seems like reading from the press it seems like youve reinstated a mask mandate in the us so just curious in terms of if you have maybe some more insights from your global footprint where theres been the delta variant has kind of been more of an issue versus the us so is that kind of what you guys are seeing or is it just more response to the cdc updated guidance mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure arnold good to hear from you we obviously have a global footprint and frankly we are handling this pandemic as the local environments that we operate in would require and so every market every country we handle uniquely based on the data and not on any targeted date for when we want to get back into the office or when you should or shouldnt wear a mask and so in the case of what youve read recently it is in response to what everyones seeing come out of the cdc we obviously want to adhere to the guidance that they provide and whats most important is ensuring the safety of our employee base and so well continue to be led by data whether its data around returning to the office or data around wearing face mask or whatever because thats the right thing to do arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg lp research citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 got it thank you and then moving on to issuance so it seems like youre lower than peer issuance has helped your bonds outperform peers this year and then you further kind of moved your target to the lower end of the range so im just curious in terms of weve seen some of your peers have elevated issuance if i can put it into two buckets one maybe where the balance sheet expanded a lot during the pandemic and so maybe with the slr relief going away then youd issue some other in other cases an opportunity opening up in prime brokerage so peers aggressively going after that market share so where do you guys kind of fit within that are there other things that you guys are able to do to kind of offset some of these increased issuance pressures that maybe others have had michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure arnold so when we think about issuance and weve always talked about this we like to maintain a lot of flexibility and we do that by ensuring we have multiple funding levers at our disposal both in the bank and in the nonbank just starting off with the bank clearly weve seen deposit growth over the past year and so the need for any bank issuance really is diminished just given that good deposit growth that weve seen and obviously thats an activity where its a funding source but its also accommodating our client need when you think about the nonbank its similar that we have different funding sources of course we have financing activities but we also maintain a commercial paper program we have our client note program in addition to of course our parent benchmark now in terms of need as youve seen with tlac even after the expiration of the temporary relief we end the quarter roughly billion which is just about double where our targeted range had been and if you look at our liquidity levels weve maintained good liquidity levels as well and so when you think about the need that weve had and how weve been funding especially our nonbank positions we did use some of that liquidity in the quarter to fund that need but at the same time we saw good client engagement in our note program and keep in mind that note program is really a client facilitation activity so it has the benefit of meeting our client needs while at the same time providing us funding which is attractive because its a diverse investor base its retail and high net worth clients and again its a diversification from our parent benchmark program and of course we still over the course of the year and in the quarter did come to the market for that parent program and so really its about having the flexibility to source funding from different avenues and as i said weve been in a good liquidity position same with tlac and so that has afforded us the flexibility to really optimize our sources of funding while meeting our client needs you mentioned prime brokerage and of course obviously our resources are going to be supporting our clients and of course we then turn to what is the most optimal way to fund those positions and thats of course what i just described mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id add obviously is in the equities space in particular weve seen very good progress straight through the second quarter here were focused on getting the most out of the resources that weve dedicated to citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 the business overall were up almost versus the second quarter last year and prime and delta one are up similar levels and so good strength there good client balanced growth there and as mike suggests were well positioned to fund the opportunities as they present themselves as we do more with our clients operator your final question is from robert smalley of ubs robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks very much for taking my questions and thanks for doing the call two different questions first on asset quality were all waiting for loan growth were starting to see some of the beginnings of it but number one are you concerned about the competitive environment at all and number two given that corporations and consumers need to be in relatively good shape are we setting ourselves up for an adverse selection type of scenario where the first borrowers are the ones that really have needs second question on deposits you had big deposit growth last year not so much in the first half could you break that down a little bit corporate versus consumer what youre doing there to put a lid on deposit growth and are you doing that with a view toward the slr or is the slr just a coincidental indicator off the back of that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so why dont i get started on the loans piece robert thanks for the question and then ill touch on the deposit question and im sure mike will want to add in on that as well so look in the second quarter we did return to sequential growth and we saw that particularly in the icg business in the private bank in our trade loans or with our trade loans in tts and parts of our markets business and we started to see as well increased spend in our north america branded cards business and feel pretty good about growth in loans playing out toward the end of the year as it relates to the cards business and in part thats because of what were seeing in the way of the trend in payment rates while theyre still high we think theyre going to trend in the direction that would support some loan growth at the end of the year but also the activity that were ginning up with the marketing dollars that were putting to work around bringing on or acquiring new balances and so we feel good about the prospect of loan growth toward the end of the year we also feel good about the underwriting that weve done many of these customers weve had for a long time we know the behavior patterns of those customers we know that we have customers that are in a temporary transactor state so to speak and so as the stimulus starts to wind down we would expect they will revert back to revolving activity and that will drive those loan balances and this is a portfolio both on the branded cards business as well as the retail services business and i stress that because you have a mix of behavior that plays out when you have a portfolio of the size that we have and so we do feel good about the prospect of loan growth obviously the recovery and the pacing of that will be an important factor but the trends were seeing in gdp forecast the trends were seeing in unemployment forecasts all support that that should play through and that we should be well positioned to capture the benefit of that loan growth citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure and on deposits clearly we saw as the federal reserve putting a lot of liquidity in the system the industry deposit rates growing quite rapidly but from our perspective clearly we have ample deposits to fund our growth just based on what our need is now obviously weve been deploying some of that excess liquidity into securities but also id say its not about the absolute level of deposits were working with our clients in meeting their needs as well as looking at the value of those deposits and looking at the returns as well as the liquidity value associated with that activity if i think about consumer we saw strong deposit growth there particularly in the us which allows us to continue to execute on our strategy our overall consumer deposits were up on the year and when you look at north america consumer that was up and within that checking balances were up so were very much focused on the types of deposits that were taking in as well and if you look at our broader businesses and our institutional business we continue to grow deposits there as well securities services again thats been driven by higher assets under custody and if you look at private banking we continued to grow and deepen those relationships as well in tts down slightly but that is also a function of optimizing that deposit base in the context of the overall client relationship so its really about focusing on meeting our client needs and really being thoughtful about how we take in those deposits and the value of those deposits in terms of their deployment mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id add to that mike is that so youre right relationship being the key word there and thats how we think about managing the deposit growth and momentum that weve seen and thats critically important the deposit levels to the other part of your question the deposit levels do put pressure on the gsib score they do put pressure on slr and the regulators have referenced the importance of maintaining capital levels throughout the industry so to speak and so were hopeful that their continued focus on the implications of this excess liquidity thats in the market and these deposit levels and what they mean for these important factors that they continue to focus on that and that that plays out in a way that allows them to maintain their objective of balanced or maintain capital levels robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thats great thats very helpful thank you and thanks for doing the call mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call fixed income 30jul2021 operator we did have another question come in from kevin maloney of blackrock kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc thanks for having this call guys its greatly appreciated on the card portfolio have you increased marketing expenses or developed new programs it seems like some of your competitors are beginning to go that route and also the corporate card which i believe is mostly in asia is that going to be sold when you sell the businesses and lastly i think theres about billion of loans in asia in the card portfolio can i just assume thats all going to go away when the business is sold mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so let me try and take those so first we have increased our marketing and acquisition spend as it relates to cards as we see the recovery start to take hold and you can see that referenced in our supplement which speaks to that expense very explicitly weve also kind of looked at and launched i should say additional products our cashback card is out there to attract new customers that kind of respond to those types of rewards but weve also kind of continued our efforts around flex pay and flex loan which also will generate interest almost immediately as those balances grow and so we are actively engaged with acquiring new balances as i mentioned earlier in terms of the corporate card which i think was your second question the corporate card is part of our tts platform which is part of our icg business and so as i mentioned earlier while were exiting asia consumer businesses or markets were not exiting any of our icg business activity in asia and that would include our commercial card activity which is part of that tts franchise kevin james maloney q analyst blackrock advisors llc okay good so the billion thats in asia some of that will obviously be retained is that the takeaway i should get from that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so as i mentioned earlier i gave china as an example there are consumer loans of about billion that we have funded there that would be part of whatever exits we make out of that market and that would be true for the consumer balances that we have in the other countries the other markets that weve referenced and so thats kind of as those exits occur over time we would expect that to move along with it operator that concludes the questionandanswer session mr rogers do you have any closing remarks thomas rogers headfixed income investor relations citigroup inc id just like to thank everyone for attending the call and of course
