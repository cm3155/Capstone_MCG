financial performance highlights and some other business developments and hand it over to emily to review the results in more detail but first i wanted to spend a minute discussing the environment in which were all operating as i reflect on the past year the word that keeps coming to mind for me is resilience the resilience of our business model our global financial infrastructure and of course our clients and our employees indeed we saw the resilience of the financial system itself due to the lessons learned from the previous financial crises and to the quick and decisive action from the government and regulators and now were moving from a period of resilience to a period that we are all optimistic will be one of recovery and growth while we all remain cleareyed about the challenges that still exist im one of many business leaders who have seen many reasons to be positive in the period ahead when we move pass the covid cloud the optimism stems from the confluence of several factors including the deployment of the vaccine potential strength from consumers now in the us households have been saving at extraordinary levels currently the savings rate is running about and thats more than twice the 30year average the amount held in cash in household and available for spending is around of gdp which is way above normal times in addition monetary stimulus and further us government spending plans are likely to accelerate gdp growth so we expect significant gdp growth going the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 forward assuming the pandemic is managed as expected the strong economy is likely to keep activity and asset levels high and expectations for stronger growth is beginning to be reflected in the steepening of the curve now i also wanted to touch on the future of work and general productivity the pandemic has driven remarkable levels of innovation and technology adoption and companies have now become accustomed to the new way of working weve proven our ability to maintain highquality service for our clients adopt and deploy new technologies quickly weve collaborated with one another virtually over this past year were going to take the best of what weve learned to continue to innovate and drive enhanced value for our clients and our employees including assessing what our workforce and workplaces will look like we intend to embrace hybrid working arrangements we define future of work that continues to position us as an employer of choice in our industry now with that let me turn to some highlights on our performance where we see momentum across our businesses starting on slide we reported revenue of billion fee revenue excluding the impact of money market fee waivers increased yearoveryear against the prior year quarter that had exceptional pandemic related volume and volatility asset servicing and pershing particularly benefited from healthy client activity as well as market appreciation operating margin of is relatively flat yearoveryear not bad considering the significant loss in interest rate revenue we had a credit provision release of million eps of was down from last year and return on tangible common equity of turning to our businesses now the strength in asset servicing revenue reflects higher markets robust client volumes and continued new business momentum our open architecture strategy and platforms continue to gain traction with clients powered by our data and analytics solutions in the first quarter a large global asset manager in acquisition mode signed a multiyear agreement for data vault thats our cloudbased platform the vault allow their clients to integrate acquisitions quickly and easily interact with data to gain actionable insights to help drive their business decisions we are proud to have been selected by gabelli funds to launch its new actively managed etf and thats an esgthemed product and to have been named etf service provider for first trust skybridges bitcoin etf trust in the first quarter our etf servicing platform launched a record ph funds and our etf assets under custody andor administration has now surpassed trillion we recently also announced the establishment of a new digital assets unit which is building a multiasset platform that will allow us to custody traditional as well as digital assets including cryptocurrencies in an integrated way the growing client demand for digital assets and improved regulatory clarity presents an opportunity for us to extend our current service offerings over time to this emerging field moving to pershing and clearing and collateral management pershing benefited from continued elevated transaction volumes equity market strength and strong underlying fundamentals as i mentioned last quarter we did lose a couple of clients due to consolidation and this together with the low rate environment will impact pershing in and mask the underlying good organic fee growth in clearing and collateral management clearing fees remain strong and we expect healthy activity going forward within collateral management international fees were buoyant due to new business wins in addition as we announced earlier this week we now accept chinese bond as collateral on our triparty platform through hong kongs bond connect the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 with the chinese fixed income market only expected to grow demand has been mounting for such a solution which until now has not existed this is another example of bny mellons continued innovation to drive value to our clients now turning to investment and wealth management we recently announced the realignment of mellons capabilities in fixed income equity and multiasset and liquidity management with insight newton and dreyfus cash respectively this will enhance the scale and capabilities of our specialist firms and strengthen their research platforms operations as well as global reach we had a year of consistent quarterly longterm inflows and investment performance across our top strategies continues to be strong in wealth management higher markets helped to drive client assets to a record level of almost billion weve implemented many positive changes in this business including new sales teams a broader investment and banking offering and new digital capabilities for clients we were gratified by very high satisfaction stores in our yearend client survey with all survey categories up year overyear now our proprietary goalsbased planning tool advicepath was recently named a cio award winner this award recognizes technology teams across industries that are driving growth through digital transformation so a lot has been happening to build momentum for growth with existing and new clients moving beyond financial performance i want to spend a minute on esg something that is top of mind for our investors employees and our clients we are committed to ensuring that we use our reach market influence and resources to address pressing esg issues our goals include offering our clients leading analytical solutions empowering esg investors with new investment strategies and encouraging and enabling esg financing last month we published our first report on how were managing the impacts of climate change on our business prepared in accordance with the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures or tcfd guidelines i encourage you to read it as it includes examples of where we have initiatives in place related to climate risks and opportunities and laid down multiyear metrics and targets including plans to enhance disclosure around how were doing our part to healthy environment now let me close with where i opened the year started with continued extraordinary efforts by the us government and federal reserve to address the economic fallout of the pandemic through fiscal and monetary stimulus much uncertainty remains but equity markets have been generally optimistic although somewhat volatile and longerterm treasury yields have steepened but the amount of liquidity in the system and inflows into money market funds have driven shortterm rates lower in some cases even negative so there are many positive factors that support our business model but shortterm rates continue to be a challenge our business has proven to be resilient and were well poised for organic growth moreover we continue to bring innovative solutions to the market to help our clients to help them grow with that ill hand it over to emily to review our results in more detail emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd and good morning everyone i will walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 beginning on page of the financial highlights document in the first quarter of we reported revenue of billion and eps of this includes the impact of the reserve release of about per share partially offset by a million renewable energy investment impairment of about per share revenue was down and eps was down as expected results were negatively impacted by continued low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers and the absence of share repurchase activity for most of fee revenue excluding fee waivers grew driven by market levels good organic growth and the positive impact of a weaker us dollar while client activity was down slightly versus the exceptional coviddriven volumes and balances experienced a year ago it was stronger than we had anticipated as a reminder last quarter we guided to about organic growth for the year in this quarter organic growth was greater than beginning this quarter we reclassified a few revenue line items which drives cleaner and simpler reporting basically we took investment and other income out of our fee revenue and created a new reporting line which includes investment and other income as well as other trading variable interest entities and securities gains and losses the reclassifications had no impact on total revenue and the details can be found on pages and of the financial supplement prior periods have also been reclassified foreign exchange revenue had a strong quarter up versus the fourth quarter primarily on the back of high volumes and was lower versus an exceptional prior year net interest revenue was down expenses increased yearoveryear which was a bit higher than prior guidance due to higher revenuerelated expenses higher litigation costs and the appreciation of our stock price associated with equity awards as previously disclosed first quarter of also benefited from an accrual adjustment that was not repeated in provision for credit losses was a release of million primarily reflecting an improved macro outlook and cre price index we had net recoveries of million and our portfolio remains high quality with approximately of loans rated investment grade at march pretax margin of was relatively flat to last year which is a strong outcome considering the impact of the low interest rate environment on fee waivers and nir both of which have de minimis expenses associated with them roe was and rotce was page sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results and is adjusted for notable items for the fourth quarter of where indicated investment services revenue was billion down yearonyear the decline was primarily a result of lower net interest revenue fee waivers and lower fx revenue these headwinds ph map benefits from higher client volumes liquidity balances market levels and a weaker us dollar investment services fee and other revenue exwaivers was up investment and wealth management revenue increased as higher market value modest equity investment gains compared to losses a year ago and a weaker us dollar offset the impact from fee waivers money market fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense were million in the quarter compared to the million guidance that weve provided previously the higher than expected waivers were driven by higher balances the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 turning to page our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums common equity tier capital totaled about billion as of march and our cet1 ratio was under both the advanced and standardized approaches tier leverage was down basis points from the fourth quarter primarily due to high deposits we continue to monitor the impact of liquidity in the system on our balance sheet we will continue to support our clients cash management needs while at the same time managing our tier leverage ratio which is our binding constraint over the last year excess deposits have grown substantially taking the unprecedented environment into consideration we are comfortable utilizing a portion of our internal buffer that we maintain for the tier leverage ratio and therefore could go below for a period of time finally our lcr was flat compared to the fourth quarter at in terms of shareholder capital returns we purchased million of common stock in the first quarter in line with the federal reserves modified limitations that apply to all ccar banks and continue to pay our quarterly dividend which totaled million this past quarter turning to page my comments on net interest revenue will highlight sequential changes q1 net interest revenue was down with about twothirds of the decline driven by the impact of lower interest rates and the other onethird driven by other items such as day count and hedging activity as a reminder although average deposits increased again this quarter they had minimal nir value in the current low shortterm rate environment turning to page which summarizes deposits and securities trends as mentioned deposit balances continued to grow and on average were up billion or from the fourth quarter and up billion or from a year ago as was the case in the fourth quarter again in q1 a larger driver of the growth was excess liquidity in the system driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus turning to the securities portfolio on average the portfolio was flat to the fourth quarter and up approximately billion or over the prior year within the securities portfolio we do continue to invest in nonhqla securities primarily in nonagent cmbs munis and investmentgrade corporate bonds as we look to improve yield while maintaining our conservative risk profile we also continue to grow the loan portfolio opportunistically such as in act lending and other margin lending as well as capital call financing page provides an overview on expenses which we largely covered earlier turning to page as mentioned earlier total investment services revenue yearonyear declined by due to the impact of low interest rates on nir and fee waivers and lower fx compared to the strong yearago quarter nir was down fee and other revenue exwaivers was up fx revenue in investment services had a strong quarter up from the fourth quarter and down yearoveryear as higher client volumes partially offset normalization of spreads and volatility assets under custody andor administration increased yearoveryear to trillion on the back of higher market values and client inflows the favorable impact of weaker us dollar and net new business as i move to the business line discussion im going to focus my comments on fees asset servicing fees were up slightly excluding fee waivers primarily reflecting higher client activity and higher market levels partially offset by lower fx revenue to a comparably high period last year the pipeline remains strong and winloss ratios continue to improve the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 pershing had another strong quarter despite the impact of fee waivers while fees were down they would have been up excluding fee waivers yearoveryear clearing accounts were up mutual fund assets were up and we saw continued strong net new asset flows of billion in the quarter transactional activity remains robust with average daily clearing revenue up about from the fourth quarter although we do expect this to normalize as we move through issuer services fees decreased mostly driven by fee waivers and covidrelated dividend fee impact in dr treasury services fees were up modestly exwaivers on the back of higher payment volumes and higher money market fund balances and a continued shift to higher margin products clearance and collateral management fees were down slightly primarily due to elevated volume in the yearago quarter continued organic growth in our nonus business where triparty balances and clearing fees increased was offset by slight declines in us volumes and lower intraday financing fees page summarizes the key drivers that affect the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses turning to investment and wealth management on page as noted earlier total investment and wealth management revenue in the quarter increased overall assets under management held steady compared to the fourth quarters record trillion and were up yearoveryear primarily due to higher market value the positive impact of a weaker us dollar and net inflows investment management revenue grew in spite over basis points negative impact from fee waivers as the benefit of higher market levels equity investment gains in the current quarter compared to losses a year ago and a weaker dollar more than offset lower performance fees against a strong yearago quarter in the first quarter we had net inflows of billion including our fourth straight quarter of longterm inflows of billion driven by strong inflows in ldi and fixed income as well as index funds investment performance remains strong with more than of our top strategies having peer rankings ranked in the top two quartiles on a threeyear basis up from a year ago wealth management revenues were up on the back of higher market client assets grew to a record billion and were up yearoveryear primarily due to high market values and inflows nonmortgage loans and client deposits are also up now turning to the other segment on page the yearoveryear revenue comparison was primarily impacted by the impairment of one renewable energy investment as noted earlier the expense increase primarily reflected incentive comp accrual reversals in the year ago quarter a few comments about the outlook as we think about the balance of for nir our full year guidance remains unchanged this implies nir on a full year basis will be down around to compared to with regard to waivers using the forward curve to project just like we do for nir we expect waivers net of distribution and servicing expense to be around million for the second quarter this will have a modest negative impact to revenues of approximately million due to lower rates partially offset by higher balances so for the second half of the year we do expect to be more in line with the first quarter with regards to fees exwaivers the growth rate in the first quarter was significantly higher than previous full year guidance due to higher volume but we expect those volumes to moderate going forward regarding expenses the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 we previously guided to be up about excluding notable items given the higher expenses this quarter we now expect them to be up about as a reminder on a constant currency basis we guided that we will be flat yearonyear and that will now be up about basis points finally in terms of our effective tax rate we still expect it to be approximately for however we are monitoring the latest federal tax proposal closely in terms of shareholder capital returns we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend and will once again make open market share repurchases in compliance with the federal reserves modified limitations which will allow us to repurchase approximately million of common stock in the second quarter looking beyond the second quarter the federal reserves latest communication to ccar banks indicated that they will likely implement the scb framework for capital management in the third quarter so we are following that guidance closely we look forward to receiving the results of this years stress test and operating under the stress capital buffer framework which will allow for more flexibility and should mean that we can return more than of earnings to shareholders starting in the third quarter with that operator can you please open up the line for questions question and answer section operator of course thank you operator instruction and our first question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question i was hoping to ask actually emily about some of those comments on capital and fed returning to the scb approach which allows for capital returns the tier leverage ratio is now inside your guided band with a buffer of to i believe you all have referenced that you have leverage to pull which might help on that front so could you maybe walk us through some of those dynamics and then also how rigid is that buffer that youve applied it seems to be a bit above peers and so would you or are you in a position where you could allow yourselves to go underneath that buffer for a period of time given the unusual growth in deposits emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thanks for the question so we are very managing our deposits very closely having said that we will absolutely continue to support our clients with our balance sheet and were comfortable with where deposits are now but of course it goes without saying over the course of the last months there have been a lot of additional reserves in the system liquidity in the system and so weve seen a surge in those deposits a large portion of that surge is excess so its nonoperational weve been very successfully working with our clients to basically explore and move some of those non operational deposits to offbalance sheet vehicles thankfully we have a good platform in liquidity direct that has lots of alternatives thats an open platform so that has been very effective the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 you are correct in pointing out as i did mention in my prepared remarks that given the unprecedented liquidity in the system we would feel comfortable dipping into our tier leverage buffer we do hold a very significant buffer in excess of basis points over reg minimums we size that very carefully its basically to both absorb any impact to oci given rate changes as well as also the any surge in balances and given thats really what weve seen and the buffer is really there for this particular kind of unprecedented environment ultimately we would feel comfortable dipping below the for a period of time of course running certainly above the regulatory minimum brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc right okay that helps thats great to hear and then one other question on the balance sheet it seemed as though the interestbearing asset growth lagged deposit growth this quarter on an average basis right just looking at the ph average balance sheet was that because some of those deposits may be temporary maybe you all were in the process of encouraging some folks to consider offbalance sheet options like referenced therefore when we gauge balance sheet growth here this quarter we should more pay attention which one should we pay attention to more which one is more indicative is it the interestearning asset growth or is it deposit growth and or is it just that youll be putting more money to work therefore the interestearning asset growth will catch up i just wasnt it seemed a big gap so i wasnt sure about that thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean sure so certainly and i think i just mentioned a significant portion of the deposit growth that weve seen we do think is excess and so nonoperational so its very hard to really redeploy that into the securities portfolio or the loan portfolio for any real duration so as a result a lot of that is just sitting at the fed earning basis points which obviously is dilutive to nim but of course it is overall accretive to nir just obviously marginally so so when we think about just nir in general we really just use the forward curve to project and despite of course the steepening of the long end of the curve we did see the short end grind lower and also the duration of the curve where we invest is more in the two to fiveyear mark and that didnt go up as much as the long end but of course to the extent the curve does continue to steepen andor shift upwards that will be extraordinarily helpful brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the color operator and we will take our next question from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc very good thanks good morning folks can you hear me the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes brian we can hear you brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc very good and thanks just one more on the rate sensitive and net interest revenue and fee waivers just the cadence as they move through the year really into second quarter and back a little bit to that deposit strategy with the excess deposits is there an ability to put a little bit more on the securities portfolio as we move into the second quarter so what im trying to get at is given your full year guidance are we at sort of stability as you see it coming into the second quarter on nir or is it maybe another dip down before we go up and then similar to that on the fee waiver i think you said million for the second quarter but then im not sure if i got this correct that you thought that was going to improve in the back half and that was based on balances can you clarify that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily you want to take that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so in terms of nir we dont really give ultimately quarterbyquarter balances and so much of it is dependent upon or quarterbyquarter projections and so much of it is dependent upon obviously the rate curve deposit levels and mbs prepayment and other factors all of which are baked into our projections and what i would say as i just reconfirmed is that our full year projection for nir is still the same as the original guidance given which is or down yearonyear so that hasnt changed fully in terms of waivers so waivers are a function of two things basically shortterm rates specifically three months and six months tbills as well as repo rates also a function of money market fund balances and actually what we saw this quarter is actually both rates grind lower balances go higher as a result waivers overall were a bit higher than originally anticipated at million they were that the total impact however was slightly positive to revenues and again just we use the forward curve to also project waivers looking at the forward curve also the historical relationship between rates and money market balances et cetera we think that waivers the size of waivers overall will peak in the second quarter at about million and then by the way that would be probably at the fees were talking about the gross yields were talking about probably slightly negative to revenues but then we would expect the second half of the year to be more in line with the first quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 and look i always like to remind people albeit its probably not until the latter half of or that if when fed funds eventually hit is when the fed moves we will recover in excess of of those waivers and when it hit the its very close to of those waivers brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc definitely thats a good color and then the second question is on organic growth you said it did tick up to this quarter maybe if you could just talk about the drivers of that i know todd you mentioned very good demand for data analytics with the data vault it sounds like that contract is not in the big one you mentioned is not in the run rate yet but maybe if you could just talk about that momentum and the organic growth rate and drivers of that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so thanks for the question brian so the first quarter we got the benefit obviously of a lot of activity hard to project exactly where that activity is going to go but the guidance i think that emily provided to you is probably not sustainable at this level but we did get some nice new wins which is reflected in that pershing volumes were particularly high very good flows in a number of their accounts so were seeing a lot of good growth with existing clients as well with balances there we do expect them as i said to moderate somewhat and i also did point out that on the previous call that we had some lost business in pershing that will impact us later this year so pershing has got pretty strong underlying organic growth to it but its going to be masked a bit by both the interest rates as well as that lost business that will impact in the second half but we are seeing sustained momentum across just about all of our business strong pipelines and so as we converted the pipeline to sales we continue to build the pipeline we have another pretty big quarter for sales our higher winloss ratios are improving and retention has continued to be good i mentioned the data vault and we had a number of clients in beta weve now signed a very significant one and building a deeper relationship with that client a lot of interest in some of our analytics and our applications that weve described to before were actually seeing recovery in payment flows too so treasury services which is largely commercial payments and lot of its global were seeing a good recovery back on economic recovery and were also picking up some market share weve got some pretty interesting opportunities there as we look forward were pretty excited what we might be able to do in the realtime payments space there assetwealth management had positive flows were seeing meaningful improvement in wealth and weve been talking about the investments that were making across the businesses both even in the core custody our middle office functions the payment system clearing and collateral management indiscernible it was off of an extraordinary good quarter last year but we continue to pick up global assets the fact that weve built up this bond connect capability in china is an exciting innovative service that were providing to clients and were confident that thats going to continue to grow so good underlying momentum helped by very strong activity in the first quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi betsy emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay a couple of questions a little bit on the technical side on the buildout that youre doing around the digital assets the cryptocurrencies and that kind of thing could you remind us the kind of pace that youre anticipating being able to roll this out and are you going to be custodying the physicals just wanted to understand what the how wide the aperture is on this opportunity set thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay sure betsy ill take it its todd so when we talk about our digital asset efforts what were talking about is digitizing traditional securities so that theyre more easily mobilized things like you can digitize the money market fund make it an eligible asset to put into repo which you couldnt do in the past and you can make it much much more efficient we think theres going to be quite a bit of that activity as well as smart contracts and what that might be able to do for the corporate trust and other businesses so thats one element of it the other thing that were going to see is we think there will be digitization of fiat currencies were already involved in a consortium with fnality which is a central bank currency which could trade in digital form and is really just developing regulatory approvals for it now so we do think there will be and there are already existing digital currencies fiat currencies and where every the thing that gets the hype is really around the cryptocurrencies that we would be digitizing excuse me we would be custodizing those as well so we have been working on a prototype and we expect to the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 be offering capabilities across all three of those by the end of the year as were building things out with clients that have shown institutional interest so yes we would actually have the wallet if you will or be the custodian for the underlying cryptocurrency or anyone of those particularly digitized assets betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so you would actually be custodying the physicals youre not going to be subcustodying that out to somebody else thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp that is not our intent at this point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then whats the timeframe for getting to market is that a or timeframe thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp we expect that youll be hearing some things towards the end of but it may be a little bit earlier for some elements of it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the other theme i wanted to just touch base on was around the climate comment that you had in your prepared remarks todd i mean part of it is asking the question what can you do is this about your own footprint or is this also about working with your clients and if its working with your clients how do you anticipate you will help them get more climatefriendly so to speak thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes so theres really two elements to it betsy one is what were doing as an enterprise our own carbon footprint for example and weve been very active we published recently in february we published a considering climate at bny mellon report which gave very specific examples of what weve done around carbon waste and other environmentalrelated activities and we are carbonneutral we have been for an extended period of time and weve been named by the cdp really one of five financial institutions that have been given an a rating on climate and were the only financial institution that have gotten that rating over the past eight years so thats what were doing as a firm in managing paper and our carbon footprint in terms of what were also doing is were providing services to clients for example were the largest trustee on green bonds and we can certainly help clients establish the trustee function that goes along with that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 but in addition in the asset servicing space one of the things that have come out of our data and analytics capability is a very interesting application on esg and allowing our clients to customize ph their views of their own portfolios and we use a crowdsourcing technique thats unique and we offer a cloudbased solution the client basically brings the license from ph their data providers were connected to data providers we got million securities in that application and theres kind of a constant feedback loop to the data providers so theyre constantly enhancing the amount of information that they might have on a particular security so were excited about that we have quite a few clients on it now and were just contracting them for permanent usage and in addition to that in our investment management space were building quite a few esg products and in the servicing space we were just awarded an attractive etf that was based on esg so it really goes in those two forms one is the commercial element that we can help our businesses and number two is just doing the right thing for our own company betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you appreciate that color thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks betsy operator our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning todd and emily hope you guys are doing well maybe another question around capital so i heard you guys obviously targeting over payout thats something that you guys have targeted for a little while as well can you help us kind of calibrate that against the significant buyback you have authorized currently obviously there could be some probably technical restrictions ph in terms of how much you could ultimately get done in the third quarter given just the volume threshold but maybe help us think through that relative to your comments and willingness to kind of go below the tier leverage so im just kind of trying to think through how much you could ultimately get done emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so ultimately you are correct in mentioning that we had approval ill just remind folks the board approval was given in the fourth quarter of last year to do buybacks up to billion through the third quarter of this year given the feds limitations on buybacks actually through the second quarter its probably going to be pretty unlikely that we could execute the entirety of billion just literally in terms of adb et cetera but we will do as much as we are allowed and assuming that the fed does return to or implement i should say the scb framework which does allow for much more flexibility we would intend to certainly execute in excess of of or return i should say in the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 excess of of earnings in the third quarter as much as we could do and anything that we couldnt do we would hope to catch up in the fourth quarter in that program alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats helpful and then maybe we can unpack some of the nir dynamics a little bit more so two questions there i guess one deposit costs i think were roughly flattish i guess sequentially just in terms of what you guys are targeting is there room for that to grind a little bit lower as youre trying to optimize the balance sheet or theres not a whole lot you guys could do in terms of pushing pricing on deposits to clients and then i wanted to clarify your comments around premium amortization i dont know if i missed it but what was it in the quarter and your full year nir guidance what does that assume for premium am for the rest of the year emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so just talking about first deposits you are right that the deposit rates are relatively flat and remember thats an average across nonus dollar as well as us dollar we are charging in for example euros and for japanese yen were not of course charging for the us in the us i mean look there i dont know if this is the trough but this is probably pretty much close to ultimately i guess the rate that we get to of course if rates actually went negative in the us we could start charging for deposits we certainly dont feel or having felt that that is necessary and ironically if you do start charging for deposits then you start to earn money earn more in nir so but that isnt the intention at the moment in terms of your second thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey emily let me just add something to that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so i think in the fed guidance alex that theyve provided they really have talked about there being means for them to limit any possibility of negative rates for any sustainable time and weve seen repo rates go negative a little bit so we do think that there are probably policy actions if that were to dip down but as we go through the as we scrub through the nature of the deposits that weve gotten and obviously theres very limited value to them now weve got a whole capital against them now we are grinding them down but theres not a whole lot more to grind down alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah and then premium the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp indiscernible emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp oh sure ph on am on the mbs prepayment speeds just in our nir projections weve already taken into account a trajectory of mbs prepayments slowing down just based upon the rise in rates so just to think about it in terms of sizing we would expect the mbs prepayment speeds to slow down by about probably to by year end alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you very much thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks alex operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi you had some good fee growth in servicing that you talked about healthy volumes that should moderate is that kind of expectations around pershing and what are you seeing pershing or retail behavior you have a window into that world ph i guess thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike ill take that so id say its a so i think its a combination of things so weve seen a lot of activity in the trading space we have seen retail activity that was very high as you know and pershing does see some of that but its been in the institutional side as well as the retail side and we would expect that to subside somewhat from the elevated levels that we saw in the first quarter what was interesting is the institutional business is probably a little more active in march and the retail business was probably a little more active in january and february mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so youre seeing a slowdown in retail trading as the quarter went on i mean as people return back to work you can say you trade less or anything related to that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp do you think their supervisors keep an eye on what theyre doing at their desks a little bit more im not sure i agree to that but its very hard to say mike because what you got to remember is there is a massive amount of the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 cash sloshing around the system and its got to go somewhere one of the things that i pointed out the savings rate doubled the national average weve got households are holding of gdp in cash theyre either going to spend it invest it or just let it lose value sitting in cash so our guess is that were probably going to see lower activity but its my guess is as good as yours mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just one last question on the fee waivers i mean your customers must love you i mean can this is i mean this is million of fee waivers in the second quarter coming up i mean hopefully youre building some longterm goodwill but shareholders dont benefit from that so i mean you said youre not going to charge for deposits or i mean what any other options there or just you just have to eat it and hope you get longterm goodwill emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so mike what i thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp indiscernible let me start emily and you can follow up on it so a lot of the excess balances is ending up in cash or even ending up in money market funds so we continue to see this cash build so even though its million of fee waivers a lot of thats just driven by excess balances that we dont think are going to be there when interest rates recover just like we think the excess reserves in the system will obviously contract that being said we do think it provides a lot of upside when the market turns around which weve reflected the last time we went through this cycle and we can earn a little bit on it still and a little bit of good news is that the fedspeak recently has been pointing to the possibility to firm things up on the shortend of the curve weve actually seen the forward rates kind of improve a little bit recently so were making the assumption that using the forward curve from a few days ago when we gave that guidance that fee waivers will be ph active by like they did during the first quarter that being said it is a significant hit to earnings we think well recover it we still ran a operating margin even with that environment and the other thing that weve done is between nir and fee waivers we think we are now at or very close to the trough and it can obviously worsen its interest rates even got a little bit lower but we think we are close to the trough and so the business model is now going to start to grow off of this level mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the only thing i just mike the only thing i just want to add to that is just remember that a large portion of those waivers are really just funds that we distribute so its where the kind of the recipient of just lower fees versus competitive waivers that were actually offering in asset management the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for that operator and our next question that comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just had a followup on the asset services fee line it was nice to see the improvement sequentially and i just wondered last quarter you had mentioned some of the bulkier repricing and kind of onetime things this quarter you mentioned that theres a little bit of elevated activity just wondering from like an outlook perspective anything we should know just about kind of the trajectory of onboarding new wins and are we kind of do we have a clear line of sight on any expected meaningful repricing this year thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily do you want to take it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so we did see a nice uptake in terms of asset servicing fees they were up actually sequentially and just of that is due to asset levels and the remaining is based on transaction volumes and transaction volumes across asset servicing all of our businesses in asset servicing was up significantly doubledigits in some cases quarteronquarter as todd alluded to we do expect that volume to moderate a bit in the second half having said that we also feel that theres very strong fundamentals across the business our pipeline is strong the average sized deals in the pipeline are bigger retention stats are very strong and were also making significant investments in the business that are resonating with clients in terms of the repricing theres nothing really structural that we observe the repricing that we did experience last quarter that was a bit lumpy was really totally tied to just a few large clients that happen to be going rfp at the same time its always been a pretty modest headwind for the business that weve been able to offset with new business retention growth with our existing clients and further efficiency ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks for that emily and then just one more balance sheet question in terms of fed accommodation the incremental deposits that flowed in and certainly seemed to land on your balance sheet how are you just anticipating changes as we go forward with potential ends to qe and how do you think your balance sheet would act versus the more traditional regional banks in terms of the retention of the deposits that have flowed in thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp do you want to take it emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so ultimately we think when we basically as the fed increases reserves we think roughly about or so ends up on our balance sheet its actually hard to tell and depend very much on the economic backdrop as i did mention we do think a large portion of the deposits that weve seen and the growth in those deposits especially in the last two quarters is excess so nonoperating and we do think that that would recede pretty quickly when interest rates start to normalize and monetary policy starts to normalize i dont know todd if you have anything to add to that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think if you go back to pre the covid event which really led to the spike weve seen something close to million of balance increases some of that was intentional as we built relationships and comes naturally with the growth in our businesses but a significant amount of that was what we call will fit into that excess definition so wed imagine probably somewhere between billion to billion of that billion increase would roll off ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks ken operator our next question that comes from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just if i think about your guidance on nii it does seem like your the implication is that nii is sort of stabilizing here and i assume that implies sort of securities yields are going to kind of hold in at current levels so if we kind of assume a static balance sheet going forward i know thats not necessarily the right way to think about it but if we assume try to isolate what could be the inflection point what level of rates i mean i think youve indicated the two to five years is important youre not going to go further out than that weve the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 had the fiveyear now at basis points moving higher do we need to see that translate into the two to three year i mean what level of rate structure should we start to see maybe yields going the other way thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp why dont i start emily and then you can add so emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp i think there are really two key elements to it jim number one is the short end of the curve so weve got a significant number of assets that are pricing off of libor or shortterm indices and once again this quarter we saw for example onemonth libor was down basis points from its average in the fourth quarter and basis points for threemonth libor so we got a that offset the benefit of the move on the longer part of the curve but the steepening out to five years we keep the duration around years so that would mean theres going to be significant assets out there that roll off and get reinvestment is helpful and it will slowly come into it but its basically been offset that benefit has been offset by what we saw in the short end of the curve james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no that makes sense i was just trying to think through assuming short rates are pretty stable from here what kind of gets what at the longer end really starts to help you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean and years because what that does is it extends the duration of the mortgagebacked securities so their yields picked up because the amortization premium declines as stuff and were constantly reinvesting as stuff gets reinvested to maintain the duration that currently exists in the portfolio it would go into higher levels so it would be helpful here emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp and jim we disclosed in the 10q just some sensitivities that might be helpful as well for you to size that james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no no i got it i just was trying to get a sense of what level of rates in the middle of the curve would be helpful but we can always talk about that offline thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 thanks jim operator and our next question that comes from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning this is michael anagnostakis on for steven just following up on the nii guide and you gave some detail around where youre deploying some of that excess liquidity from here and i appreciate the color on premium am as well maybe you could just provide some color around how much of that deployment is contemplated in the nii guide for the securities portfolio emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily do you want to take that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i mean our securities portfolio is basically flat to last quarter and we are marginally increasing our non hqla within the quarter but when i talked about the nir guidance for the full year still being about to where the rate its just based on the forward curve deposits basically remaining pretty much where they are if not coming down a bit and mbs prepayment speed slowing down so those are the key assumptions michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my question thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks steven sic michael operator our next question that comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning todd good morning emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc todd can you frame out for us when you think about your years at bank of new york the number of new products that bank of new york has introduced over the years i think of like custody of nontraditional assets as one when you think about the opportunities for this digital digitalization and the cryptocurrencies that you guys are working on that you already talked about how big can this be and again comparing it to other new ventures that youve been involved with over the years at bank of new york if you could compare that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think its early to tell i mean if you think of all the noise that bitcoin got so its still only about of gold and gold as a custodized asset is not that important frankly right so its getting a lot of hype i do think decentralized finance is coming i do think fintechs are going to be important players and i do think that we can position ourselves well and work with fintechs to build opportunities i think youre going to see it in payments i think you are going to see it in custody its hard for me to say just how big of an opportunity that is at this point it will grow i think the more important thing is that we need to give investors choice and so if they do want to mobilize assets faster we need to be able to help them to do that if they do want to be able to hold some nontraditional assets just as they went into alternatives and other things we need to be able to help them to do that and in a way that is eliminates a lot of the counterparty risk that currently exists which is high and also enables them to get reporting on a consolidated basis in valuations and so forth which is also critically important and so there are a number of etfs coming out that are cryptorelated theres obviously good underlying growth on a very small base we think its an important part of the full product capability how big it ultimately becomes i think its just a little early for me to really speculate gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see okay thank you and then second you guys talked emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the only gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc oh go ahead emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 yeah i was just going to add one little thing which is its as much about retention as it also is about new business our clients are demanding integrated capabilities across digital assets as well as traditional securities and currencies gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thank you you guys have always told us and you talked about it again today the leverage ratio is the binding constraint not the cet1 ratio you pointed out emily that it may dip down below but still well above the regulatory minimums we understand that at what point would the leverage ratio actually come into play where you would have to back away from your buybacks even though you have the cet1 ratio not a problem but at what point do you say weve got to slow it down because the leverage ratio has fallen too far down and then as part of that is the leverage ratio really linked to the qe meaning the deposit growth and should we get a tapering then we should get some relief on your balance sheet growth which maybe would help the leverage ratio as well thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah let me start emily and then you can add if you think about it we put a buffer on the leverage ratio for business as usual now this isnt for stress testing but for business as usual and that buffer really reflects the potential for a spike in deposits or a decline due to in other comprehensive income based on the marktomarket in the securities portfolio and so frankly gerard weve seen the spike in deposits and could it go up a little bit higher yeah it may but our view now is part of the reason for the buffer has already taken place and as i indicated on one of the earlier questions we probably when things start to normalize we probably have billion of runoff in deposits so thats an enormous amount an enormous impact on that ratio and also the ph coverage from the oci that has to be that high so given the fact that weve already made this spike it makes sense for us to go ahead and dip into our buffers and emily said going to a probably is not an unreasonable thing in this environment if we were in an environment where we were a year ago im not sure i would say that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the only thing i might add is just i mean even if we were like as todd just said wed be comfortable going towards but even there if youre still you would need a considerable increase in deposits there from where we are today so weve got plenty of room gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks gerard the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of rob wildhack from autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys if we could go back to the cryptocurrency and digital assets space for a second youre clearly taking a few steps forward there with the announcements you made this quarter is that because you think weve hit some kind of inflection point in that part of the market or is it just more of a natural evolution of your service thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp rob i would say its more of a natural evolution were having deep discussions working with clients the institutional side and we started to see this toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year that the institutional side was getting more and more interested in digital assets and so we started working with them for solutions across a broad part of our business robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay rob thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks two questions here one on the ph asset servicing here just an update on how the underlying pricing is with for asset levels and for transaction volumes where is do you want to take those percentages though longer term is that the mix that youre at and this would be steady state from here are you trying to get more transaction volume base just as we think how pricing trends evolve here emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp do you want me to take that todd thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure emily yeah emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 so i mean the split is just the nature of the beast and the nature of the business so its not like we are trying to move that in any direction and for pretty much years thats just really the dynamics of how were pricing in asset servicing about of the revenue stream is based on asset levels and about or so is based on transaction costs so its pretty much the norm brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and second question i mean you look at issuer services and treasury services and the revenue drivers both being impacted by interest rates above and beyond the money market fee waivers is there any way to allocate what part of those revenues are kind of driven by interest rates as we think about asset sensitivity on a goforward basis thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so both of those businesses are significant deposittaking businesses or either we take them the on balance sheet or offbalance sheet through sweeps into money market funds and so the interest rate impact its a meaningful contribution to both of them i dont think weve broken out exactly what the split is but it and its a meaningful contribution to the obviously to the operating margins because theres no expense associated with the nir what weve seen in treasury services is an intentional build in deposits over the past year as we built out those relationships and its very much related to the activity in the accounts too because there needs to be cash and accounts to make payments and theres some frictional cash that tends to come with that money market fee waiver is a little less important there but if you think about the corporate trust business what issuers will do is theyll put cash a day or two in advance of payments that need to be made on issues that were the trustee and the paying agent and typically thats value that where we get a little of that value or we sweep it into a money market fund and so thats a meaningful contributor to that business and thats where were now seeing the kind of the late stages impact of fee waivers and thats why the issuer services business was down sequentially and yearoveryear brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp but we dont break out the very specific numbers brian okay thank you for the operator and with that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp questions yeah operator go ahead the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call
