bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 ill now turn the call over to steve bradshaw steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter financial results but before we get started ill offer a few thoughts regarding the announcement earlier this month about my plans to retire march of next year after three decades with bok financial and more than seven years as president and ceo this certainly wasnt an easy decision i take a tremendous amount of pride in leading what i believe to be the best regional financial institution in the country one with a very clear focus on longterm shareholder value however im confident bokf has never been better positioned for this change our performance through the pandemic and my leadership teams resiliency and cohesiveness throughout demonstrated expertise and synergy that stems from the true hallmarks of our organization experience and collaboration over the next year ill be focusing on ensuring a smooth transition for my successor when that individual is formally named by the board in the coming months those familiar with our company know that leadership decisions are very intentional at bokf and we run the company with a longterm perspective which includes significant work on developing internal talent and i fully expect the board to name an internal successor for ceo at the appropriate time we are wellpositioned to choose a successor soon and i can reassure you that the next leader will continue the same intentional longterm shareholder focus we are known for in the meantime ill be focused on the slate of goals and objectives we developed for which will continue to improve our competitive position and our growth prospects into and beyond with that lets look at the most recent quarterly results shown on slide first quarter net income was million or per diluted share while thats down modestly from the record earnings performance last quarter the difference between the first quarter of and that of could not be more stark the key items that drove the quarter were another outstanding earnings result from our mortgage business as activity remained elevated this quarter despite rising rates the contribution from our wealth management team continues to be a differentiator for us their results were off of a consecutive record quarters in late as we had expected the improving economic outlook combined with improving credit trends allowed us to release million of our loan loss reserve and lastly expense management remains excellent as it has really throughout the past year turning to slide loan growth continues to be a challenge this quarter as our commercial and commercial real estate customers continue to pay down debt while all borrowers continue to understandably reduce leverage in the challenging economic environment we believe we are poised for growth opportunities in the latter half of as the economy continues to rebound deposit growth remains excellent up nearly linkedquarter and up nearly from the same quarter a year ago as we began to see the most recent wave of stimulus late in the quarter assets under management or in custody and our wealth management business continue to grow as the protracted lowrate environment encourages market investment for yieldseeking clients investments in equities is now of our total assets under management or in custody and thats up approximately billion from year bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 end which positions us to materially grow fees in our fiduciary and asset management business ill provide additional perspective on the results before the start of the qa session but now stacy kymes will review the loan portfolio our credit metrics and our key fee businesses in more detail ill turn the call over to stacy stacy c kymes executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp thanks steve turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion down for the quarter as we continue to see borrowers reduced leverage as expected in early line utilization in the overall portfolio has dropped from precovid to at the end of the first quarter this year with the largest declines occurring in the energy healthcare and general ci portfolios where cumulative line utilization is down from precovid to today as the economy continues to reopen we feel confident that line utilizations will normalize and our positive outlook for loan growth will materialize later this year over the long term weve always grown our loans at to times the normal rate of gdp growth and we believe our competitive position will continue to serve us well once macroeconomic factors stabilize looking at the energy portfolio balances contracted for the quarter while commodity prices have continued to improve and stabilize sourcing new deals sufficient to offset paydowns in the current environment remains a challenge as existing borrowers continue to reduce leverage despite these factors we remain optimistic for lending and energyrelated revenue opportunities as we continue to support our customers in the space this industry vertical provides a great example of how we manage the bank to longterm economic outcomes as opposed to shortterm optics during the first quarter we recognized a million gain on energy property sales from an equity interest we received as part of a workout in this most recent downturn we have consistently indicated a willingness to own foreclosed assets while the shortterm impact of this was higher nonperforming levels we held the assets until such time the market had improved and thus were in a position to provide a full economic recovery on this loan healthcare balances were largely unchanged this quarter as a pocket of growth in senior housing loans was offset by a decrease in hospital system loans looking forward we remain confident in our healthcare portfolios longterm growth and credit outlook and expect it to return to its status as a growth leader for us as health and economic conditions migrate to a more normal state later this year ppp loan balances increased million or nearly and represent of total loans we originated million of new ppp loans this quarter maintaining our strategy of focusing on our existing client base to ensure timely support of our existing client needs growth from new originations this quarter was partially offset by paydowns of the first round of loans forgiveness activity from previous rounds of ppp were slower in the ph first quarter than our expectations the net interest revenue impact was about million less than we anticipated this should just move into future periods when the forgiveness occurs looking ahead we remain optimistic in our outlook for loan growth in the latter half of this year once these unprecedented levels of liquidity normalize the speed of vaccine distributions and the resulting broader bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 economic recovery today leads us to believe confidence and result in capital investment will return to the us economy later this year turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to be a clear differentiator for bokf we saw a meaningful credit quality improvement across the broader loan portfolio with below expectation chargeoffs and criticized asset levels this quarter this coupled with the nearterm stability in commodity prices and dramatically improving economic metrics led us to release million in reserves this quarter net chargeoffs were down from million or basis points annualized net of ppp loans in the fourth quarter to million or basis points annualized net of ppp loans this quarter net chargeoffs totaled basis points net of ppp loans over the last four quarters at the lower end of our historic loss range the combined allowance for loan losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at quarter end excluding triple ppp loans the combined allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was of outstanding energy loans on march nonaccruing loans decreased significantly down million from last quarter primarily due to a reduction in nonaccruing energy loans potential problem loans totaled million at quarter end down significantly from million on december the 31st almost all potential problem loan classes were down compared to the prior quarter led by potential problem energy and general business loans looking ahead from a credit perspective there is still a degree of uncertainty in the current environment so it remains difficult to predict that said based on what we know today and assuming our economic forecast is in line as we advance we believe net chargeoffs will remain consistent with our experience over the last months we will continue to set our reserve at the appropriate level as we always have we are generally positive about the credit outlook for the remainder of the year allowing us to continue to release this quarter once we have more clarity around the spread of covid19 case count reductions vaccine distribution and a broad resumption of regular economic activity in we could potentially see additional opportunities for reserve release this year turning to slide you can see the brokerage and trading fee revenues are down this quarter when looking at fee income and net interest income generated from our brokerage and trading business comprehensively the business is down about million linkedquarter this is largely due to some reversion from record volumes in the third and fourth quarters and compressing margins in the mortgage industry that impacted trading margins by about basis points compared to the last quarter in addition customer hedging revenue decreased million primarily due to a modest decrease in energy customer hedging activities from the record fourth quarter investment banking revenue decreased million mainly due to timing of loan syndication activity while the net interest revenue and trading revenue related to our enhanced mortgage trading desk experienced a slowdown from the record levels in as expected it is still a major contributor to the overall success of the company and is still up over from the same quarter a year ago mortgage banking revenue decreased roughly million linkedquarter but remained strong despite a national lack of housing inventory and rising interest rates while margins have thinned relative to the historic levels in the summer of they remained roughly above where they were in march of total production volume this quarter remained consistent with prior quarters and looking ahead inventory constraints could continue to bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 build a case for these elevated production levels to be sustainable as it will take a while before inventory is materially improved other revenue increased million this quarter due to higher revenue from repossessed oil and gas properties although not included on slide i will also note that net economic changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges were positive million during the quarter ill now turn the call over to steven to highlight our nim dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide first quarter net interest revenue was million down about million from last quarter while the poor yields on our loan portfolio were relatively stable a reduction in average loan volumes and the timing of loan fees including a million decline in ppp fees linkedquarter was a drag on net interest revenues this quarter net interest margin was down basis points from the previous quarter lower average outstanding loan balances coupled with the reinvestment of cash flows from our availableforsale securities portfolio continue to impact net interest margin with the portfolio yield declining basis points to additionally while we did have success driving interestbearing deposit costs down slightly to basis points this was at a decrease pace from previous quarters while there are many moving parts to consider including the continued recognition of ppp interest and fees the combination of continued repricing of the afs portfolio and the limited room to move interestbearing deposit costs down further will continue to impact net interest margin in the coming quarters turning to slide expense management remains prudent with total expenses down linkedquarter personnel expense was down million or nearly this quarter cashbased incentive compensation decreased million primarily due to decreased brokerage activity mentioned earlier deferred compensation which is largely offset by a decrease in the valuerelated investments included in other gains and losses decreased million employee benefits increased million primarily due to a seasonal increase in payroll taxes and retirement plan expenses also were very happy with our ability to hold the personnel costs efficiencies earned through the pandemic even with medical expenses increasing million yearoveryear as employees now seek wellness and other treatments deferred in nonpersonnel expense was down nearly million or from the fourth quarter half of this decrease was due to a million gain on the sale of equity interest received as part of the workout of a defaulted energy loan partially offset by additional expense and writedown of a set of oil and gas properties in the first quarter the remaining decrease in nonpersonnel expense was due to a decrease in business promotion expense of million a decrease of million in professional fees and services a decrease of million in recruiting expense and a decrease in occupancy and equipment of million partially offset by an increase of million spent on ongoing technology projects additionally we made a million charitable contribution to the bokf foundation in the quarter as we continue to focus on the communities we serve and the extreme needs created by the pandemic bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 on slide our liquidity position remains very strong given the continued inflow of deposit balances our loan to deposit ratio is now below compared to nearly at yearend providing significant onbalance sheet liquidity to meet future customer needs our capital levels remain strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well ahead of our internal operating range minimum with such a strong capital level we once again were active with share repurchase opportunistically repurchasing  at an average price of per share in the open market on slide ill leave you with a general outlook for the near and midterm we believe net activity in loan growth will slowly accelerate in tandem with the broader economic recovery this year excluding the impact of ppp our availableforsale securities portfolio which is largely agency mortgagebacked securities yielded during the first quarter given the sustained lowrate environment prepayments could reach approximately million per quarter we can currently reinvest those cash flows at rates around basis points to basis points at basis points we believe we believe we are close to the bottom in deposit pricing the combination of securities reinvestment at lower rates and minimal room to further lower deposit costs will push net interest margin lower in the coming quarters our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue pressure being felt in our spread businesses we expect most fee revenue categories to grow modestly in with the exception of brokerage and trading and mortgage businesses as the record year in those areas will be difficult to replicate as weve mentioned late last year we will continue our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and nonpersonnel costs with growth budgeted at low singledigits in our focus will be holding the line on manageable expenses without sacrificing multi year technology commitments to improve customer service and our competitive position if the economy continues to improve and we get further oil price stability this year additional loan loss reserve release is possible as i mentioned a moment ago we feel good about our capital strength we will continue looking for share buyback opportunities and well maintain our current quarterly cash dividend level we intend to bring all our employees back to the office by the end of the second quarter given improving health metrics and the wide vaccine availability ill now turn the call back over to steve bradshaw for closing commentary steven glen bradshaw president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you steven all told it was a solid quarter for bok financial our mortgage and wealth management businesses while down on a quarterly comparison continue to offer a significant offset to the depressed loan demand that plagued the industry and presenting a differentiated shareholder value for our company credit quality outcomes this quarter are a testament to not only how well weve managed the ongoing crisis but more importantly our ability to remain disciplined with credit decisions in more favorable parts of the cycle we agree with most forecasts that we are on the cusp of a period of rapid economic growth heading into the latter half of this year and we believe that will translate to loan growth an area bokf has never been better positioned to take advantage of than it is today in the near term as steven mentioned in his outlook we intend to bring all employees back to the office by the end of the second quarter given improving health metrics and the wide bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 vaccine availability we know that were better together and believe this will act as yet another positive catalyst to our efforts to grow relationships and add new ones in the second half of this year with that were pleased to take your questions operator question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask about the loan pipeline can you just give a little bit more color on the tailwind that youre expecting just based on the discussions youre having with clients and then also just the extent of this excess liquidity on their balance sheets and how its impacting their ability to appetite to borrow stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp sure ill talk about the loan pipeline and then turn it over to steven to talk about the excess liquidity yeah i think we are seeing opportunities pipelines are growing really across the lending segment but the level of liquidity that exists in our clients balance sheets is still very high but if you look at our lack of loan growth if you will this quarter you really see two segments that traditionally lead for us both energy and commercial real estate were down larger than normal and i think you heard me talk about in the fourth quarter call that we really thought energy would probably kind of bottom out or reach an inflection point we were hopeful in the first quarter but we thought it was more likely in the second quarter i feel more confident today that well hit that inflection point in the second quarter for energy as we began to work through the payoffs energy prices were very good in the first quarter most of those bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 borrowers used that extra cash flow to pay down debt we had some anomalies in commercial real estate where we had a higher level of paydowns in the first quarter that area is going to grow just fine so i think once those stabilize then we can begin to show growth again i think that thats really masking some good activity that we hope to see and were still hopeful in the second half of the year were very optimistic that youll begin to see some core loan growth that will come out of that portfolio which is why we highlighted the utilization in our commentary weve got a lot of organic growth that will happen just by higher line utilization in our ci book in particular and so once theres core economic activity that returns i think theres going to be some really good line utilization increases that will beyond new customer acquisition will help us grow our loans in the second half of the year so we feel good about that clearly its hard to predict youve got high liquidity on your customers balance sheets but theres a lot of stimulus and theres more stimulus proposed and we think that thats going to lead to higher economic activity that will organically increase loan activity but we feel good about it and we feel good about the quality of loans that were adding to were focused on segments that are sustainable and meet our credit fairway over a long period of time and so were not going to chase loan growth to meet market expectation but well stick to the core loan growth that has served us very well for a very long period of time ill turn over to steven to talk about the excess liquidity steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so peter i was looking at our average deposits just from a year ago and theyre up billion and billion that is in our commercial portfolios our commercial clients increase so clearly as you pointed out i mean theres significant liquidity on balance sheet and how that plays into when will that get used and if some of that will get used prior to the loan growth that stacy is pretty confident about it could be and we dont know the answer to that so yeah significant liquidity and certainly may play into usage of some of that before we get some of the line utilization we just dont know how much stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp but i think if you really go back to that liquidity part of that is ph the core quality of our franchise we continue to attract high quality customers in deposits even though youve seen our cost of interestbearing deposits continue to decline quarterly quarteroverquarter the movement that weve made there in the last months is really very strong in spite of the fact that were really not paying at a high level for those deposits will continue to attract those really speaks to the core franchise value of bok financial peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc can i ask a followup just on this line utilization you mentioned stacy that the core portfolios line utilization went from to today how much for every percentage point increase in line utilization does that impact commercial loans and where do you think it could go to by yearend stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 in general about million so plus or minus from there you can kind of do the math from there and see what you think we use precovid as kind of a standard we felt like that was a representative lot period for line utilization if you get higher economic activity than what we had precovid which is probably likely then youll get higher line utilization that will exceed what we were precovid peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp sure stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp thank you peter operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question will jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning this is will jones on for brady gailey how are you guys steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah good will jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good so just piggybacking off of loan growth for just one sec just thinking about loans as a whole i know energy has really kind of been a lot of the burden here lately do you feel like balances today are kind of at a low watermark on the total portfolio or do you feel like there could be more shrinkage to come stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp well i think if you look at what were calling the core loan portfolio so if you look on slide where we break out the paycheck protection program i think that those loans will run their course and so if you see that that can provide some headwind in the future as those get forgiven and will roll off but in the core portfolio clearly energy has been the headwind this quarter real estate was also a headwind which is which traditionally is an area weve grown pretty ratably over time the inflection point i believe is in the second quarter whether thats april may or june i dont know but i do think that well reach the inflection point where we do kind of bottom out in the second quarter at some point and then thats the level that we began to grow back from were seeing opportunities in energy yeah i think that even the rise in commodity prices in my view in the first quarter had a higher level resulted in a higher level of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 paydown activity than even what we were anticipating and forecasting because those borrowers werent using that cash flow for capex they were using that to continue to pay down revolver so i think that were within a quarter here of reaching that inflection point and then youll begin to see loans begin to grow back as weve pointed to now for two quarters second half of is really when were expecting the core loan growth to return will jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great no thats great color and its really good to hear the optimism on energy as that plays out and just lastly for me i just wanted to move over to just thinking on ma i know bokf has historically been pretty selective in its deal pricing and deal choosing but weve seen a great deal of activity already this year including cadence and bancorpsouth that was i mean really kind of around boks backyard just curious on your thoughts on a transaction of that magnitude if bok would ever be interested in that and just more broadly speaking how active do you think bok could be in ma this year steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah this is steve bradshaw ill take that one we certainly acknowledge whats kind of going on in the financial sector from a consolidation perspective in fact it seems even a little bit more acute in similar size banks to bokf including those two that you just mentioned and i think to me theres two major drivers for that one is the opportunity or desire to spread the expense base more broadly and we have an interest in that and in our most recent transactions thats been a key element for us as well the second driver really is investment in technology and you see that kind of mentioned time after time ill tell you that we dont feel the same level of competitive urgency because weve not taken any time off weve continued to invest in technology as an increasing percentage of our revenues really for the last five or six years plus and like our competitive position and feel like were on track and are able to compete upmarket with large investment firms as well as national banks so thats not as big a motivation for us so we kind of come back to our core belief on ma we really want to see banks largely within footprint that are high quality have great employees and management teams and have a broad business base we dont expect them to have the same base as us because were unique even among our peers but we want to see something more than a larger real estate portfolio frankly because were going to have to after we realize those energy or not energy expense synergies we have to grow it going forward and so our mindset is really we use revenue as the guidepost for our acquisitions can we can we add an acquisition that we think would be additive to revenue going forward your the other second part of your question was really size yes if the size that were at today it would have to be a more meaningful transaction for us than what weve done in the past the most recent acquisition we did was about billion in assets and it would need to be north of that in order to really move the needle in terms of ph expense phase and revenue growth and also be worth the kind of inherent distraction that you introduce inside your culture when youre assimilating one organization into another so long answer to a short question but i know whats on everybodys mind as weve seen so much activity and some deals announced just really even as recently as this week but thats how were thinking about it we would expect to have an opportunity to participate in acquisitions going forward but i think the bank that i described for you is probably not a seller in todays economic environment i think were going to have to see some economic bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 expansion and sustainability before the banks that are really in our sweet spot think its a good opportunity to merge will jones q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it yeah now it makes total sense thanks for taking my questions steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group please proceed with your question brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group hey guys good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group congratulations steve on your planned retirement steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you appreciate that brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group i wanted to ask i guess first about the reserve and just thinking about reserve release from here you had a reserve that got below prececl and im just curious how do you guys think about where the reserve might be able to get to in this new cecl world assuming the economy gets to kind of a roaring ph scenario where things are pretty good how do you how do you view the potential for the reserve to go down from here bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 marc c maun a chief credit officer executive vice president bok financial corp yes marc maun first of all just as a reminder when cecl was implemented theres a day one reserve adjustment that had to be made so before the impact of the pandemic and so forth on our reserve we had added reserve that took it more to so it came above the below level and then we added on additional reserve build related to the economic downturn and the pandemic and so once we evaluate the future of the reserve we will be taking into account the economic conditions well be taking into account our credit quality metrics both of which we think will continue to improve throughout this year and then the other factor will be loan growth and as that impacts it we want to make sure were managing it at the appropriate level to address that so the combination of that we hope that it will come down to that level but itll be a combination of supporting loan growth as well as looking at potential reserve releases associated with credit quality and economic outlook brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group okay fair enough and then on fee income the guidance i guess if you want to call it guidance for the categories to grow modestly with the exception of brokerage and trading and mortgage can you give us any thoughts around one mortgage from here do you think gainonsale margins are ph going to continue atrophying or do you think sort of encapsulated the pressure that you get from where we were previously with volumes and then just secondly on brokerage and trading obviously volatility here the past two quarters can you give us maybe some thoughts around how things play out there as volatility in that business slows as well stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp sure this is stacy and weve got scott grauer here as well who can chime in on the wealth side as well but i think as it relates to mortgage i think we feel good about going into the second quarter youve got some seasonality in the mortgage business where your second and third quarters tend to be pretty good quarters from an activity perspective thats going to help us a little bit you have seen some thinning of the gainonsale margins there but theyre still really good on a relative basis to kind of what normal is for that business and so thats still a really good place to be even though theyve fallen theyre still really strong there could be some pressure there but it doesnt feel like a return to precovid levels if you will in terms of where that is at least from what were seeing today so we i feel good about kind of the next couple of quarters as it relates to mortgage i feel really good about our growth in our wealth business the brokerage and trading revenue broadly but all thats happening there we really feel like what you saw in the first quarter is a number that we can do really well with and maybe hopefully outperform into the second quarter particularly that is a sustainable number and one we think we can actually grow from a little bit as steven alluded to in his prepared comments so we feel good about where were positioned in both of those businesses they are volatile if you look at the overall wealth business brokerage and trading both the nir and the brokerage and trading fee revenue component so total revenue for that business its up first quarteroverfirst quarter so youve got that tough comp with the fourth quarter where it was just a record and i dont want to lose sight of the fact that that bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 core business has grown substantially and we continue to commit capital to that so our capital commitment to the wealth business is up over from this time a year ago and well continue to support that because we really like that business brett d rabatin q analyst hovde group okay appreciate the color thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question q hi this is ph john brollier on for jared good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp good morning q i guess just sticking on the wealth side looking at assets under management and administration kind of flattish quarteroverquarter and you also mentioned the billion increase in equity balances can you give any color on i guess what the differential between inflows or outflows and changes in market value were driving that balance scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp sure so this is scott grauer and when you look at our total auma were actually really pleased with net inflows in the first quarter we have during the course of the first quarter very high planned distributions of assets a lot of it in our corporate trust group so we had total disbursements in the first quarter of over billion and so we saw net sales new sales of over billion so there is really kind of a moderate market increase of those total auma q okay great thats helpful scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 for the first quarter indiscernible high for that distributions from that so thats the big factor there q okay great thats helpful and then i guess just talking about building equities in that business is that kind of a longer term focus or i guess would you like to have it be more weighted towards equities to maybe protect the margin a little bit more i guess just higher level what are your plans on that scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah and so actually were we like our allocation and our distribution amongst the asset classes we have continued to see as have the broader markets with fixed income at these nominal yields and real yields equities obviously have just a better momentum in terms of asset flows when you look at in the first quarter we were just to give you an allocation we were cash fixed income equities and about in alternatives and thats a consistent mix and were getting a mix reflected off the assets that is on track with our target allocations so we feel good about that distribution to weather and grow regardless of rate and equity market performance so we feel good about it were always going to see efforts to try to grow our equity inflows because thats where flows in general are netting our positive in the overall market q okay great thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from line of matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc great thank you i want to circle back on the loan growth discussion and youve covered the energy topic pretty well i want to ask about commercial real estate its not particularly large at the bank but we did see a pretty decent sized decline in the first quarter any color on what drove that decline and whats the outlook on commercial real estate stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp no we feel good about the portfolio i mean you want a at least for us you want a commercial real estate portfolio that has some level of churn in it that indicates that deals are performing well and can be refinanced long term in the permanent financing market whether thats lifeco or cmbs or whatever we saw in because of the pandemic the lowest level of payoffs as a result of movement to the permanent financing market that weve seen in the last years for sure and so what you saw in the first quarter was really more a return to normalcy of kind of normal paydowns there where things are moving we had maybe a little higher level of it because we had some pentup opportunity there commercial real estate both the growth and the paydowns tend to be lumpy and best to look at over a 12month horizon as opposed to kind of linkedquarter annualized well be fine there well have good growth in commercial real estate we think this year were just going to have some lumpiness from quartertoquarter as bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 those advances and then the revised into the permanent financing market nonrecourse longterm lifecotype stuff will move out of the portfolio and that from our view is the sign of a healthy portfolio and thats our view about that matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks stacy and then on the healthcare side i think overall balances were relatively stable in the first quarter with kind of a mix shift growth in senior housing paydowns and hospital any more details you can provide and is that any kind of inflection that we saw in the first quarter stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp yeah i think that is the inflection we have some hospital systems advanced up in preparation for covid and the expense associated with that i think weve seen kind of the tail of that in the first quarter where those are paid back down and then you saw that senior housing core growth begin to come back were really seeing really good metrics coming out of our portfolios inside of senior housing we can monitor it on a weekly basis were watching occupancy come back up almost about a month in our core senior housing portfolio so once that portfolio really begins to stabilize we do think theres some pentup acquisition activity that can happen there that will spur loan growth on the healthcare side weve got a great team were well positioned for that and i think that that will continue to be a growth driver for bok financial matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson please proceed with your question gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning everybody steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp good morning gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co i wanted to ask about how youre thinking about overall balance sheet management over the course of this year you are pretty fully invested it seems like in the securities portfolio you do have some kind of excess balances but not nearly to the maybe extreme that some other banks do of several billion in cash and im just wondering how youre thinking about the potential for some shift in deposit flows over the course of this year as your bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 customers use their liquidity and put that to work and given particularly the low rates that you were talking about in terms of reinvestment steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah so this is steven i mean if you look over the course of the year we actually increased our availablefor sale securities portfolio billion so thats like so we did kind of put to work if you will over the course of the year some of the liquidity that was flowing in our direction we in fact added million this particular quarter first quarter well reinvest cash flows i think going forward but given the steep a little bit steeper yield curve i doubt if youll see us leverage up if you will that securities portfolio much more i kind of like where the balance sheet is we dont venture out we havent historically ventured out to assetsensitive in previous periods i think if you look at a parallel shock of basis points were about assetsensitive going forward and thats a pretty good level for us were comfortable with that so thats really i think what were thinking about in terms of the securities portfolio which is our primary lever for managing interest rate risk here at the bank and leaving that relatively stable by reinvesting cash flows which actually are a little bit better than they were in the previous quarter i think our cash flow has slowed down a bit and the reinvestment rates are a little bit stronger than they were last quarter so thats helpful as well stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp the other thing this is stacy i might speak to is is particularly as you people think about and talk to start to project more asset sensitivity when you look at various disclosures around that there are just a host of assumptions that go into that sensitivity analysis and its very hard to get applestoapples comparisons across the regional bank spectrum in terms of exactly how folks are looking at that but i would encourage the analyst community to go look at actual results the last time rates went up i mean if you think about weve had a recent cycle precovid when rates were rising and you could really see the performance of folks balance sheet as a result of that i think thats a better indicator in many respects than what folks are going to project through their q and k around asset sensitivity as we think about this going forward gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks for that steven going back to my initial question i apologize if i didnt ask it clearly i guess i what i was really asking you is given that you dont have as much excess liquidity on the balance sheet do you are you do you not have any major concerns about outflow of customer deposits as some of the stimulus burns off whereas other banks are holding a lot more excess liquidity so steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp no no no gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co just i was really asking how you think about that bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i dont think we do i mean i kind of described earlier that the increase in those balances i mean scotts world in wealth has increased a couple of billion there could be some outflows of that in the future if they find other places to invest but i dont think were too concerned about all that flowing away anytime soon gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thats great and then kind of finally up on stacys comments steven if you could maybe give us just a quick overview of kind of where bokf is positioned in the loan portfolio from variable versus fixed rate loans and kind of the impact of floors potentially as we can do get towards steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah i can do that gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co higher rates steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp so about of our loans are either variable or theyre going to repriced within a year so and that gives you an idea there we have of the billion loan portfolio about billion maybe just billion hedge floors embedded in it were getting a benefit of about million to million annualized on those floors and theyre supporting nim about basis points gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay and then just last one if i could squeeze one more question in here in terms of ppp with the addition of the second round here can you just tell us what the total remaining fees are yet to be recognized through that line steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yes i can do that so the original fundings of billion on ppp we had fees associated with that of about million and the first quarter fundings this last round theres fees of about million associated with that so a total of about million and we recognized million in we kind of expect to recognize around million in and then well see how the rest flows out but likely most of it in for the remainder of that balance gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay and of the million you expect in how much was recognized in the first quarter bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp about million just the fees gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co correct steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp now youve got the interest and of course the cost of funds against that against the so the total ppp in ph irr benefit in the first quarter was about million which is down a little bit from the fourth quarter thats one of the reasons that our nim declined a little bit more than what we expected just because of that ppp activity but thats probably just a push in the future quarters gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co great thanks for taking my questions steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning steven glen bradshaw a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hi stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc curious how are you thinking about energy loan competition over the next few years weve seen some of your competitors kind of back away from the space and say they maybe have a little bit less appetite there at least over the near term how do you think it play out bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2021 stacy c kymes a executive vice president chief operating officer bok financial corp well we think it plays out to our benefit i mean i think if you think about were about i guess of our portfolio is energy loans today weve been as high as we have lots of capital that were willing to commit to the space i think that as we look forward i think that creates opportunity for us weve often talked about what we like about energy is a full share of customers wallet so we do derivatives trading we have the private bank business with the executive team we have their 401k we have their deposit business and we have really good riskadjusted spreads in that business as well and so we like as we look forward over the next two three four five years we really like the profile of this business and the opportunity to grow it because as youve mentioned you are having some smaller competitors who are walking away from it now what will be interesting to see is its easy to walk away from that business when commodity prices are a struggle and executives have to talk about asset quality on an earnings call as you build some good results in this business going forward you may have some folks who step back into the business particularly in our footprint but we are really excited about where were positioned here i mean if you think about our place in the league tables relative to production in this business we are competitive with the very large national banks here and so as this area begins to return seeing some information just over the last week that talked about storage levels globally are at precovid levels today but demand levels are not at precovid levels so if you just kind of see that through i think there could be some more tailwind for some prices in the short term which would be positive but i think we really like the business we like where were positioned in the business i dont think theres a better energy team in the country than at bok financial so were excited to grow the business jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much stacy operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our questionandanswer session ill turn the floor back to mr nell for any final comments steven e nell executive vice president chief
