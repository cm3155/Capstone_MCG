will now turn the call over to bryan mckeag htlfs chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today by referencing our earnings release which details another solid quarter for htlf with earnings per share reported at loan growth of million excluding ppp significantly improved credit metrics and continued deposit growth of million there were several significant items that impacted the quarter including a million decline in income on ppp loans as ppp forgiveness slowed in q4 a spike in mortgage prepayment speeds in the fourth quarter caused premium amortizations on our mbs portfolio to accelerate reducing income by approximately million this quarter restructuring charges of million were recorded relating to the commencement of the charter consolidation project and writedowns totaling were booked related to branch facilities identified to be consolidated or downsized in some of these items lowered eps by per share before we go into more detail i would remind everybody that you can find additional information on the quarter in the fourth quarter investor presentation which is available in the ir section of heartlands website ill start my comments with the provision for loan losses which was a million benefit this quarter as underlying credit trends continue to improve highlighted by loan upgrades exceeding downgrades again this quarter non performing loans falling million loan delinquencies declining again to a new record low to basis points of total loans and net chargeoffs of only the economic outlook factors used to develop the allowance were largely unchanged from last quarter and still retain a measured level of caution and uncertainty that management deems appropriate for lingering economic headwinds that are yet to be resolved so at quarterend the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments stood at million or of total loans when the ppp heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 loan balances are excluded the total allowance stands at compared to at september in addition at quarterend unamortized purchased loan valuations on the balance sheet stood at million or basis points of total loans excluding ppp moving on to other balance sheet items investments grew million this quarter and comprised of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just over five years and generate about million of average monthly cash flow borrowings decreased million to end the quarter at million or just of assets tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to at quarterend and reflects a basis points decline due to the decrease in market value of investments another basis point decline due to the significant balance sheet growth this quarter these are partially offset by a basis point increase from retained earnings heartlands regulatory capital ratios also remain strong with common equity tier at just over and total risk based at just under so the balance sheet continues to be very strong and well positioned moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million lower than the prior quarter three main drivers of the reduction were a million decline in ppp interest and fees recognized this quarter to million from million in the last quarter we exited the quarter with million of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books second accretion of purchased loan valuation discounts declined this quarter to million as previously noted we have million of unamortized purchase accounting discounts remaining on our books at yearend and third due to the spike in mortgage prepayment speeds in the fourth quarter premium amortizations on our mbs portfolio were accelerated by approximately million this quarter just as an aside with the rise in interest rates since yearend prepayment speeds have already come back down to levels that should result in premium amortizations normalizing back to prefourth quarter levels in total these three drivers resulted in a million decrease in net interest income excluding these components net interest income would have been higher than last quarter the net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis this quarter was thats down basis points compared to last quarter largely due to the three items i just mentioned investment yields declined basis points loan yields fell basis points while net interest cost remained unchanged this quarter the net interest margin improved basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was down basis points from the prior quarter shifting to noninterest expense noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter up million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses core expenses increased million to million compared to million last quarter the increase is primarily attributed to a million increase in salary and benefits costs that were related to completing the buildout of our food and agribusiness division continuing wage inflation pressure and higher temporary worker costs related to several inflight it projects that we have been pushing to get completed before we began consolidating charters in mid2022 looking ahead to we believe htlf will continue to deliver strong results highlighted by loan pipelines that remain strong leading to expected loan growth except ppp in the to range per quarter as the economy normalizes and our new agribusiness finance group ramps up nontime deposit growth is likely to slow into the range per quarter assuming no fed rate changes net interest income excluding ppp fees is projected to grow midsingle digits on a percentage basis yearoveryear as earning assets grow and mix improves we estimate that two fed basis point rate hikes in the first half of would increase net interest income approximately million in due to our assetsensitive balance sheet and assuming much lower than normal deposit betas the fullyear impact of these raises would be an additional million over the increase provision for credit losses are expected to remain low for the next quarter or two and then begin to heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 normalize with continued loan growth and low net chargeoff levels as the economy stabilizes and covid and supply chain issues subside noninterest income excluding investment gains or losses in total is expected to be flat next quarter at about million to million we expect yearoveryear lift in core noninterest income in the range next year however higher interest rates would likely drive mortgage and trust revenues lower this also assumes no change to consumer nsf or od fees which were currently being monitored and assessed core expenses are expected to return back towards q3 levels or in the million range next quarter we are working to manage core expenses to minimal increases yearoveryear in by rationalizing branches slowing it and other spending and we should begin to realize some costs as we concentrate on charter consolidation some cost saves as we concentrate on charter consolidation however persistent inflationary pressures particularly wage inflation could be a difficult headwind the remaining charter consolidation restructuring costs are estimated at million to million and will be incurred over the next two years the consolidation will reduce run rate costs create operating leverage for future growth and presents some treasury revenue opportunities these benefits will layer in over the next two years and we are confident that in total they will reach million on an annualized basis when the consolidations are completed in late and finally we believe a core tax rate in the to range excluding any new tax credits is a reasonable fullyear rate with that ill turn the call back over to bruce bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc towanda i think were now ready for questions from the analysts heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a qa questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co on the spread income i suppose that i note that headwinds that youd discussed i was thinking maybe you might have a better quarter given the loan growth was that potentially was the growth was that pretty steady throughout the quarter was that pretty backend loaded in terms of tiein bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah it was in the back half of the quarter i think if you look at the average loans for the quarter and some of our tables compared to where we ended the quarter on a periodend basis we were higher quite a bit higher at the end of the quarter so yeah it was back loaded jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it and then you just had oneoff on the charter consolidation colorado the selection of that or kind of hows the charter is that kind of central to the geography business friendly state any kind of ideas of why that was selected bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah jeff ill take that one this is bruce several factors went into it one of them was that colorado does have experience with multistate banking operations so that that was one of the benefits they also have experience handling charters of our size not only today but in a future state it is centrally located for all of our brands clearly it emphasizes our growing presence in the west and the southwest and colorado has very favorable gdp growth so there were a lot of factors that went into it heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it and a last one on the costs associated with the benefits of the consolidation i guess its a twoyear process that million to million in costs is there a point where maybe the end of you start to its kind of a wash in terms of the saves versus the upfront expenses or just kind of looking for the timing of both expenses is that frontend loaded in that savings sort of in the second half if you could comment on just the timing of that bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think there may be a little bit of frontend loading on the cost obviously to get the project going in the first couple but i think we will get some cost saves also as we work through this and we make some decisions of what the organization will look like down the road so i think its probably relatively even actually the two amounts are pretty close as well so weve kind of viewed this if we can get this done and we can have a run rate thats got a oneyear payback to what it cost us to get this done we think thats a pretty good consistent save going forward for the cost jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc but we do expect to be able to get some of the expenses out during we wont be able to get all of them out but we will be able to start to its not like were going to have all of the expenses incurred in the charter consolidation and then we dont get any expense relief until the very end thats not the way itll be jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it so it sounds like get over the hump at the initial part and then additional expenses seem to be offset by saves and it would be pretty minimal impact going forward and then you begin to outstrip on savings bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah and then assuming we can continue to grow well get to a point where we believe well be more efficient given that one charter and not have to do redundancy so we can leverage future growth when we get towards the end of this a lot better jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 yeah so as we did when we did some of our customer compass work we believe that will add capacity through this as well as bryan was mentioning since we grow we wont have to add additional ftes to support that growth jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it okay sorry one last one just the i got the sense did you call forward some of the tax spend and other projects that you have going that may have led to i mean and maybe just an update on where those costs are if you look at the checks items on that slide youve got quite a bit complete so im trying to get a sense for where you sit on the expenses that might be embedded in your guidance but just kind of wanted to update specifically on where you are with the projects bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think were making good progress we still have some that have not what we call landed yet to get on the deck before we start consolidating but those are based on a meeting even as late as this morning are progressing as planned and i think youll see these costs that we have both the consulting costs and the temp people weve got in helping us get these done faster those costs will come down a little bit and some of them will then shift and their focus will be on to the charter consolidation which will start flowing through the recurring line and then when thats done they should go away so thats kind of the thought of how expenses should kind of work through here jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe a question for you bryan i guess when you think about the outlook for and i appreciate your thoughts earlier do you think you can grow revenue faster than expenses it sounds like midsingledigit growth in net interest income flat fees but on the expense side you seemed a little bit cautious given wage inflation and just pressure overall bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 yeah i think exppp again because thats pretty much done now i think when you take that out and you look at the core revenue growth it can grow faster than expenses again my biggest worry as you heard me say it is unless we get this inflation that just will not go away but i think even with that we can get positive leverage terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then just looking at the average balance sheet ci yields exppp really came down the to and kind of quite a bit of pressure on loan yields overall specific to the ci is that the ag kind of foodag business that kind of was added to the balance sheet or is that just kind of market pressure bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc terry i think its a fair amount of market pressure but also i think that we are bringing on a better quality of customer so the pricing is having is lower and were seeing it reflected in our alll funding so i think its quality of customer its market conditions and bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think its also terry where some of the lower amortization for our purchase accounting discounts are coming through there as well i was just trying to bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc indiscernible bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc pretty sure that thats a part of it as well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then just last question here basis point increase in rates if i take million plus million does that equal million in annualized net interest income is my math correct there bryan bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc that would be the annualized amount and thats what youll see in assuming no other changes it will just yes youre correct terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect okay i appreciate that thanks everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch with piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thanks for taking the questions youve actually covered most of what i wanted to go over but some on the loan pipeline and the loan growth im just curious what are your customers telling you and whats driving some of this growth is it market share gains is there any new borrowing yet from clients and then are there any locations that are doing better than others bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say a lot of our growth this quarter as well as whats in the pipeline is coming from our western and southwestern markets theyre growing a little bit faster than here in the midwest also the agribusiness group has a fairly significant pipeline but its gaining market share but also our customers are starting to spend were seeing a fair amount of capital expenditures now going on some of that is because they see their increased demand they feel it will be consistent its not just a spike up and then back down so theyre a lot more confident in capital expenditure spending we really havent seen much in the way of line of credit utilization increases it was like up i mean just a little bit so its not really on the utilization side we havent seen that yet andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it and then so it would be safe to say like the loans out west with the pricing is more competitive than what youre getting elsewhere just after were looking through look through and see how far some of these loan yields fell in the quarter bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc well we touched a little bit on that and bryan jump in here but as we are going upmarket a little bit into really more of a middle market space whether its in the west or the midwest the pricing is much more competitive we are getting a little better pricing out west but not like it is on the say loans million and below bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think what im looking at at least for the last month so i looked at december i always look at that right before the meeting here and its interesting the midwest the pricing seems tighter the west has a wider range and i think that these larger maybe better credit qualities are tending to get pricing at or even slightly below what we see in the midwest but then there are some the normal stuff that weve always done through years it seems to have a little bit higher price so theres a wider dispersion that were seeing in pricing than we maybe had historically andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it so some of these ph new ones are coming out for pricing are you able to get more like treasury management and card services along with that to help with the profitability heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah and i think they also and bruce can jump in here i think capital market fees are going to also drive a little bit more for us bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so thats been part andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc of our overall strategy to go a little bit upmarket better quality and then it will increase our ability to crosssell into the products that we have whether its treasury management whether its card whether its interest rate swaps so i think over time youll see us improve our fee income from those customers andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it okay thanks for taking the questions ill step back operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi david bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc hey bryan thank you for the update on the basis point impact within that guide for your noninterest income what type of deposit beta are you assuming and is that deposit betas for your home deposit base or just your interestbearing deposits heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc so it is just for the interestbearing deposits typically our nonmaturity deposits will take cds which is pretty small for us anyway i think our normal is probably to beta as rates go up so of the fed move is what our rates go up because of our strong base and because were starting at such a low point we assumed relatively no betas for first basis points and then we can assume or beta on those deposits the reason being we do have some small portion of index and so as rates go up we will those will have to go up but much less than what we normally would model in that to range david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay great thank you and then with the talking about the expense side and i think you mentioned you expected to come back down closer to the third quarter level for the next few quarters and that is exclusive of the charter consolidation expenses correct bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah that would be correct david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay okay great all right thats it for me thank you appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of damon delmonte with kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybody is doing well today bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc we are damon thanks damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great just to kind of continue on the expense topic here you mentioned that probably another branches or of the footprint looking to consolidate in is there any timing around that and any potential financial impact we could kind of factor in bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think the timing for that is probably going to be late in the second quarter into the third quarter just with regulatory filings and everything else weve got going on we did though some of those branches i mentioned one of the things we did is we did move them for to held for sale so what that does is it starts to slow down some of the depreciation on those buildings we pulled the mark of the value then at whatever we mark them or heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 the book value if we didnt have to mark them so we can get them sold so theres a little bit of the expense that came out relative to what where run rate was coming in but the biggest thing will be late second quarter early third quarter timeframe damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then is there a way is there a projected cost savings associated with that or those savings be reallocated to other areas of the operation bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc no i think we will well try to hold on to those cost saves i dont have the exact number here but typically we saved probably to per branch depends on the size depends on a lot of things but thats probably an average so youll start to see some of that come in like i said later on in the second quarter and hopefully damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc theres more bigger piece in the third quarter damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so thats kind of whats helping you keep that like million or million level then pretty much bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry million to million level bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc well thats the fee income thats on the expense side damon so thatll help us damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc im sorry i was at the wrong side yeah heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc so we need some of that because obviously the first quarter is million weve got to get the remaining quarters to come down to be able to get our yearoveryear to be that minimal increase that i talked about so theres some work to be done on the expense side to get there damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay great and then with respect to the reserve level now i think you said it was million exppp at the end of the quarter with all this growth thats coming on how do we think about the provision level going forward bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah and nathan can jump in here too i think we are at million assuming that the economy holds together and we get kind of past covid and we get to maybe a little bit more stable place we think that our probably normalized run rate is probably in the closer to million maybe million to million somewhere near between million and million of loans exppp so we have i think probably call it basis points basis points to come down and that would be coming out of what were holding in the economic component of the reserve so then once you get past midyear assuming that that happens and when the economy holds together then youll start seeing loans have to be provided for because they wont have the coverage at the end normalized thats probably million to million a quarter depending upon we believe chargeoffs stay low and if we can continue to grow million to million a quarter thats probably the range of what normalized would be damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats helpful thank you and then i guess just lastly with the agribusiness could you just talk a little bit more about some of the types of loans that theyre making and the size of them and just give a little bit more kind of color on this new business line bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so i would say the size is anywhere from million to say million we do have some growers but we also have processors and so its not just pure kind of ag i mean its truly agribusiness and its a combination of nuts berries leafy vegetables i mean its sort of what you would expect coming out of the central valley of california its a wide range heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2022 damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got okay thats helpful thats all that i had thank you very much operator thank you as there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to mr
