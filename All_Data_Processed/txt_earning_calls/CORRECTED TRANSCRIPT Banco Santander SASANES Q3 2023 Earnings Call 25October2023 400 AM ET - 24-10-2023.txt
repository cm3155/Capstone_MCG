delivered record profit of billion thats an increase of compared with q3 in thats in constant euros profit for the first nine months of was billion up in constant euros driven by strong customer revenue growth revenue increased by double digit yearonyear supported by all global businesses and all our regions commercial activity remained solid we added million new customers in the last months bringing the total to million we continued to advance towards a simpler more integrated model through our one transformation which is leading to efficiency improvements and growth in profitability as a result our efficiency ratio improved percentage points yearonyear to our return on tangible equity rose basis points yearonyear to nearly while our earnings per share improved by yearonyear supported by profit growth and share buybacks we further strengthened our balance sheet generating capital in the quarter even after deducting the share buyback underway and liquidity remains at comfortable levels and credit quality is quite strong all of this led to strong shareholder value creation and attractive remuneration tnav plus dps grew during the last months and we have increased the cash dividend per share by yearonyear moving to the income statement as always we present growth rates in both in current and constant euros profit increased strongly continuing the positive trends of previous quarters supported by first of all strong top line performance with growth in all our global businesses we have improved efficiency as cost increased well below banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 revenue reflecting our transformation efforts double digit growth in net operating income to more than billion normalization of loan loss provisions in line with our expectations and as i mentioned in the previous slide these trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record above that of q2 josé will go now into more detail on these points later these results maintained us on track to achieve our targets targets that we reiterate first of all good business dynamics led to double digit revenue growth our efficiency ratio improved and remains at the lower end of our target range even with investments in one transformation a strong balance sheet with cost of risk normalizing as expected and capital ahead of target with cet1 improving quarter on quarter our rote is close to and should comfortably reach our target at yearend looking closer at capital and value creation our cet1 ratio has grown yeartodate from to backed by strong organic capital generation after investing in profitable growth absorbing regulatory impacts and remunerating our shareholders according to our dividend policy we continued to grow our shareholder value creation which was up in the first nine months of the year and were increasing our shareholder remuneration with payout up to in september the board of directors approved an interim distribution against our first half results which is being executed as follows a cash dividend of per share to be paid in november higher than the equivalent in our share buyback program of up to billion that is currently underway since and after completing the current program santander will have bought back of its outstanding shares buybacks through share buybacks we are progressing in our new phase for value creation transforming the bank in the right way by changing our model to improve both cost and revenue one transformation which implies creating a common operating platform and technology for our retail and commercial business across all of our geographies will lead to improved customer service efficiency and profitability in simplification we have reduced the number of products by in thats almost less products in digitalization were making good progress with our digital self service model increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact centers by we have setup a fully digital endtoend onboarding process in mexico that takes just minutes to complete since its launch in july we have opened new accounts in the us we have already captured around million in savings from transformation and simplification as you can see on the slide the initial efficiencies from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed ph basis points in efficiency improvements our global and network businesses contribute to the groups profitability and have delivered ph basis points in efficiency gains for example multilatinas and multieuropeans initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and smes through our regional coverage model are growing at very high rates with revenue up by sic in yearonyear in private banking we continue boosting collaboration with cib and corporates which has generated over million revenue this year or in brazil we had acquired new relationships that brought brl billion in net new money in payments getnet already operates in five countries we expect implementation in chile in the next few months and in the uk in in auto we continued to strengthen our relationships with global oems since january we have expanded three of the our oem partnerships to new countries banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 finally our global technology capabilities have already resulted in a ph basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture ph million savings this year million from the recent deployment of gravity million from the new global agreements with vendors and million from the implementation of new it and ops shared services lets look at how one transformation is reflected in cost and operational efficiencies simplification is driving significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer process automation is enabling us to spend less time in operations in branches and turn this into a powerful sales and advisory channel since our investor day we have reduced the number of operational ftes per million customers by ph we are already deploying global tech platforms to improve customer experience leverage economies of scale and spread best practices we have implemented across the group proprietary backend gravity already deployed in three countries and cib this is delivering million in efficiencies in and we have executed billion transactions this year alone thats of the groups total were expanding our cards platform across the group delivering realtime digital processing capabilities to our banks and accelerating our business growth and will generate operational synergies of around ph million per year when its fully deployed finally we are being able to transfer the bestinclass products and processes from the country of origin to the rest of the group which leads to a strong value creation the contribution of our global and network businesses is clear in cib we continued to grow strongly our global presence has allowed us to grow revenue by yearonyear as we provide a onestop shop service to all our clients capturing crossborder flows and making cib products and services available to all wealth retail and commercial customers across the group and vice versa as a result revenue from these two concepts or network revenue grew by yearonyear to billion wealth management insurance grew revenue yearonyear well above target boosted by benefits of the santander network effect in private banking a fundamental part of our value proposition is that our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another today customers have billion of assets under management booked abroad thats higher than a year ago our payments business is growing strongly and faster than the market our payments hub has become one of the largest processors of account to account payments in europe spain the uk and cib are already processing a significant payment volume through pagonxt while we execute full migration of all the groups a2a payments in the next months in auto we continued to prioritize profitability over market share growth in a context of rising interest rates global auto revenue was affected by lower lease income in the us and the new regulation in germany one transformation is now being extended across the group and the increasing contribution from our global and network businesses are helping us to reach our profitability target across regions and businesses some geographies and businesses have benefited from rising rates and they should continue to do so in as for those countries and the businesses that do not benefit from higher rates they are already showing signs of improvement this diversification which is a clear competitive advantage will lead to consistent profitable growth and value creation the groups rote rose basis points yearonyear to around as mentioned before josé will go now in more detail to the groups performance thank you josé banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you hector and good morning everyone i will take you through the main lines of the pl in more detail starting with revenue there was strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter which made up more than of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter this was primarily supported by our retail business as we actively managed interest rate tailwinds in europe and mexico and due to the positive fee performance in latin america we delivered doubledigit growth across most businesses in particular our network businesses which made up of total group revenue the only exception was auto which was affected by lower leasing income in the us revenue at the corporate center also improved by more than million yearonyear due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from fx hedging most of our revenue growth came from nii which continued its upward trend increasing in the quarter driven mostly by europe and mexico we see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters nine month was higher yearonyear in constant euros on the back of positive sensitivity to rising rates mainly in europe and mexico and volume growth in dcb north america and south america in terms of profitability we have improved our net interest margin every quarter since the first quarter of gains from credit yields outweighted higher funding costs thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration leading to a clear margin expansion in europe we are strictly managing deposit costs especially in spain and portugal where there is excess liquidity in the system and lower credit demand the uk has a more competitive environment but betas remain in line with our expectations in south america deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates which results in negative sensitivity to raising rates therefore as interest rates are starting to decline we are seeing improved nii trends in north america in the us betas continued to increase although in line with our expectations while net interest margin in mexico expanded going forward in europe we expect further benefits from portfolio repricing in the context of stable interest rates or a slight increase which we expect will more than outweigh potential cost of deposit growth at least in the first half of next year at the same time as i said we expect to benefit from interest rate cuts in south america turning to fees in an environment of low fee income growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity our net fee income grew compared to the third quarter of and yearonyear with good performance across regions and businesses retail banking grew well supported by a larger customer base and are tailored and targeted value propositions our global network businesses represented of total group fees with corporate investment banking and pagonxt leading the way in terms of growth corporate investment banking is increasing its share of leading roles and pagonxt continued to expand its businesses increasing total payment volumes yearonyear and transactions wealth management insurance was slightly up as customers moved to lower value added funds than bringing lower fees however we saw increased activity in both private banking and santander asset management with banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 three consecutive quarters of positive net sales auto performance increased yearonyear driven by good performance in all our main markets in terms of cost savings from one transformation initiatives which will become more evident in the coming quarters are already offsetting our investments in tech and digitalization group cost declined real terms and driving down the transaction cost per active the transactional cost per active customer in real terms as hector mentioned earlier this in turn is reflected in efficiency gains led by europe which improved percentage points with cost flat in real terms in north america and dcb cost increased slightly in real terms reflecting investments to accelerate transformation additionally costs were also slightly affected by some perimeter effects such as the incorporation of aps in the us and mce bank acquisition a new stellantis agreement in dcb as a result group efficiency remains at the bottom end of our target range where we expect it to stay for the rest of the year credit quality remains robust across our footprint and in line or actually slightly better than our expectations which is supported by strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices in the us the npl ratio was stable and in line with expected levels and we remain comfortably on track to meet our cost of risk target of less than spain continues to perform well with a 12month cost of risk down basis points yearonyear supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions in other units such as the uk portugal and the digital consumer bank the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expect it to remain below or in line with through their cycle averages mexico is also increasing although it remains at comfortable levels mainly due to a change in mix towards unsecured loans in line with our strategy to improve profitability normalization continues in the us in line with expectations as we mentioned last quarter cost of risk in brazil seems to have reached a turning point the 12month cost of risk decreased for the second quarter in a row and the npl ratio improved basis points in the quarter reflecting the improving macro conditions and our focus on more secured and high rated customers to close with our balance sheet structure we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is welldiversified by segment product and country our balance sheet is low risk the portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has loantovalues average loantovalues loans decreased yearonyear as a consequence of higher interest rates reducing credit demand and driving early repayments especially evident in europe and especially evident within european mortgages positive dynamics continued in north america south america and dcb on the other hand deposits continue to grow well a yearonyear and in the quarter as deposit inflows more than offset mortgage prepayments growth in the year was concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates our deposit base is diversified and highly stable using lcr criteria of our deposits are transactional which are stickier and a high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes mutual funds rose with broadbased growth across all countries except the us following a year of instability in our fully loaded capital ratio improved to but by strong organic generation of basis points in a quarter which included basis point charge in shareholder remuneration related to the latest program of share buybacks that we are currently executing and basis points for the cash dividend accrual banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 we continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book return on risk weighted assets of up from in the first nine months of equivalent to a return on tangible equity above our current group return on tangible equity which will support profitability going forward additionally we continue to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of riskweighted assets with positive economic valueadded progressing well towards our investor day target of in increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years we are confident our fully loaded capital ratio will remain above even after taking into account the final implementation of basel iii in on a fully loaded basis thats all from my side hector over to you thank you héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé to wrap up these are the messages i will leave with you q3 was another strong quarter with customer and doubledigit revenue growth supported by all regions and businesses were accelerating one transformation towards a simpler and more integrated model which is extracting value from our global and network businesses driving efficiency gains and profitable growth we have strengthened our balance sheet and increased our cet1 while credit quality remains strong in line with our expectations all of these contributes to doubledigit growth in shareholder value creation and increase remuneration and will remain on track to meet our targets the execution of our strategy the progress we are making in our platforms and our local leadership makes us confident we can continue to grow and to increase profitability we see further upside potential for nii growth from the portfolio repricing and potential interest rates hikes in europe and positive outlook for the margins in south america efficiency already at the lower range of our target is expected to keep improving our revenue and cost as we increasingly realize one transformation benefits we expect the cost of risk to end the year better than target and we expect it to remain at similar levels in at our investor day we set our rote target of to we expect to reach our rote above by the yearend and continue to improve significantly during and we see our fully loaded cet1 clearly above target even after the implementation of basel iii in january as a result we expect to progress in our target of doubledigit shareholder value creation through the cycle further supported by our last step towards a full implementation of one santander which will enable us to fully capture our inmarket and global value and now thank you we would be happy to take your questions begoña morenés global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you hector were ready to start the qa session can we have the first question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions we already have the first question from francisco riquel from alantra equities please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you for taking my questions i want to focus on loan growth in spain has been particularly weak its down yearonyear the sector is minus i see that most of the fall is related to cib which is down over but smes and mortgages are also weak if you can comment ph the gap with the sector we know demand is weak but you are below the sector indiscernible more broader in other regions i mean loans in the uk are also down the sector is up brazil is up by the sector is growing so if you can elaborate whether you are prioritizing margins over volumes if you are more prudent on risk taking at this point in the cycle so loan growth in general ph and investment in particular thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you francisco yes basically as you have said loan growth has not been good in the all the year i would say spain mainly as you basically say is also being affected but prepayments in some of the mortgages if you see the portfolio of mortgages we have seen i mean normally basically we go down ph these basically we have had prepayments up to billion so far this year and youre right smes and mortgages basically have been not demanding credit as much i believe people are being cautious in the way and trying to see how the economy evolves even though employment has continued to be strong and demand continues to be strong this is a fact and we have seen the clients basically being cautious nevertheless if you see our portfolio in the rest of the countries mainly latin america has continued to grow there we have been maintaining and being very very cautious in credit appetite but also very focused on profitability so indiscernible the portfolio in latin america in a very good way but in a profitable way and also you have seen that dcb has increased and has a substantial good development during the year and we continue to see that over the next few months so all in all we are below in loans this year but we foresee that once clients basically see that rates are starting to stabilize and the market basically has a more clear view of whats going on i believe that credit will come back little by little i dont know josé if you would like to complement josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no just one final comment riskweighted assets are down billion in the quarter but is exclusively due to fx so if we look if we exclude fx impacts on riskweighted assets riskweighted assets are actually flat in the quarter which is what matter most for profitability and capital banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from antonio reale from bank of america please go ahead antonio reale q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning everyone its antonio from bank of america two questions from me please the first one is on the profitability outlook and the second one on asset quality in the us so starting with the first one youve reiterated your guidance for the full year which if im not mistaken implies a net profit of around billion for this year can you confirm thats right and how do you see profitability in it will be great if you could talk to us through how you see the main units performing into next year particularly europe brazil and the us my second question is with respect to asset quality in the us there was a big uptick this quarter and youve been talking about normalization cost of risk ph and weve seen lower used car prices and higher delinquencies but neither of them were material changes so my question is whats driving this can you talk a bit more about what youre seeing specifically on asset quality and related to that ph i see youve confirmed your basis points cost of risk for this year what do you expect this number to look like next year thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yes thank you antonio okay on profitability as i said during the presentation i reiterate the royalty so that basically gives you the numbers that youre looking for okay so in that sense were pretty comfortable on that on as i basically said we see also the portfolio repricing so we see on a strong first half of the year in europe and then we see a strong second half of the year in latin america when we see basically the dynamics changing and you have seen that and youve seen that in the numbers of this quarter when basically you have seen latin america basically performing better okay so in that sense that can give you a very good idea and josé will give you more details on that in terms of asset quality in the us and ive been saying all along that in the past few quarters its very important to understand that its always seasonal if you take a look of what happened last year in the third quarter it was actually the same and we expected that and we told you so and what is important to tell you that is actually better than we expected and also its not going to go beyond the basis points as you ph correctly point in that sense also we see that the portfolio is performing better in the sense that we see that people with 90day delinquencies or above indiscernible used to happen is we used to repossess about more than of those cars is basically performing much better and we are repossessing between and of those if the trade continues like that and used car prices in the us continue like that we expect better performance than we normally expect its important that you understand that we have a completely different mix today in the portfolio the portfolio that we had precovid didnt have as much prime and near prime as we do today our banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 prime and near prime is at around of the mix of the portfolio though that basically tells you that we expect the asset quality to maintain at good levels and also the us has been performing with a strong employment as well and the dynamics as well so in that sense im comfortable with the numbers were giving you josé please would you like to complement on the profitability josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah just one final comment on us asset quality the cost of risk in was and given the changes in the mix that hector mentioned we dont expect to reach those levels at all and we would expect cost of risk in to be fairly flat maybe slightly up to compared to in the us in terms of profitability well we still have negative sensitivity to rates in latin america so rates start going down we will see accelerated momentum in nii in brazil in particular coupled with higher loan growth and flat or slightly improving asset quality so clearly the profitability in south america sector mention is going to gain momentum throughout the year with a much better second half relative to the first half and in europe as he said we still have a lot to reprice on the asset side thats one example in spain we have around billion of mortgages you know that they reprice around ph every month well in fact we reprice of the total in the first half relative to the second half so in the first half of we will still reprice a big chunk of our mortgage portfolio in spain up yearonyear as they come to repricing so asset repricing particularly in spain and obviously some beta pressure some indiscernible deposit pressures with profitability still improving in the first half of the year so when you look at the total year we actually we remain constructive on profitability and profitability improving actually in relative to begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan just to followup on the previous question so could you just remind us what the current deposit beta in spain is and kind of how it moved in the quarter and also how you see the deposit beta moving in the other geographies in the uk us and i guess also portugal so that would be my first question and then the second question would be around the us tax rate it was very low this quarter how should we think about the us tax rate going forward and what the kind of normalized run rate and then if i may just if you could comment on any capital headwinds going forward thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sofie and indiscernible could you explain us a little bit the second question because we couldnt hear you well first of all on deposit betas i mean betas today in most geographies remain below the initial expectations that we had okay and in general terms theyre behaving rather rationally and we expect banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 pressure to mount in the coming months and the betas to increase i mean its normal because of the dynamics of whats going on okay and the geographies indiscernible different behavior our cfo will now give you a little bit further details on that josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah sofie in spain total beta is slightly over but if we exclude corporate investment banking corporate investment banking is already almost fully priced excorporate investment banking is remember that we have billion of current accounts in spain with very low volumes so and the beta there is almost zero we dont expect any significant change in the behavior in the market in the coming quarters so we would expect the beta in spain to gradually drift upwards but very gradually similar performance to what we have seen this year in the uk beta is if we look at the beta in the quarter its higher than that its around so here we would expect higher gradually higher betas but we are pricing assets also higher the new mortgage pricing in the uk today is around so this is going to help withstand the slightly higher betas that we expect next year for the rest of the countries portugal at poland and in the us is excorporate investment banking is very much in line with expectations not much to comment on that so bottom line is we would expect cost of deposits to gradually increase against repricing on the assets in some countries particularly in spain also in the uk et cetera héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sofie in terms of the tax rate in the us going forward what i could tell you and we could basically contact you to give you more detail i believe that we may improve it given that we are doing some leasing on electric vehicles and that basically will help offset in the tax rate that we have outstanding today okay but to give you details later we could call you and give exactly whats going on there josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa your final question capital headwinds the only one is the only significant capital headwind we have is the final implementation of basel iii still some detail rulings or regulations need to be written but bottom line is the total fully loaded impact would be around or basis points the phasing impact so the charge on january is going to be between to basis points so again very much in line with previous expectations maybe a touch better than when we expected begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you sofie can we have the next question please operator next question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas hi good morning just have a thanks for taking my questions and for the presentation i have just two questions the first one on brazil after the performance that we have seen this quarter where there has been banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 growth you were guiding before for a bit of an acceleration and you have been commenting into the quarter results that we should expect better momentum in the second half did you see a moment to change your risk appetite until we see an acceleration of growth also due to exchanges as we are seeing in mexico and what should we expect for from brazil and also if you could share a bit of color on what has been the driver of course growth in spain in the quarter and whether we should expect some synergies coming from one santander in coming quarters in spain or its more restricted to mexico and the us thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you in terms of whats going on in brazil ignacio a couple of points first of all what you have been seeing is as you remember we changed a little bit the mix okay so were changing a little bit that the cost of risk is helping us out first of all because our our some of them the positions that we took actually the credit loans that we gave are basically performing much better than we expected and the mix also is helping us out because remember that the mix that we changed went a little bit into payrolls and to secure loans and the mix us has also changed and is getting better were also seeing that the market is performing much better in terms of llps so in that sense were opening it a little bit i mean were open to a little bit more or of giving out loans in terms of going back a little bit to the credit card markets we are performing very well but our credit appetite is cautious nevertheless and we expect brazil basically to perform really well in that sense okay so youre going to see really growth in momentum also given that the rate is coming down and we expect the rates basically to continue coming down over the next few months so this is a double combination in terms of how were managing the portfolio and second because of the way the rates are moving in brazil so in that sense i believe its going to be much better in terms of the growth in cost in spain as you know we have been implementing one transformation okay so with implementation of one transformation were spending a little bit to transform a little bit some processes some things that were doing and the way were managing the bank in that sense but youre going to see a much better outcome in the next few months due to that fact because we are as you know we are simplification were doing simplification dropping the number of problems that we have we are doing also automation of many different things and we are pushing our branches basically to move more towards businesses that look at the incidence or problems so all that transformation that were making is the one that is pushing us a little bit to spend a little bit more but is going to be in control and we expect that to continue drop in the next few months so in that sense i feel confident that were going to be able to do that okay so in terms of in brazil going back to just to that just to tell you the second half is going to be much better than the first half of okay as ph we would continue to go on and we build up the portfolio is going to be performing much better okay i dont know josé if you would like to complement josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 no as i said i think the sensitivity to rates gains momentum so we have already started to see a slight change rates have dropped just basis points from to we expect another basis point drop in the fourth quarter but we would expect probably to basis points drop next year so this accumulate so when we look at yearonyear third quarter fourth quarter we will see rates probably basis points down so clearly the second half next year will look much much better in terms of nii than the second half of this year begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano your line is open please go ahead begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa next question and well recapture alvaro later on thank you operator thank you the next question comes from sanchez romero from citi please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning thank you very much my first question is on restructuring charges so i understand your profitability target is underlying and should we expect any material restructuring charges associated with your new reporting structure the second question is your outlook on operating expenses in the us youve gone on a hiring spree of investment bankers recently so what is the outlook for cost and how much revenue do you expect to generate as a result and just quickly on your effective tax rate in brazil for and what is your expectation regarding any potential changes on interest on capital thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you marta no we dont expect any restructuring charges at all or because of the restructuring that we just did in the organization the other way around actually we are moving towards lowering the cost as much as possible in the organization okay this is exactly what were doing its very important to understand exactly what one transformation means which means exactly simplifying first of all okay and simplifying the amount of problems that we have significantly okay second basically automation of a lot of the processes and this is mainly im talking about on the retail side which is quite important okay which means for example transformation in countries like portugal where we have already gone through a good really good transformation basically now of the things we do in a branch is basically operations and incidents and problems is taking care of the client in other countries such as mexico or spain is of that so basically this is what one transformation means and this is what were doing so simplification automation then were going to come in with the platforms you have seen a little bit what weve been doing with the different platforms that were deploying for example merchant acquiring that has been deployed already most in latin america youll see the costs coming down and you see also that we are getting banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 revenue on quarter from our customers so in that sense its very important that you understand where one transformation is and why are we doing this second in terms of your second question was on operating expenses josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa in the us héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa in the us okay very important question what were doing in the us is just a complement of the rest of our cib business okay what do i mean by a complement we have become a very large player in cib i mean large for the standards of latin america and a very important player also in cib in europe okay its important to point out that of the business that we do there basically is clientoriented okay its very important to understand that just is trading so ph is client flow is selling effects is selling plain vanilla derivatives is doing a lot of trade finance to our normal clients midsized and smes clients and this is basically the only piece that we needed is basically was to complement the us this is not in any means to really beef up our presence in cib in the us these basically will complement the rest of our business and also will give us capabilities in four or five particular sectors that complement the rest of the business that we do in latin america and europe in the us which by the way we were not making because we didnt have the capabilities so its not a huge thing visàvis the size of the group but its important that its going to be an important revenue generator and youre going to see that revenue is going to start to pick up in cib pretty fast given that because its already a complement as i was saying of the rest of the business josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa tax rate in brazil next year ph taxes on capital thats been proposed and discussed is not approved and we are not sure that the final shape of that tax will be the one that was proposed the finance minister believes that they need to do a more detailed analysis on the impact of that because the main reason for that is to tax companies that are not paying taxes the banks are paying already lots of taxes so i think we need to wait and see what the final shape and form of that tax will take but by no means its a done deal and definitely not in the way that it was presented thank you marta begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos cobo catena from société générale please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi good morning and thank you very much for the presentation indiscernible a quick question on revenue performance you explained how nii has been the key driver of revenue momentum however going back to the capital market day i remember that it was a way stronger emphasis on fee income and nonnii revenues which seems to be underperforming a little bit or initial expectations so could you elaborate on that is that market momentum has weakened but you see that being recovered in the future or simply that theres some you are running behind your initial plan and second when you talk about the cost of risk seasonality in the us could you explain a little bit better why is that i mean why there is such a concentration in provisions in the third quarter will be helpful to understand and lastly on reporting changes i dont know if you can share that already but when youre talking about ph the retail and commercial new global business line could you explain if you plan to have also regional pl and balance sheets for each subsidiary which will be consistent with the consolidated global unit or we are not going to have that detail thank you very much héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you carlos i mean i think its important to understand basically the dynamics in the market no if you see the fees for example in the first nine months we grew yearonyear okay is basically customer growth and the global network business is basically helping out no mainly cib and payments okay its important to say that global and network businesses now contribute to around of the total fee income okay and by that would increase from to so basically its according to our plan okay its important also that risk appetite increase is changing the portfolio mix okay and volume growth and ph transactionality increase is going to help out okay and we see also and youre going to see that its going to complement the revenue exactly what you were asking youre going to see a strong cib that is basically up yearonyear pagonxt is a payment site and merchant acquiring is up we have weaker wealth management that is around but its market conditions you know because its exactly whats happening in the market the auto business is generating more across the board okay you see very good performance in mexico and the us and europe is a little bit impacted by regulatory changes and retail youre going to see growth of around yearonyear because we had active customers coming in that are helping us out mainly million active customers that we didnt have okay so in that sense what im telling you is that we see that fees are going to starting to come up also helping out by whats the dynamics that we see in south america and mexico mainly okay so in that sense youre going to see that its going to perform well and also as credit picks up thats also going to help us in the fee revenue thats basically what has been one of the levers the fee revenue okay the seasonality in the us is has always been like that i mean thats basically the way people perform in this particular market i mean its a little different than it performs in europe and in that sense its always been marked in the third and the fourth quarter and normally becomes a lot better when people get more money during christmas and start to pay us back et cetera banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 the dynamic that i basically explained given that there is a very strong ph second hand car market in the us and also that people basically dont want to refinance their cars or dont see the availability of loans on cars for the next few months that basically ph should help us out and thats why youll see better numbers and i dont see the costs of risk going beyond the basis points and josé gave you a very good explanation of how whats the level of the cost of risk before and what is it today and we expected to continue okay and also the change of mix is helping us out okay so its very important for you to understand that but this is the way the market has been always and you can see it if you go all the years behind in terms of the reporting changes were going to continue to basically show the countries as a secondary segment okay so you will continue to have that information i dont know josé if i left anything out josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no no no i think we will report as we manage the banks so we will report these horizontal businesses as their primary segments obviously but we will continue as hector said providing all the information from a country level upwards so you will be able to see the countrys performance organized by these businesses and the global performance organized by country so you will be able to have both views at the same time thank you carlos begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi sorry for earlier a couple of questions one is really a followup and thanks very much for your steer on provisions for if i can sort of take advantage of given you opened that door in the context of what weve seen in the us within that flat provision what directionally or a bit of color on how could we expect the us evolve in and in particular i took note of your data on repossessions now it was i think you ph reported that number earlier in the year how quickly do you think the repossessions are going to go back to historical levels presumably this is savings covid savings and now you have student loans picking up is that something were going to see sort of going back to historical levels already in or do you think it could take more time just want to understand how youre thinking about the us within that ph flat group context and the second hopefully easier one is on the uk youve done pretty well considering some of your competitors in the uk has been a bit of a car crash can you maybe talk about the outlook there specifically for uk given what were seeing in the market pretty tough competition on deposits you had your own offer out in september so maybe you got a bit more visibility now for q4 and thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 yes thank you alvaro actually i was expecting your question on the us so let me give you exactly what is the important different dynamic that car has to student loans and different things the car in the us is quite interesting its not as in europe as in latin america actually people in europe and latin america pay first the mortgage and then the auto loan et cetera in the us its the other way around the us if you dont have a car you dont have a mean to go to work or to move around i mean youre completely isolated so the behavior of the auto loans in the us is completely different to anything youll see because of this particular issue without a car you cannot work and you cannot generate money okay so thats exactly why the performance of the portfolio has turn it in that way because people basically take a lot of care to do that and thats exactly why the behavior of delinquency is ph basically performing that well i mean normally if the economy complicates youre going to see that number of to maybe going up lets see how the us evolves and if we have a soft landing or not that will all depend on that also its important to acknowledge that we are changing the mix of the portfolio as we have said already no so thats quite important because we are much more concentrating with the funding that we have from our bank to be more in prime and in near prime and even though we will continue to do subprime because its a business that we know well and we manage pretty well in the terms of risk indiscernible but we are trying to change a little bit the mix of the portfolio and also we are offloading some of that risk through asset sales etcetera so its quite important to understand that we are really being very cautious about that and very cautious on the way were managing cost sorry cost of risk okay so i hope i answered your question correctly and then on the uk the uk as you have said we have performed well well end up having a really strong year okay we are working really hard to follow strategy in terms of cost we are also is very important advancing of one transformation we believe there is a huge opportunity there leading to indiscernible and the uk is leading probably to its best year in bottom line but is important that you see that there is an opportunity there in transform it and decrease the cost that we have in that country so i really do see the uk with a huge opportunity i was spending a lot of my time there because i believe there is opportunities nii has grown yearon year is driven by higher rates as you know and strong both we have a really strong focus on managing spreads and profitability okay so youll see that we have been lowering the portfolio of that because were very focused on that okay you see then q3 i mean we are as the rest of the market at both and we are offsetting the increased cost of the retail funding and slow down of new originations by basically playing that and also using a different mix of the portfolio and trying to see other opportunities okay its important to tell you that we are putting profitability ahead of market share okay and we have lower risk appetite as i told you and we believe that we could have a nim expansion by doing that begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 yes good morning first question on if you can remind us of the brazilian interest rate sensitivity second question is a followup on several questions from colleagues if you can actually give us a concrete indication of the structural tax rate in brazil and in the us in light of the new electric vehicles leasing that youre doing is this a structural move or is it just a oneoff that weve seen then on capital given that you are confirming your to target with a for this year should we not see also a natural acceleration in the organic capital buildup that you should be able to generate and finally digital euro what do you see as risks and opportunities from the digital euro implementation have you budgeted the impact to your business model and can you share it with us thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you andrea let me do the following thing let me answer your question on the digital euro and then josé will basically talk about the structural tax rates and the capital okay first of all its quite important to understand that the european commission has published a proposal of regulation last june okay which basically sets a framework and its a necessary condition for the digital euro to be launched okay they have publicly stated that discussions should not be rushed ahead of european elections in june and theyre saying that instead they will examine in a quiet and slow way by the new commission and the new parliament so we expect a long negotiation process to achieve a common agreement in that sense in parallel what we have seen is the ecb has just finalized investigation phase of the digital euro as they said the governing council published last week the results and they decided to initiate a twoyear preparation phase as we have heard basically focused on the actual implementation of it it will involve finalizing in the rule book and the selection selecting providers that could develop the infrastructure it is quite important and this phase will pave way to a potential future decision on issuing the digital euro or not but we see that its going to happen and as a decision on the digital euro ph i dont believe will not be taken before the regulatory proposal is approved so i indiscernible to its release before no on this context i mean also as banco santander we are aligned with the european authorities to design the european the digital euro also develop the paneuropean integrated payments market is basically very important we believe we generate value for consumers companies and the financial institutions and its also important to say that we will continue to monitor the potential impact digital euro may have on our banks in europe and also is important for us to have greater clarity as the ecb and the european commission finalize the regulatory proposal and implementation phase okay so thats the way we see it at this point with this i will basically pass it to josé to tell you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa hello andrea brazil interest rate sensitivity is million to a drop of basis points all things being equal tax rate the in terms of structural tax rate for the group going forward i think using is the right number this year is going to be a bit lower because of the tax benefits on ev in the us and then organic capital well the higher the profitability obviously the higher the organic capital generation we dont expect any significant regulatory charges other than the ones we mentioned and obviously always subject to available for sale indiscernible etcetera but we dont see any significant inorganic or extraordinary charges to our capital buildup so youre right i mean the higher the profitability the better banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 we also have a very strong focus on asset rotation we have started a team that is going to be looking at ways of optimizing risk weighted assets across the group in the first nine months of this year we have already rotated the equivalent to around ph billion to billion in risk weighted assets we think we can do more or less ph billion close to billion billion to billion this year and that will be the focus going forward the focus will be to rotate the balance sheet because we may not be the best ph tenors of some of the assets that we have in our balance sheet so on our balance sheet so the focus going forward is going to be the optimizing risk weighted asset consumption and maximizing profitability so youre right that we would expect the capital build up to accelerate in the coming quarters begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from pablo de la torre cuevas from rbc please go ahead pablo de la torre cuevas q analyst rbc europe ltd hi and thanks for taking my question i had a question on credit cards in brazil could you please provide us an update on the ongoing negotiations there between the banking sector and the central bank regarding the new limits on installment and revolving credit card lending in the country and if possible could you please give us any indication of the contribution to brazilian nii of this type to these types of lending and any estimates that you can give us on the potential pl impact of the new measures announced i guess besides the negative impact to nii are the measures also likely to impact fee income from lower transactionality and are there any offsets there like lower cost of risk or lower cost of funding that we should also think about thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you pablo josé will tell you basically ph about the situation in brazil again these are ongoing negotiations i just already referred to interest on capital here again the focus is more on corporates than financials obviously there might be an effect on banks but thats not the main focus but in our case it would have a relatively minor impact if it was approved as as it has been proposed but again we think that will change credit cards the 90day period for selfregulation is already counting and is finalizing by yearend we do not expect an agreement here so probably indiscernible the bankers association in brazil sorry the central bank in brazil will have to regulate there is a not minor possibility that we will go to a modeling which total interest paid by the customer is capped to total principal which is called the uk model again santander and febraban the bankers association are already working with the central bank of brazil to try to find a best solution its very early to comment on the impact because this type of regulation could have an impact on nii but there may be ways of offsetting these through commission income etcetera because there is a lot a significant rotation of the balances in brazil so again working on all of these very early to put numbers to these changes begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 operator next question from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank yes hi good morning carlos peixoto from caixabank couple of questions from my side as well indiscernible so on nii minor detail but or in a minor geography but in portugal you have a quarteron quarter increase in nii this quarter i see that the improvement in customer spread is actually lower than in the previous quarter and you do have an increase in the alco portfolio but in any case i was trying to see if you could have some color on the rationale on what caused this evolution and also what should we expect in coming quarters and then on the uk in nii as well im sorry if i missed it but i was wondering do you expect indiscernible highsingle digit increase in nii in the uk for this year you expect that to be the case still and how do you see it evolving into next year thank you very much héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay thank you carlos nii i mean as you said grew very strongly in portugal no its been helping us out basically because of the repricing of the portfolio the indiscernible and i believe that it will continue a good trend towards the end of the year if rates go up a little bit more in europe okay so that will help out and then well stabilize and thats my view because we see that the rates will stabilize at some time and we will see more growth in that sense so nii should stabilize in portugal okay in terms of the uk i explained you quite well exactly whats going on josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa if i may before you go just to give some more color on portugal when we look at yield on loans in the fourth quarter of last year yield on loans in portugal was in the first quarter in the second in the third so the yield on loans basically increasing almost at the same rate every quarter this year yield on deposits basis points basis points basis points basis points also more or less growing at the same pace so one quarter theres obviously seasonality balances number of days all of these may explain the differences but again when you look at the trends the trends in portugal are very consistent we would expect as héctor said obviously there is a limit to the repricing of assets and mortgages in portugal contrary to spain are linked to the 6month euribor not the 12month euribor in spain so the flattening out on the asset side in portugal is going to happen a bit faster than in spain but again the cost of deposits in portugal is really really low and we dont see any competition there so we remain constructive in the next few quarters in portugal héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé very quickly on the uk carlos i mean as i said basically i mean we continued to put profitability ahead of market share okay and we have lower risk appetite given the dynamics in that market and we combine that and wed like to combine that with indiscernible performance that basically could lead to a nim expansion but answering your question i expect with a highsingle digit growth and on high rates management of deposit cost while we assume the lower volumes that we have okay and thats basically the outlook that we have for the uk at this point i dont know josé if you would like to complement but i think with that i answered your question banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from britta schmidt from autonomous please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research llp yeah hi there thank you for taking my questions the first one will be on the nii in spain the customer spread widens and youve also increased the alco portfolio but the nim was flat so maybe you can explain whats happened there and also give us an update on the alco portfolio and the second one will be on chile weve seen a big decline in nii here i think the business has guided to a big decline in profits this year but what do you think is the outlook there for this year and also when will the nii improve in thanks héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you britta i will start basically give you the overview and then josé can give you a little bit more of details on both okay i mean spain as you say is one of the countries that has benefited the most from the higher rates okay and we continue to see as i said strong growth from clients okay we have new customers net new customers in the last months okay we see also a strong contribution from the global businesses okay wealth management is increasing yearonyear cib im talking about pat and cib is also achieving a substantial growth a net margin growth midteens maintaining superior profitability levels okay so youre going to see that we expect double digit nii growth in okay and in terms indiscernible to consider we see as josé explained you in detail assets repricing at least during the first half of okay clients continue to grow and indiscernible particular issue we see no minimum no meaningful deposit moments in spain in reaction to prevailing rate here our deposit base is extremely automized of our deposit base have an average balance of which basically contributes to the stability also is very important to take into account that the one transformation i explained is going through in spain as well and were very focused on product simplification as i said were reducing the product portfolio were doing a process of optimization there okay but i see that exactly thats the trend that is going to have exactly as josé basically detailed i dont know josé if you would like to complement but you already gave a lot of detail josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah britta let me tell you yield on loans this is the same explanation that we have for portugal quarteron quarter it basically has to do with many many probably many small things but when you look at yield on loans in spain from the fourth quarter of last year first quarter second quarter fourth quarter so very much almost an straight line increase and in the case of deposits also the same basis points basis points basis points basis points in the last couple of quarters basis points basis points increase so very much flat so the point here is that we still have a substantial part of our balance sheet in spain that will reprice up in the first half of next year i just used the figure for mortgages is billion and around reprices in the first half banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 so i think the yield on loans will continue although the rates interest rates in spain might stay or in europe may stay flat the repricing of assets in spain will continue for at least the first half of next year and in terms of the pressure on the cost of deposits again most of institutional deposits corporate investment banking deposits have already repriced so the question is to what extent the cash balances in the current accounts will move to time deposits to what extent customers have excess liquidity in their current accounts to be put aside for time deposits and we think that is a limited its a very limited amount so we see not a lot of pressure on that particular part of the business for increased cost of deposits in chile in chile we have two balance sheets so two sensitivities to the balance sheet one is to rates and the other one is to inflation obviously the relative movements of inflation and rates is what explains what weve seen so we have seen already inflation going down rates going down slower so as the inflation continues to go down and rates follow we will see the reversal so we see nii in brazil actually expanding again gaining momentum towards the second half of next year but expanding substantial in the second half of next year relative to the second half of this year because again the relative movement that we have between inflation which is the us and rates begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from hugo cruz from kbw please go ahead hugo cruz q analyst keefe bruyette woods hi thanks for the time hugo from kbw just couple questions mexico nii the growth indiscernible to be quite strong i guess im not going to ask you why itd been stronger than expected but i wonder if you could give guidance on for the full year what kind of nii growth you expect in euros and then finally on argentina quite volatile and we have elections soon so i was wondering if you can give what to expect an impact from the elections but also if you could give guidance on the earnings for this year and the next thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you okay mexico as you have seen has been had a strong growth in nii its a combination of many things first of all the rates increase but most of that is basically because of the change of the mix that we have performed in the country okay we saw an opportunity of basically switching a little bit of the portfolio into credit cards and our secured loans and payroll loans to individuals so to have a much better structured mix than we used to have before okay so mexico is helped out by the rates but also by the change of the mix of the portfolio all right so its quite important to see that we see that mexico will continue to have a really good trend i mean mexico as you have seen has grown pretty well pretty nicely over the past few months and i believe its going to grow strongly also in okay the important thing to understand exactly how rates are going to perform and thats going to depend a little bit on what happens in the us all right both i see that if rates continue to be stable and the economy performs well i believe that mexico should develop very good on and continue to have very good growth on nii okay banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 in terms of argentina as you have seen we have a i would say complicated environment to say the least about of whats going on we really and i wouldnt like to basically make a prediction of what could happen but looks that may things may stay as they are we have as you know a potential difference between the in the exchange rate between the official exchange rate and whats happening in the black market so in that sense lets see how it evolves and how the government would like basically to land the difficult task they have in front josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no the just one final comment here the way weve managed argentina is to were trying to hedge obviously against inflation and hedging our investment against inflation and that will continue to be the key element obviously there is a big difference between official exchange rates and unofficial exchange rates well aware of that we are aware of the impact that a devaluation could have on our books so we are managing that to minimize the impact if that was to happen and obviously again the key is to preserve the value of our investment in brazil but basically by managing and investing inflation risk begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you very much can we have the next question please operator next question from fernando gil de santivañes from bestinver please go ahead fernando gil de santivanes dornellas q analyst bestinver sociedad de valores sa thank you very much for taking my questions three quick ones please first one on digital consumer bank i see return on tangible book at still a bit soft from the target of that you have for the plan can you please comment the outlook for please this is the first one second would be about the alco portfolio i see an increase of about ph billion in the quarter can you please address the strategy and the level of unrealized losses you have in the portfolio and finally on poland if you can please comment on the outlook for the indiscernible please thank you very much josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so let me start with poland the proposal comes from the current government we need were not we are going to have a new government and this will have to go to parliament so very early stages of this proposal and i am almost sure that some other form of proposal if any will be conducted because again this is a proposal of the existing government not the upcoming government the alco sorry also britta asked about this and i forgot we have more or less ph billion almost billion of alco in spain at an average yield of around we expect to end the year at around ph billion we might increase the alco a little bit more next year obviously taking advantage of the higher yields so depending on how you measure the profitability of this if you measure these against average cost of deposits or against the marginal funding cost you have different profitability but obviously this is going to add significant push to the profitability of the group next year dcb i dont know you want to comment on dcb and the outlook for the business banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yes i mean on the dcb there has been a particular change in the business in the this year no in dcb in particular there is one very important we had really good growth in terms of loans but the majority of those loans the vast majority is basically stock financing okay given the dynamics that the auto market has had over the past few months first of all there was not enough production then the production started and now basically we are financing a huge amount of the car dealerships we expect basically to start that dealerships to start moving that inventory out and that basically will produce more the normal auto loans and then will give us the normal nii that we are accustomed to at this point okay so thats basically the way we believe that this is going to evolute it is important to acknowledge that also we have been able to finance a lot of this portfolio with our own deposits instead of going that much to wholesale and also youre going to see a dynamic or what josé was telling you about of selling a lot of these portfolios out into the market once we basically start out giving out loans direct to individuals okay so we believe that the outlook would be good its important to see also how the economy evolves mainly in europe and that would also depends on how fast the inventories moved josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah one final comment here although we have a neutral position into rates in dcb obviously the higher the rates the more difficult the business is particularly when rates start going up so once rate stabilize the business also stabilizes and increases the profitability the difficult the difficulty in managing dcb is when rates actually go up because of that we do not have sensitivity to that movement obviously the customers do not react well to do that so that one point i wanted to make the other point is on cost of risk we would expect the cost of risk in dcb to gradually trend towards the normalized level of around basis points a year taking into account that these will depend on asset sales securitizations etcetera so our aim is to try to minimize that like héctor was saying by managing the assets that we have on our books begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the last question please operator last question from ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch hi good morning ive got three followups first one is on nii in brazil i mean are you sticking to the guidance you gave in q2 that q4 will be better than q3 and if you can give a little of color in terms of pattern of nii expansion next year should we expecting like a linear increase through the year or youre going to have some degree of seasonality at some point second one is on the us im sorry if you have mentioned that already but what has driven the percentage point decline of the coverage in the quarter in the unit and the third one is on capital return given your comments around accelerated capital generation as profitability goes up and mindful of basel iv but do you see any chances of topping up your capital or increasing your shareholder return in thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2023 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you look ignacio in terms of nii in brazil i think its important i mean i will reiterate first of all as i have seen the worst of the nii is behind us we continue expecting an improvement both in nim and nii in the coming quarters okay rates as josé explained you have started to curve down i mean basis points in the q3 our numbers basically tell us that maybe they will come down towards the end of the year to ph so that basically tells you were flat in the q2 declining rates plus credit activity increasing plus marketrelated nii no longer a drag nii improvements so that basically tells you that yes we believe that the second sorry that the fourth quarter is going to be better than the third okay in terms of what do we see in the future is exactly as josé explained you is that we see a trend going upwards towards more towards the second half of the year next year okay and thats the way we see it is going to help out if rates continue to come down and volumes continue to go up well thats exactly the beauty of the diversification model that we have at this point all right in terms of the us coverage okay is basically i mean the normal seasonality indiscernible loan to values include recording value of the cars okay and in addition on the quarters we have indiscernible rating of several companies in the sector and in fintech charges due to originations in that sense but i see that this would normalize towards the beginning of next year as i said okay so in that sense i dont see a problem in that is also there was an increase in provisions mainly as i said i mean the ltv and the stage balance with a gst remediation but other than that i think indiscernible it was quite normal cost of risk as i said is okay and is below the basis points that we indicated as guidance for the year and total coverage ratio is indiscernible portfolio is flat yearon year indiscernible i dont know if that answers your questions and in terms of the capital return please josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no i think thats for the board to decide so for this year the policy has been decided and thats for the board to decide obviously begoña morenés global headinvestor relations banco
