good morning everyone as we reflect on the past quarter and the first half of the year were very pleased with our progress the second quarter results include the impact of the peoples united financial acquisition which closed on april were excited about the momentum we have as a combined organization especially the progress both franchises are making in preparation for the planned systems conversion later this quarter with strong nii growth and effective expense management mt generated positive operating leverage as pre tax preprovision net revenue increased by more than million versus last quarter we repurchased million of our common stock in the second quarter and yesterday the board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to billion in mt common stock our balance sheet management enabled us to benefit from the changing interest rate environment boosting the net interest margin and allowing us to deploy excess cash into investment securities with higher yields with more fed hikes projected this year we continue to add more fixed rate assets to our balance sheet and to continue expanding our interest rate hedging program while were just beginning to see the positive net interest income benefit from rising rates those same higher rates have prompted headwinds in our mortgage banking business both for origination volumes and for gainon sale margins we expect these headwinds to persist despite the macro challenges the unemployment rate remains low and credit quality remains strong were wellpositioned for the future and excited to continue the integration of the peoples united franchise and to deploying our excess cash and excess capital now lets review the results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the second quarter of compared with in the first quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter on a gaap basis mts second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share that compares to million or per common share in the prior quarter pretax mergerrelated expenses of million related to the peoples united acquisition were also included in these gaap results these mergerrelated expenses are comprised of the socalled cecl day two double count of million plus additional pretax mergerrelated expenses of million the total mergerrelated charges translate to million aftertax or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we only ever exclude the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions mts net operating income for the second quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the mergerrelated expenses was million compared with million in the linked quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2022s first quarter net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the first quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results including tangible assets and equity as a reminder included in the first quarters gaap and net operating results was a million distribution from our investment in bayview lending group this amounted to mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 million aftertax effect and per common share we did not receive any distributions in this years second quarter next lets take a little deeper dive into the underlying trends that generated these results taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in the second quarter of an increase of million or from the linked quarter the linkedquarter increase was due largely to the million net interest income contribution from peoples united this amount included million for purchase accounting accretion the legacy mt bank net interest income increased million sequentially inclusive of the million impact from higher rates on interestearning assets an million increase from one additional day in the quarter partially offset by a million decline in the benefit from cash flow swaps and a million decrease in interest received on nonaccrual loans and a million decline in interest income and fees related to ppp loans net interest margin for the past quarter was up basis points from in the linked quarter the primary driver of the increase to the margin was from higher interest rates which we estimate boosted the margin by basis points the peoples united earning asset yields added basis points to the net interest margin and in addition margin benefited from a reduced level of cash held on deposit with the federal reserve which we estimate added basis points these items were partially offset by a 6basis point decline resulting from the lower interest income recovered on nonaccrual loans all other factors including the day count had a negligible impact on the margin before we discuss the average loan balance trends for the quarter we note there were reclassifications within the peoples united commercial loan portfolios in order to be more consistent with mts reporting methodology just over billion in loans that peoples united had classified as ci were reclassified into cre loans compared with the first quarter of average loans outstanding increased by billion or due primarily to the billion average impact of the peoples united loans looking at loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans increased by billion or about the average impact from the acquired peoples united loans was billion legacy mt ci average loans increased by about billion with strong growth in middle market ci loans and average dealer floor plan balance growth of million this growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in ppp loans on an endofperiod basis for the combined bank ppp loans amounted to million average commercial real estate loans increased by billion or compared with the first quarter the average impact from the acquired peoples united loans was billion legacy mt cre average balances declined million during the second quarter due to almost equal reductions in construction and permanent loans we continue to reduce our construction exposure as there is a lack of new activity to offset the conversion of construction loans into permanent mortgages there was an uptick in permanent mortgage financing in the quarter however it was outpaced by an elevated level of paydowns residential real estate loans increased by billion or due almost entirely to the average impact of the peoples united loans the legacy mt average loan balances were essentially flat as the retention of new originations retained for investment were offset by normal runoff combined with the sale of ginnie mae buyouts that became eligible for repooling into new rmbs mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 average consumer loans were up billion or again due in large part to the billion average impact from the peoples united loans for legacy mt recreational finance loan growth continues to be a key driver of growth average investment securities increased by billion due to the billion average impact from the acquired peoples united securities and a billion increase in legacy mt investment securities average earning assets excluding money market placements which is inclusive of cash on deposit in the federal reserve increased billion or due largely to the billion average impact of peoples united and growth in legacy mt average investment securities after closing the acquisition we implemented various balance sheet restructuring actions to optimize the funding base of the combined bank these actions utilize some of the cash available and resulted in a decrease in deposits many of these actions occurred during the quarter so we thought it would be more informative to look at the change in endofperiod cash balances cash balances decreased by billion to billion at the end of june down from just over billion on april the decline was the result of several factors these include a billion increase in investment securities a billion restructuring of some peoples united highcost deposits notably broker deposits a billion decline in escrow and mortgage warehouserelated deposits reflecting lower levels of activity associated with the rising rate environment a million reduction in trust demand deposits resulting from lower levels of capital market activity compared with the first quarter and a billion drop in municipal deposits we continue to actively manage highercost deposits and in many cases retain the customer and are able to move their balances to an offbalance sheet alternative that provides the interest rate they desire with that background average core customer deposits which exclude cds over increased by billion or compared with the first quarter the average impact from the peoples united deposits was about billion turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter compared with million in the linked quarter the peoples united noninterest income contributed million while legacy mt declined by million as noted mt received a million distribution from bayview lending group in the first quarter and did not receive any distribution in the second quarter of this year mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter revenues from our residential mortgage business were million in the second quarter compared with million in the prior quarter residential loans originated for sale were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the first quarter both figures reflect our decision to retain a substantial majority of our mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet the primary driver of the linked quarter decline in revenue is the higher interest rate environment which has pressured gainonsale margins for loans previously purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools and which became eligible for resale or repooling with the rapid increase in yields for new mortgage originations over the past few months these ginnie mae repooled loans have fallen below new origination yields which has driven the negative gainonsale margin during the quarter residential mortgage loans were sold at a loss of million compared to a million gain on sale in the prior quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the second quarter essentially unchanged from the linked quarter that figure was million in the yearago quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 trust income was million in the recent quarter and included about million in income from peoples united legacy mt trust income increased about due largely to about million from the recapture of money market fee waivers and million in seasonal tax preparation fees partially offset by the impact of lower market valuations on assets under management and administration service fees on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the first quarter peoples united contributed million to this fee income line during the quarter the decline in legacy mt service charges primarily reflects the previously announced repricing of our consumer checking products we expect foregone revenues from the program to reach a run rate of million per quarter during the second half of the year operating expenses for the second quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger related expenses were billion and included about million in expenses from the operations of peoples united legacy mt operating expenses were about million compared to million in the linked quarter and million in the yearago quarter recall operating expenses for the first quarter include approximately million of seasonally higher compensation costs aside from those seasonal factors that flows through salaries and benefits legacy mt operating expenses increased by million from the first quarter this increase was due almost entirely to higher salaries and benefits costs resulting from one additional business day a full quarter impact of merit increases and increased incentive accruals tied to improved bank performance the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2022s first quarter and in the second quarter of last year next lets turn to credit despite the lingering challenges of the pandemic and its variance supply chain disruption labor shortages and persistent inflation credit is stable to improving the allowance for credit losses amounted to billion at the end of the second quarter up million from the end of the linked quarter the increase was due largely to the impact of the allowance related to the acquired peoples united loan portfolio we ran the acquired loan book through our allowance methodology and essentially confirmed their allowance at closing applying the provisions from the cecl accounting principle we assigned million of the peoples united allowance to purchase credit deteriorated or pcd loans and million to nonpcd loans in addition we recorded a million provision in the second quarter partially offsetting these increases were net chargeoffs of million in the second quarter compared to just million in this years first quarter economic indicators continue to show improvement from the prior period but inflation remains at historically high levels aside from movements in forward interest rate curves the second quarters baseline macroeconomic forecast was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter for those indicators that have a significant impact on our cecl modeling results including the unemployment rate gdp growth and residential and commercial real estate values nonaccrual loans increased to billion compared to billion sequentially the increase was entirely the result of the acquired peoples united loan portfolio as nonaccrual loans at legacy mt decreased sequentially at the end of the second quarter nonaccrual loans represented of loans down from at the end of the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 linked quarter when we file our second quarter 10q in a few weeks we expect to report an increase in criticized loans however the percentage of loans recognized as criticized will decrease similar to the trends in the non accrual portfolio the increase in the dollar amount of criticized loans is due entirely to the acquired peoples united portfolio we expect a modest decline in criticized legacy mt loans as noted chargeoffs for the recent quarter amounted to million annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the quarter compared to basis points in the first quarter loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the quarter down from million sequentially in total of these days past due loans were guaranteed by governmentrelated entities turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated compared with at the end of the first quarter the decrease was largely due to the impact of the peoples united acquisition and the repurchase of million in common shares which represented of our outstanding common stock tangible common equity totaled billion increased from the end of the prior quarter due largely to the impact of the peoples united merger tangible common equity per share amounted to per share down or from the end of the first quarter as previously noted the board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for up to billion of common stock which replaces the previous million repurchase program under which million of mt shares were purchased in the second quarter now lets turn to the outlook interest rate expectations continue to be volatile and can have a material impact on our outlook for full year similar to last quarter the outlook that follows reflects the combined balance sheet with three quarters of operations from peoples united as well as a more recent forward curve and is on a full year basis first lets talk about our outlook for the balance sheet we continue to expect to grow the investment securities portfolio by billion per quarter for the remainder of the year however that cadence could accelerate or slow depending on market conditions as well as customer loan demand now turning to the outlook for average loans when compared to standalone mt full year average loan balances of billion we continue to expect average loan growth for our combined franchise to be in the to range however growth may come in near the lower end of that range note that the updated average growth rates for ci and cre loans reflect the reclassification of ci loans into cre loans in the former peoples united loan book that we mentioned earlier on a combined and full year average basis we expect average ci growth in the to range we expect average cre growth in the to range average residential mortgage growth in the to range and average consumer loan growth in the to range as we look at the combined income statement compared to standalone mt operations from we believe were wellpositioned to benefit from higher rates and to manage through the macro challenges we noted earlier on this call our outlook for net interest income for the combined franchise is for full year growth compared with the billion in this reflects the forward yield curve from the beginning of the month given the speed of interest rate hikes by the fed the reactivity of deposit pricing and the deployment of excess liquidity and loan growth the full year net interest income could be plus or minus turning to the fee businesses we still expect strong trust income growth driven by new business and the recapture of money market fee waivers but albeit lower than previous expectations as a result of the lower equity valuations from second quarter in addition higher interest rates are expected to continue to pressure mortgage originations and gainonsale margins we have completed the sales of ginnie mae repooled mortgages and we mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 will continue with the retention of almost all originations for the rest of the year with this in mind we expect the gain on sale from residential mortgages to be minimal in the second half of the year we therefore now expect noninterest income to grow in the to range for the full year compared to billion in next our outlook for full year operating noninterest expense is impacted by the timing of the peoples united systems conversion and subsequent realization of expense synergies we continue to anticipate to growth in combined operating noninterest expenses when compared to the billion in however expenses are likely to be near the higher end of the range reflecting inflationary pressures on wages and improved bank performance as a reminder these operating noninterest expenses do not include pretax mergerrelated charges we do not expect these charges to be materially different than our initial estimates turning to credit we continue to expect credit losses to remain well below mts longterm average of basis points for we conservatively estimate that net chargeoffs for the combined company will be in the basis point range finally turning to capital we believe the current level of core capital is higher than what is needed to safely run the combined organization and to support lending in our communities we plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace late in june the federal reserve released the results of its stress test also known as the dfast based on the dfast results mts preliminary stress capital buffer or scb is estimated at as a result we will be subject to a common equity tier ratio threshold under the scb regulation which is in effect from october through september mts common equity tier ratio of at june comfortably exceeds the threshold although which capital distributions could be limited by that regulation we continue to anticipate ending with a cet1 ratio in the range with a solid starting capital position and the potential to generate significant additional amounts of capital over the next few years we dont anticipate a material change to our capital distribution plans our objective as always is to bring our cet1 ratio down gradually to a level that is near the high end of the lower quartile of our peer group we anticipate continuing to repurchase common shares under the new billion repurchase program so now lets open up the call to questions before which gretchen will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions thank you the first question well take is betsy graseck from morgan stanley q hi good morning this is ph brian on for betsy was wondering if you could give us an update on your rate sensitivity today now that were a little bit further into the rate hike cycle and assuming that the current forward curve plays out where do you expect that to trend over time thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure ph brian good morning obviously the fed is hiking at a lot faster pace than any of us anticipated when we started the quarter and started the year when we look at the mix of deposits on our balance sheet and some of the actions that weve taken this quarter to move out of some highcost funding when we look at the next several hikes and think about what the impact of a 25basis point increase might be we look more towards to basis points increase in net interest margin for each thats on an annualized basis and net interest income growth in the million to million range and looking at that the kind of range of reactivities that weve sensitized is to its kind of how were thinking about it and what were seeing again based on the mix of deposits on our portfolio q thats really helpful though thank you and in light of the changes you made to some of your highcost funding sources i was wondering if you could just talk about your overall deposit growth expectations through yearend darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp well when you look at mt and our funding we have one of the higher what i would call core funding portfolios amongst our peers and amongst the banks and so a significant portion is in noninterestbearing dda as well as interest checking which tend to be operational accounts and so when we look at those accounts whether its consumer small business or commercial customers we do expect that there will be some decline as people continue to spend given the rate of inflation but so far the decline weve been watching has been fairly gradual we have seen some commercial customers use some of the excess cash to pay down loans thats part of when you see some of the loan declines were seeing that offset by payoffs or by them using the cash and really the place where you start to see the most price sensitivity in the shortterm tends to be as we mentioned earlier in the municipal deposit space as well as in the wealth customer space and so well expect to see some movement there and typically what happens ph brian is theres some instances where the actual pricing goes up on interest checking or savings and money market but generally what happens first particularly in the consumer space is you start to see balances migrate towards time deposits and so part of what well see for us and we would expect for the industry is the migration towards time deposits and that will be what kind of drives the overall beta for deposit costs more so than any one particular category of deposits moving up in a rapid pace mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 and so just given the nature of our deposit base we expect some decline but we dont expect it to be excessive from here maybe in the to range but really not that much q thank you operator our next question comes from john pancari evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just on the loan growth front i appreciate the guide for the to on average total balances just want to see if you can maybe give a little color in terms of the trajectory of the commercial real estate portfolio is it fair to assume that declines are going to continue i know you kind of alluded to that and would it be outright declines in the balances or just a shrinking in the overall mix but you could actually see growth there thanks darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so looking at commercial in aggregate i think its important to look at the two in aggregate we think theyll be relatively close to flat the growth in ci exppp will offset whats likely to be a decline in cre and when we look at the cre balances and whats happening there theres really two things going on the first which weve been talking about for a while is construction loans are on the decline and so we had back in and some real growth in construction lines that over the course of and and have been drawn down as projects have been underway you did see a little delay in the pandemic but projects got back on track and as those come to completion theyll follow their normal course where they will get converted into permanent mortgages and that often happens off of our balance sheet and so we continue to expect some decline in construction balances on the permanent side as i mentioned we have seen some payoffs from customers using cash we havent using their cash their excess cash and declining their balances the level of activity that you typically see in the cre space continues to be low with rates moving its affecting cap rates and asset values and so youre starting youre not seeing the turnover in properties like you might have under normal circumstances and that will affect the pace of decline andor our growth in permanent cre and so what we saw this quarter if i look at loan originations in the quarter across ci and cre it was actually our best postpandemic nonfourth quarter lots of qualifiers there increase in originations which i thought was a very positive sign and it was a little bit weighted towards the back end of the quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 and so i guess think about permanent mortgages down slightly construction mortgages down a little bit more over the course of the year which probably takes in dollars maybe billion down call it to offset by growth in ci john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks darren and then separately just on the buyback front it was good to see the new billion authorization how should we think about the pace of buybacks here is it fair to assume a similar pace as what you saw in the second quarter of million or could you actually get some acceleration in the pace of repurchases in coming quarters darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure the best way to think about it john is to think about that million as a good pace it could accelerate depending on how fast rates move and whats happening with net interest income growth and capital generation weve got one quarter to go through with some of the merger expenses coming through which will affect capital so we could move it up a little bit or down a little bit off that million but i think for purposes of looking forward thats a good pace to think about john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right thanks darren operator well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess one wanted to followup on the nii guide for up just wanted to make sure given all the moving pieces around the balance sheet we have this right it implies an exit fourth quarter run rate north of billion just want to make sure that sounds reasonable in terms of how we think about what the jumping off point is for and if you dont mind reminding us how much of purchase accounting accretion do you expect in the back half and maybe if you have an updated number for next year as well darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp sure so to answer your first question the billion run rate at the end of the year is a good number to use obviously ill caveat that and keep in mind that thats based on the forward curve and lots of assumptions on as mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 we mentioned about deposit betas but i think thats a reasonable number and then the second question remind me again what that was im sorry im losing my mind already ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just in terms of how much of purchase accounting accretion is there in the numbers for darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp right sorry yeah purchase accounting the number that you saw in the second quarter that we talked about the million is a good start point i mean obviously over time that winds its way down and so as you think about think about four quarters of purchase accounting accretion versus three this year but kind of the million to million a quarter run rate is a good place to be there ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just a separate followup on the cre side as we think about obviously youve talked about in the past in terms of just thinking about how much to balance sheet versus not and i think you had an announcement of some appointments within the cre business a couple of days ago i would love to hear your updated thoughts one coming out of the stress test any surprises anything that you think you would tweak as a function of the stress test and then just where are we in terms of the evolution of the new strategy around cre as you think about that business darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think the short answer is the path that were on and our thought process around cre hasnt changed when we look at i guess a couple comments on the stress test we were pleased to see the decline in loss rates from the pandemic stress test in cre down to from however if you look at an even earlier stress test they kind of averaged around or for cre so its still pretty elevated from that and when we look at our own performance over time in the cre space we cant get anywhere near that number and whats really interesting is when you look over the last two years at the pandemic that was pretty much a real live stress test on cre without much support from the government and the losses there were pretty minimal and so when we think about our underwriting were really comfortable with the underwriting when we think about our experience in the space we think weve got a really talented group of individuals that operate there and that we can use those skillsets to continue to support our customers and maybe use others balance sheets who are actually looking for the kind of skillsets that we have in underwriting and so theres a great match there where we can take advantage of our skillset we can provide funding and capital for our customers and be there for them and maybe even offer them a broader range of alternatives and make it more capitalefficient over time where we can convert some of those loan balances and dollars into fee income which will free up capital and so the path that weve been on we feel really good about you noted weve added some folks we added some folks in what we call our innovation office weve also added a couple players in our cre capital markets area of the bank youll probably hear a little bit more about that in the coming weeks and we slowly start to build out the team and slowly increase the mix or the percentage that ends up onbalance sheet and off its still not quite at a point where you can see it in the noninterest income numbers but that will build as we go through the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 rest of this year and into and so i guess longwinded way of saying no change in the strategy but hopefully some of that color helps give context to why were on the path that were on ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from matt oconnor from deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning sorry about that darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey matt youre on mute matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc pretty explicit expense guidance this year and obviously cost saves coming in over the next several quarters as we think about next year and kind of just underlying expense growth given some of the putsandtakes with inflation and theres always some kind of expense component tied to credit which might normalize a little bit but just the bottom line is how do you think about kind of more mediumterm underlying expense growth darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp wow matt youre way ahead of me were still getting geared up to do our planning here but once we get through lets start with and the path that were on the guide that we gave was on a net operating basis so it excludes the merger expenses and should start to give you an idea of what the run rate might look like as we exit what i would suggest to you is as we go through the system conversion this third quarter thats a key moment in some of the final pieces of expense reduction and so there will be systems contracts and decommissioning expenses that will go on and those dont happen immediately sometimes that takes a month or two there will be folks that we will retain from the acquired institution that that can be systems conversion plus days plus plus and so some of the expense saves will bleed a little bit into the fourth quarter and maybe slightly into the first but we should be getting towards the real run rate by the end of the first quarter it should be pretty solid and it shouldnt be much different from where we exit the fourth outside of that when you get to our philosophy about expenses and the investments that were making our history has always been to pay close attention to the efficiency ratio and the expenses to make sure that the technology investments that were making improve productivity which provide an expense save and historically weve been in the kind of to growth rate in expenses on a normalized basis might be at the higher end of that because of inflation sometimes you can end up at the lower end of that if inflation is zero but its not something where we expect to see midsingle digits numbers like weve seen over the last couple years i think theres some extenuating circumstances that led us there but over the long run thats mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 kind of how we expect to run the bank and we do it to achieve positive operating leverage over the long run thats our goal matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful and then just followingup on some of the capital questions kind of longerterm how much buffer do you want over the regulatory minimum i mean its pretty clear youre hoping to drive down the regulatory minimum over time obviously ending this year at is a big buffer but whats the thought on how much youd want to hold over the regulatory minimum thank you darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure matt i mean when we look at our capital targets we take into account our own internal stress test analysis and losses under stress as well as the insight we get from the ccar and the stress test and the thing to keep in mind with the scb is every two years that number can change and so we got to be careful about setting the place we want our capital ratio to be based on any one years test the other part that i think is important to keep in mind especially with the test of the last couple years is how the fed models take into account balance sheet size and what that does for expense growth and ppnr and operational risk and so within that stress capital buffer theres credit losses and then theres these other factors that drive that up and so those will also change as we go through time and so you think about the work that were doing to deploy the cash into securities which will help in the next ccar the work were doing on construction lending balances and the impact that can have on loss rates in cre as well as just the reduction in cre many of the factors and things that were focused on are intended to help reduce losses and ppnr negative impact in the stress test which should help bring that capital buffer down over time and so the that we talked about for this year is really as we enter into january of when well go through the stress test again which normally thats an offyear for a category bank but itll be the first year we go through on a combined basis now we actually think the peoples portfolio is helpful to our losses under stress because their cre portfolio is a little more skewed towards permanent mortgages which tend to have a lower loss under stress and so that we also think will be helpful for the scb next year and so weve always talked about operating at the low end of the peer range in the bottom quartile the top end of the bottom quartile in terms of cet1 ratio given our underwriting history and our loss history we expect to move in that direction but we want to get through the end of this year and through that first test on a combined basis with some buffer and then continue to bring things down into the range that we talked about matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 hi darren darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sticking with capital for a minute obviously your stress capital buffer this year was extraordinarily high it didnt seem to be the right number compared to your risk in your organization i hope its not any retribution to one of bobs letters back in in the annual report about the regulators but anyway aside from that can you share with us what strategies you may try to implement to show the regulators next year when you go through the stress exam as you just pointed out how to bring that number down to a more reasonable level darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah sure gerard i guess just starting with the test the thing to keep in mind is i think the stress tests were put in place by the fed at a very unique time in the history of the country and some challenges that the banks were having and was put in place to give people confidence in the system and its a good process its never going to be perfect and each year the fed stresses certain parts of the asset base based on whats going on in the country and the last couple years its been focused on commercial real estate and so as an organization that has historically had a concentration in commercial real estate when thats the focus the pain is felt a little disproportionately at banks like mt as i mentioned earlier if we look at our history of underwriting and actual losses were very comfortable with the asset class but its clear that were going to we cant operate with the size of portfolio relative to the peers that we have in the past and so thats why we talk about the work were doing to continue to support our customers which is the most important thing that were going to be there for them but that were going to think about different ways to do that and so construction loans our construction portfolio probably got a little big and that will come down naturally as weve talked about and then as we go forward well look to move towards a slightly better balance of ci and consumer loans in addition to commercial real estate and so that should help overall in the test just because construction loans are one of the higher loss categories what part of the portfolio could be stressed next year it could be something else it could be ci or it could be mortgage and that will lead to a different outcome the other thing though that i think is important to keep in mind is as quantitative tightening happens and deposits come out of the system thats going to reduce balance sheets reduced balance sheets will reduce that expense growth that i mentioned earlier in the test and will reduce operational losses and those will also have the effect of reducing the size of the scb and for mt in particular keep in mind that when we went through the test this year we had the highest level of cash on our balance sheet of anyone in the system and in the test the cash value at the fed when because the test always drops fed funds to zero produces zero net interest income and so you have the benefit of the earning assets driving the expense but not the benefit of any income that comes with them and so as we see those balances shrink and we start to invest a little bit more in securities and those fixed rate securities that will help generate a little bit more ppnr over the through the test and so all of these things are pieces of the puzzle and actions that were taking to help improve that capital buffer and bring it down closer to where we all might expect it to be and itll take time but thats were on a path mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 weve talked about the path were on to bring down the capital ratios while maintaining an appropriate cushion to where the scb suggests we need to be and well continue to work on the balance sheet to help drive that scb number down which will continue to give us the opportunity to generate capital invest it in growth in the franchise and if not distribute it to shareholders in a friendly way gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the thorough answer as a followup question on credit obviously your credit metrics on net chargeoffs are through the cycle amongst the best if not the best of the regionals the equity markets seem to have discounted the bank stocks in anticipation of rising credit losses and problems coming from the tightening policies of the fed can you share with us are you guys seeing any evidence yet of earlystage delinquency starting to creep up in certain parts of your franchise or certain product types that there is some weakness developing or is it no its still all clear and maybe its something next year that we have to anticipate darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp when we look at credit if i look at the various portfolios if i start with the consumer portfolios consumer delinquency whether its in mortgage indirect auto rec fi credit card home equity delinquency rates still are below prepandemic levels and when i look at the mt portfolio in particular weve never been in a place that does subprime and the percentage of nearprime customers is also very low and the last thing we see across all of those portfolios is ltvs are also at lows with the increase in value of automobiles as well as home price inflation over the last couple years ltvs are very low and so so far not a lot of delinquency and good collateral coverage and so nothing that were seeing as signs in those portfolios within the ci and cre space its nuanced and its a function of in ci whats happening with input costs for ci customers and how strong is their ability to pass on price increases to their end customer and so weve seen some instances where weve moved some credits on to our watch list where input costs have risen faster than pricing and thats led to some decreases in debt service coverage and so weve moved some people onto our watch list within the real estate portfolio whats interesting is its a bit of a remixing and so weve seen a real strong improvement in hotel nois were seeing people travel again in fact and one of the things in our expenses i could see our travel and entertainment expense was up as an organization i think thats a true statement for many organizations across the country which is a positive sign for our urban hotel portfolio and were seeing that in the numbers and so as those get better were seeing some still continue to see some challenges in the healthcare sector which is you think about assisted living acute care and elective surgery theres still some lower occupancy levels theyre up off of the pandemic lows but theyre better and office continues to be a watch for us as people come back to the office again when we look at our own staff were seeing more people in the office but its not back to prepandemic levels and i think thats also true across the country so were seeing no improved performance in retail and hotel within the real estate space and still some challenges in the healthcare and office space and so not really a change in aggregate but a shift in where our focus is so i wouldnt give the allclear signal that would be very unmt like were always worried and looking for where the next issue could be but theres nothing thats flashing red right now that says that theres a big crisis coming in the next several quarters mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and darren in the ci portfolio is there much leveraged finance obviously spreads have widened in that category in particular darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp we have leveraged finance in there but its a small percentage of the portfolio i think on a combined basis its call it in the billion of outstandings maybe billion of commitments maybe billion to billion in that space which given the size of the bank now is a pretty small percentage of our total assets and when we look at what the grading on those is still pretty strong even with rates where they are gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you so much operator operator instructions well take our next question from erika najarian from ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi just one followup for me this is actually a followup to the first question youre expecting some decline it sounds like in your core accounts given inflationary pressures and whats interesting is pretty much all of your peers have talked about growing deposits from second quarter levels i guess a twopart question number one how much more in surge deposits do you have left i guess im trying to figure out how conservative the underlying deposit growth assumptions are underneath that guide for nii darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i guess as you look through the deposit portfolio ill go back to the comments from before the bulk of our deposit base are what we refer to as operational accounts and so its where our business banking customers our commercial customers and our consumers are running their daily lives from those accounts there are surge balances in there were not seeing them run out really in any dramatic pace the reason we kind of went through the painstaking task of explaining all the deposit changes was to get to this point that were not seeing dramatic runoff in our core accounts there is a challenge that we see for many of our consumers where the pace of inflation is running faster than the pace of wage growth but they still have lots of deposits from the various stimulus programs and things that happened during the crisis and so we believe that those balances will come down but theyll come down gradually and really the question on deposit decline is for customers who have excess balances beyond what they can use some will get deployed to pay down debt like we talked about with some of our commercial customers using some cash to pay down loans and then the other thing will be how many folks will look for a rate for excess balances and given our excess liquidity position relative to the peers how much do we want to pay out and for what types of customers and so what we tend to do is we look at the depth of the relationship and then if you have a broader relationship with the bank we would be willing to do more for you on your loan pricing or on your deposit pricing and if youre a single service time account looking for a rate given the excess liquidity we probably wont match some of the rates that are out there and similar thing will be true on the commercial side mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 and so its really a function i think erika of the difference between the level of our cash position and the percentage of our balance sheet that sits in cash versus the peers that might cause that difference but were not anticipating by any stretch any rapid depletion of those core accounts erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i understand so just to interpret that darren making sure im thinking about it correctly you have so much cash that your sensitivity is greater for those that are seeking higher yield is that a good way to think about it darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i guess i would say we will be relationshiporiented and total relationshipfocused on the places where we will give rate for people that are seeking it and that will keep those balances on our balance sheet and for folks that are just kind of what i would describe as renting our balance sheet well be a little bit less sensitive and those balances could well run off and were in the fortunate position of being able to have that selectivity because of the excess cash that we have erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning darren darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hi frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just wondering i hate to beat the dead horse on the capital and the stress test side but even if you set aside the relatively larger prebalances it looks like mts assumed loan losses in the severely adverse scenario is basically higher than the median and almost across categories despite what you pointed to and what is obviously a stronger credit history overall just wondering if youve been able to gather any more color on is it a regional thing what the fed is sort of thinking that makes their loss assumptions so much more punitive than you guys would assume darren j king a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah frank when you look under the hood the most important thing to remember is theres no loss rate applied to any mt portfolio by the fed thats different from what they apply to anyone else with a similar portfolio right and so all of this is a function of mix and what i think the fed found if i remember this correctly over the course mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2022 of the last couple years in the difference between the pandemic test where the results came out in december versus this most recent one was that the loss rates that were being assumed in some categories notably hotel and retail was nuanced and in the first test it was a little bit more blunt that there was more trauma in that whole sector and that would lead to much lower asset values and so you couldnt rely on the collateral in this last test what i think the fed did was they were more nuanced and they could see that suburban hotels ones that you could drive to resortoriented hotel properties had seen increases in occupancy as people started to travel again and that led to better asset values and collateral values under stress and where they tended to apply more was in the urban areas where it was still we still havent seen the recovery in business travel and conventions and weddings in those large properties and so the loss rates were applied there and when you look at mt and some of our real estate portfolio particularly in the hotel we obviously have new york city we have some in boston we have some in philadelphia and washington and so those properties at mt would have faced a little bit more stress and that would help lead to that higher loss rate ph and that seemed to be a good place i think there was still a little bit of stress on retail and some beginning on office i think they were looking a little bit more with a little bit more scrutiny at what we consider b and cgrade office buildings and applied a little bit tougher test to the asset values in those categories it gives us more insight into how the fed thinks about things gives us more questions for us to think about in how we consider those property types but again to me the positive is when you look at even with those loss rates and our capital levels were still above basis points above the minimum under that stress and with the other comments i made about impact to ppnr and so when we look at the capital ratios of the bank and where we sit we feel really good and the fed just helped us confirm that we can withstand a pretty severe downturn in some of these asset classes and still be in great shape and so we continue to learn through the process and make the adjustments that we talked about before to the balance sheet to be as capitalefficient as we can be frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for all the color thats all i had operator operator instructions and it appears we have no further questions at this time i will now turn the program back over to our speakers brian klock executive vice
