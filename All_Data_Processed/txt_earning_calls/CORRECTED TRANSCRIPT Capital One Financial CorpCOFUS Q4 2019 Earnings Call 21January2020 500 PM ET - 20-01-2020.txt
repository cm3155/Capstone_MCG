earnings per share were for in the fourth quarter net income was billion or per share net of adjusting items our eps in the quarter was per share we had three adjusting items in the quarter which are outlined on slide of our earnings presentation first we had a million or per share expense of launch and integration costs associated with our walmart partnership this brings the fullyear total expense to million and concludes the onetime expenses related to the walmart partnership launch additionally we had an allowance reserve build for the acquired capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 walmart portfolio of million or per share the reserve build as well as the launch and integration costs are recorded in our domestic card business lastly we had million of charges related to the cyber incident that we announced at the end of july these charges were partially offset by an insurance reimbursement receivable of million resulting in a net impact of million or per share we continue to expect the portion of the charges and insurance recoveries will extend beyond in addition to the adjusting items we recognized million in costs related to the redemption of our series c and d preferred stock on december we also had an incremental million of dividend expense associated with the cost of carrying the new series i issuance in addition to series c and d for most of the quarter collectively these costs decreased q4 earnings per share by as a reminder preferred dividends impact eps but they do not impact net income moving on to quarterly performance relative to a year ago adjusted preprovision earnings increased with revenue increasing operating expenses increasing and marketing decreasing by compared to the prioryear quarter provision for credit losses increased to owing to a larger allowance build and a modest increase in chargeoffs let me take a moment to discuss the quarterly movements in our allowance across our businesses which are detailed in table of our earnings supplement our card business saw an allowance build of million essentially flat outside of the million initial allowance reserve build for the acquired walmart portfolio in our consumer business there was a build of million driven by continued growth in our auto business and lastly reserves in our commercial business declined by million as chargeoffs in the quarter more than offset builds in allowance related to our energy portfolio december marked the end of the allowance accounting that we have all known for decades we estimate that the adoption of cecl will increase our allowance by approximately billion and reduce our cet1 ratio by basis points in the first quarter we have broken out the cecl allowance transition impacts by reported segment on slide turning to slide net interest margin was in the quarter and for the full year of relative to the prior quarter net interest margin was largely flat on a linkedquarter basis net interest margin increased basis points or basis points excluding the negative impact in q3 from uk ppi the basis points of improvement was partly driven by asset mix including the onboarding of the walmart portfolio in the quarter which reduced cash and securities and partly by the effects of seasonal loan growth we continue to have a relatively neutral nearterm posture to interest rate changes over the longer term persistently low interest rates will be a headwind for us and the industry turning to slide i will cover capital our common equity tier capital ratio on a basel iii standardized basis this quarter was in the fourth quarter we purchased approximately million or million capital one common shares weve now completed approximately billion of our ccar authorization of billion recall that in october the fed finalized the tailoring rule with an expected implementation in the first quarter of when we adopt the rule we expect to opt out of aoci for regulatory capital purposes as a result on december we transferred our held to maturity securities to available for sale resulting in an aoci increase of approximately million inclusive of this transfer our december aoci position for afs securities capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 increased cet1 in the fourth quarter by about basis points accordingly when we opt out of aoci in the first quarter q1 cet1 will decrease by about basis points all else equal as we are preparing for ccar we still believe that our longterm capital need is around cet1 let me take a minute to talk about the factors impacting our capital need in the ccar the feds implementation of a new credit loss model created a headwind to our capital under stress conversely the effects of the recently finalized tailoring rule will provide a tailwind to our capital reduction under stress we also believe theres an opportunity for further capital relief under the stress capital buffer framework and we continue to keep an eye on the feds implementation of cecl which will occur in ccar how and when the fed implements these changes in ccar will be a key factor in when we will be able to manage our cet1 closer to the longterm capital need with that let me turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp thanks scott ill begin on slide which summarizes fourth quarter results for our credit card business the credit card business delivered solid results with stable credit and strong growth in loans purchase volume and revenue credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business which is shown on slide domestic card ending loan balances increased by billion or yearoveryear driven by the addition of the acquired walmart portfolio and strong growth of branded cards partially offset by our choice to exit several small partnership portfolios in the second quarter branded card loans which exclude all private label and co branded cards grew from the prioryear quarter domestic card average loans for the quarter were up compared to the fourth quarter of we posted another strong quarter of purchase volume growth as we continued to grow our heavy spender franchise year overyear domestic card purchase volume growth was net interchange revenue for the total company grew revenue increased from the fourth quarter of driven by the growth in average loans revenue margin declined basis points more than of the decline was driven by the revenuesharing agreement on the acquired walmart portfolio noninterest expense was essentially flat compared to the prioryear quarter domestic card credit remained strong and stable the chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear driven by the addition of the acquired walmart portfolio because the delinquency rate is not affected by the losssharing agreement the addition of the walmart portfolio put upward pressure on the fourth quarter 30plus delinquency rate despite this upward pressure the 30plus delinquency rate improved basis points from the end of the prioryear quarter to pulling up our domestic card business continued to deliver strong results with topline growth and strong and stable credit slide summarizes fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business ending loans increased yearoveryear average loans for the fourth quarter grew from the prioryear quarter our auto business delivered strong yearoveryear originations growth and a modest acceleration of loan growth along with stable credit results and loan yields all in a marketplace with increasing competitive intensity digital innovation is a key driver of our momentum in the auto business powered by our national banking strategy ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 average deposit interest rate for the quarter increased basis points compared to the prioryear quarter the rate increase was primarily a result of a product mix shift toward higher rate deposit products throughout the year the deposit interest rate declined basis points from the sequential quarter driven by the market interest rate environment our average deposit rate paid going forward will depend on several factors including the market interest rate environment our deposit mix our funding needs and competitive dynamics consumer banking revenue decreased from the fourth quarter of last year underlying revenue growth from higher auto loans and retail deposits was more than offset by two effects differences in the timing of federal reserve rate cuts versus our deposit pricing moves pressured revenue in the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter of included a small tail of revenue from the legacy home loans and investing businesses there was no revenue from these legacy businesses in the fourth quarter of this year noninterest expense was up volumedriven growth in expenses and our continuing investments to grow and transform were partially offset by the lack of expenses from the legacy businesses fourth quarter provision for credit losses increased million yearoveryear auto loan growth drove an allowance build the auto chargeoff rate improved basis points compared to the prioryear quarter to better than expected auction values and the benign economy continue to support strong auto credit we continue to expect that the annual auto chargeoff rate will gradually increase as the cycle plays out moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business ending loan balances were up yearover year quarterly average loan balances were up compared to the fourth quarter a year ago average deposits increased fourth quarter revenue was up from the prioryear quarter driven by growth in average loan balances and strong noninterest income noninterest expense was up compared to the prior year quarter provision for credit losses increased compared to the fourth quarter of driven by our energy portfolio the commercial banking chargeoff rate for the fourth quarter was and criticized loan rates were relatively stable compared to both the prior year and sequential quarters the criticized performing loan rate for the fourth quarter was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was in our commercial banking business were keeping a watchful eye on market conditions unregulated competitors continue to put pressure on pricing loan spreads and loan terms against that backdrop were carefully choosing our spots and staying disciplined in our underwriting and origination choices pulling way up in the fourth quarter and for the full year capital one continued to post solid results as we invest to grow and to drive our digital transformation our marketing investments continue to build momentum across our businesses in domestic card we generated strong yearoveryear growth in purchase volume and solid growth in loans credit results were strong and stable and we successfully launched the walmart partnership in consumer banking our auto business delivered solid loan growth with stable credit and loan yields and our national banking strategy achieved strong yearoveryear growth in retail deposits looking ahead marketing will as always depend upon our continuous assessment of opportunities in the competitive marketplace as we enter we continue to see resilient growth opportunities in all of our businesses and well have a full year of marketing for the new walmart partnership with the momentum we have capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 in domestic cards and national retail banking plus the incremental walmart marketing we expect full year marketing expense will be moderately higher than full year marketing expense we remain allin on our technology transformation and our progress continues we are realizing significant and growing benefits across the company faster to market better products better customer experience better risk management more growth better economics were on the home stretch of our transition to the cloud and were on track to exit our data centers near the end of this year until then we continue to operate with one foot in the legacy data center environment and one foot in the cloud along the way were working hard to improve operating efficiency even with the elevated costs of straddling both the data center and cloud environments in we posted a basis point improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments and we expect to achieve another year of modest improvement in we continue to expect a bigger move down in annual operating efficiency ratio to in net of adjustments we expect the larger improvement in to be aided by the full exit of the data centers and the associated costs of straddling two environments increased traction in our businesses enhanced by technology and the stepup in revenue share on the acquired walmart portfolio which will occur in the fourth quarter of we continue to expect that the improvement in annual operating efficiency ratio will drive significant improvement in annual total efficiency ratio by as well as the many benefits from our technology transformation continue and increase we are wellpositioned to succeed in a rapidly changing marketplace and create longterm shareholder value now scott and i will be happy to answer your questions jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any additional followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call matt please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp good evening ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey rich maybe just to start off a question for scott so thank you for the moving pieces on cecl across the different products i guess now that day one is behind us any color you can give us regarding the day two impact and maybe can you just talk about it across each of the different portfolios and i have one followup richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp yeah sure well when i think about day two im going to start off by just saying we gave segmentlevel multiples and i think they are a good foundation for you to use those multiples and apply them to what you would have been estimating under the prior regime for allowance builds in so i think thats in general a good place to start in terms of thinking about day two i think that the multiple that we have talked about could change gradually if performance the portfolio performance or the portfolio mix really changes in the future but i think those are going to be changes that happen over time so the transition multiples are probably a good place to start ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and rich maybe just a question on both operating and overall efficiency so you made nice progress in despite a handful of headwinds i guess what are the biggest swing factors that could impact reaching or is it the fact that everything is coming offline in the fourth quarter that you have such a high degree of confidence and then i guess second just given where we are in the cycle you talked about marketing being up moderately this year is there a scenario where you could see it accelerating or would you expect us to remain at around these levels plus or minus like you articulated in your outlook thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp so ryan lets talk about the operating efficiency ratio were like a year into when we set this guidance and it was certainly a stepping out of character for capital one to be so specific and so many years out and as we had talked all along the way there are several things that have driven our confidence there are certain things that are to call them math is a little bit understating the sort of incredible work associated with doing it but in a sense getting out of the data centers is something that with the extraordinary achievement of doing it we have a capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 i think a very good handle on what the costs of what straddling those environments have been and what the benefit of just being allin on the cloud is the math of the walmart stepup that is what it is thats contractual and so i think thats a very reliable thing the another thing that aids the continued improvement here and the larger improvement in is the increased traction that we expect in our businesses that we can in fact see unfolding and that we expect to continue obviously that has uncertainty around it like any estimate of future business performance and growth but a lot of that is sort of in the works it can be affected by changes in the marketplace changes in the economy changes in choices that we make but this is the product of a bunch of work that we have been doing the success of our marketing and account origination in prior years which weve spent a lot of time talking about and the some of the technology innovation that has been going on so we feel good about that obviously that has uncertainty to it and the other element in the uncertainty equation is what happens to operating costs of one minus the data center exit and all the associated costs of straddling that will be eliminated and there can always be risks to cost estimates but weve spent weve worked very hard and this is not like a new thing weve worked hard for years driving gradually driving down the efficiency ratio and being very disciplined on operating costs we do have some growing benefit that comes on the technology side here with respect to technology cost savings and collectively when we put all that together while as always there is uncertainty in this here we are we had our bold shingle that we hung out a year ago here we are a year into it and we feel as good as we did at the time that we launched it and im pretty struck by in a world where so many things change how what we had in mind is continuing to unfold and thats because its the product of a lot of work for a long period of time with respect to marketing the first thing i want to say is we dont give precise well in most years in many ways we dont even give marketing guidance at all and we what i would say about marketing is and the impression i want to leave you with is we continue to feel very good about our marketing investments in card marketing is strengthening our heavy spender franchise driving strong new account originations growth in purchase volume net interchange revenue loans on the bank side the increased marketing is fueling deposit growth along with cafe and brand awareness were seeing a lot of traction just overall in our brand metrics and brand equities that are critical to building a franchise and also were a company that doesnt have branches were a company that actually isnt at the top of the league table in terms of cobrand partnerships and a lot of things so we have to build our business the old fashioned way kind of one customer at a time and our marketing machine is a key part of that so what i would leave you with is we continue to feel very good about the marketing yeah we got a new addition here in terms of a full year of the walmart marketing and so thats going to be yet another factor that pulls up the numbers there theres always we will always make our final determinations based on the opportunities and necessities that we see in the marketplace but i wanted to just give you that general window into how were feeling about the marketing jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator your next question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i wanted to follow up on the day two cecl impact scott when you look at the street consensus provisions out there and im just looking at our own were assuming 6ish loan growth flat chargeoffs and we have the provision of i mean does that look commensurate to sort of what youre articulating or is it something else richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp sanjay why dont i just step back and give you a little bit of a picture of whats going to happen with cecl so just to go back and ground out how cecl is going to work allowance movements under cecl are really driven by the same factors that drove the allowance under the prior regime so you start off with loan balances at the end of the period you got expected future losses and recoveries on balances and then we have qualitative factors that are not captured in our modeling and we add those on top of those three factors its really the second one that changes under cecl and because were now going to be holding an allowance for the expected lifetime losses and importantly were also going to be having the lifetime recoveries and thats ill come to that in just a minute as to why thats such an important factor so thats the biggest step change under cecl so let me kind of just put this together for you and tell you how were going to do it we start with a 12month loss outlook which we forecast we then extend that into a lifetime forecast and when we do that we assume a gradual reversion of losses to historical averages after that first year and then we overlay that with huge recoveries and future recoveries are a big offset to our cecl allowance prior to cecl we offset our allowance with expected recoveries for only the next months with cecl well be offsetting our allowance with all estimated future recoveries and relatively speaking recoveries have a larger offsetting impact under cecl than they did under the prior allowance regime because we tend to see a longer tail of recoveries on our chargeoffs so net of all of that i think youre going to see a multiple on our allowance in our domestic card business at the point of transition multiple for our auto business and as i mentioned in my first answer i think those are relatively stable your question about well how might this look in periods of stability and in periods of growth let me just kind of answer that real quick in periods of stability youre really just going to have take that multiple and apply it to whatever allowance build that you are thinking about and that includes moderate growth and a stable economy theres a couple things that could cause that implied cecl multiple to vary over time and let me give you a couple examples so the first is that as you know and weve talked about cecl pulls forward the allowance expense associated with new lending and so all else equal our implied cecl multiple would probably go up in periods of higher growth and just to give you a bit of a sensitivity there during our growth surge in to the implied multiple during that period if we had lived under cecl would have been higher perhaps in the range so just to give you a sense like theres a lot of things that could move around but if we just kind of took hindsight and applied kind of where we see things we could see the multiple going up into that range capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 on the flip side of that in periods of high recoveries you could actually see the multiple go down so in periods immediately after a downturn where theres higher weve got this big portfolio of recoveries those might actually start to be a bigger factor and push the ultimate multiple down so i know that was a bit of a long answer but hopefully that gives you a sense of kind of the moving pieces of how cecl is going to work day two sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you i have one followup just on the walmart portfolio i know it was known to have a lower tender share penetration i was wondering if thats a big growth opportunity in and a contributor in card growth and then just a clarification on the marketing expense outlook for would this years growth be moderately higher was that a good comparison in terms of the growth rate thank you richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp sorry could you repeat the second question sanjay your clarification question sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes yes yeah on the marketing expense growth you mentioned moderately higher i was just wondering if 2019s growth rate would be commensurate with moderately higher it was like midsingledigits growth richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp okay so i think what we have this year is a continuation of the momentum that we had last year and i want to say also to my response to ryan nashs opening question that and one of the important drivers of is the continuing traction in the business and marketing is a very important element of that and in fact so we a way to think about it is we start with an opportunity in a sense a growing opportunity on the marketing side consistent with what were seeing overlay that with walmart which is a new thing and those two things together is what is driving our guidance of a moderate increase in marketing jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp rich do you want to talk about this question on the growth opportunity from richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp growth opportunity in the walmart portfolio yeah let me say its certainly an honor and an opportunity to partner with not only the worlds largest retailer actually the worlds largest company a fortune company and to launch a digitalfirst card program so for capital one the opportunity divides itself into a back book where we have converted the old synchrony back book and weve told you a lot about the size and the general parameters associated with that and then there will over time be a growing front book that will be the originations that we do under this new partnership were not going to be specifically guiding to that front book because in many ways this will have a lot of similarity to many of the front book things that we do at capital one certainly the size of walmart and at capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 this point the relative to other partnerships at the penetration levels of the credit card relationships there is certainly upside there and i think walmart certainly believes that and so do we but were in the very early stages of this but i think we are very pleased with the way our two companies are partnering here jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thanks next question please operator and your next question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks you referred to a growth in the branded cards that that i think was the same number that you referenced in the third quarter so roughly the same level as growth could you just talk a little bit about what the kind of the outlook is i mean because that does exclude walmart so talk a little bit about whether that branded growth is going to be accelerating or decelerating and the impact maybe on overall growth from walmart and i do have a followup richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp yeah moshe so first of all the front book of since it starts at zero the front book by definition will be a growing book i also want to point out the back book of walmart with the loss rate that it has is a runoff portfolio thats running off at a pretty sizable clip relative to portfolios otherwise that we have so there are going to be two forces going in opposite directions there and well have to see how that plays out but were certainly very happy to have that partnership the outlook look i think we continue to feel good about the growth opportunities in the card business but i think its more a continuation of the story that weve been talking about before in terms of were benefited by a number of years of strong account origination we have been over time increasing credit line as we have validated each successive vintage is coming in as good as it is and in fact if anything the recent vintages are outperforming in a good way by a bit some of the earlier vintage so all that is good that gives us the confidence to continue to drive the originations and also the continuing confidence on the credit line side now this is all in the context of an economy thats already the longest in length in recorded history here between recessions but so with a cautious eye at the environment the things that weve been talking about for a number of quarters are continuing to find traction and that and a very important element of that is the success of the marketing so thats why we feel good about the growth opportunity moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you and just as a followup a little bit of housekeeping noninterest income outside of interchange revenue and service fees kind of that other line was up very nicely both from the third quarter and a year ago was that primarily just the change in the absence of ppi charge or are there other factors as well richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 moshe can you just which specific line item are you looking at moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc what you guys have called kind of other income was up like kind of in q3 and or so from a year ago richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp right yeah moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc but i believe both of those had the ppi charges in them but richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp yeah so a few things that impact that line item so other noninterest income really is driven by oftentimes marks on a variety of different situations so the first is we actually had some compensationrelated assets that weve marked and we take the benefit of those marks runs through this line item in revenue and theres an offsetting expense that runs through and elevates ph fcnb so in the period with the runoff in the market there was a pretty healthy amount of mark on compensation the other thing that runs through there we do occasionally have partner payments that are coming in under the contracts those can run through there and be a bit lumpy i think that the level that youre seeing in q4 is a bit elevated to what i would expect on a run rate basis jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator your next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just switching gears a little bit talking about nim i know that nim went up nicely in the quarter and which i think you had a comment in your prepared remarks around how lower rates are a little bit of a headwind so i just capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 want to square those two things and understand how youre thinking about the outlook for nim you had a nice decline in the deposit cost so maybe you could speak to that a little bit richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp betsy as i mentioned last quarter we have been talking for a number of quarters about headwinds from deposit mix and deposit pricing and we had started to see those abate a little bit last quarter when i look at nim this quarter i mentioned that there were two primary factors that drove nim up on a linkedquarter basis one of those was asset mix which was the larger of the two factors that i described the other was the other factor was seasonal loan growth so were seeing a bit of that traction in there the costs deposit pricing is embedded in that as well as things like accelerated amortization on the premiums that we have some of the securities all of thats embedded in there so overall i think that when it comes to the impact of deposit pricing our betas have been relatively low since the declining rate cycle started that may be an opportunity rich mentioned the types of factors that would drive where deposit pricing goes so i think well have to see where that moves to but at this point i dont really see any outsized impactors whether positively or negative on our net interest margin betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then so mix really driving the bus on that when i think about the cecl outlook here and i know youd already talked about day two quite a bit i just wanted to see if you could give us some color around the commercial banking increase in your day one i asked just because some of the other folks that we look at had declines in commercial so i wanted to understand what was driving a little bit of a different outcome for you richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp it is so hard for me to judge what others are doing on their estimates it depends on the life a variety of factors so i cant even have sort of guess when it comes to commercial just because the portfolios are pretty different so i really honestly dont have an answer to you on that one jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and your next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question i think wed all agree that loan balance on january after the holidays would have a different repayment behavior than loan balance on may after tax refunds are distributed i realized from a cecl perspective youre supposed to take lifetime loss assumptions on both but im trying to understand how does the practical difference in terms of that nearterm repayment behavior impact your lifetime loss reserve and said slightly differently is growth in december the same as growth in june capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp rick i would just say that seasonal growth and transactors we look at those we look at the likelihood of revolving we use historical empirical data about how quickly those get paid down they dont tend to have large lifetime allowances and in general i would say those arent really a factor thats driving the multiples that weve disclosed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so as a followup to that we wouldnt necessarily expect to see that same seasonality because ph you were already able to factor in in the short term the repayment behaviors richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp yeah broadly speaking all else equal i think thats true jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and your next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes rich theres been a lot of talk in the banking and payments industry about b2b and capital one is a top three small business card issuer can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic there and what your thoughts are in terms of growth and is that growing faster than your consumer business richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp so the our small business business we dont break that out separately we are as we are in the consumer side one of the top players in the league table in that particular space ph mx is way north of the rest of us unlike the shorter distance between competitors on the consumer side but that business is a business that a simple transfer of a consumer approach or a lift and shift of a commercial approach ends up being a suboptimal thing and the traction and success weve gotten in the small business space comes from really working backwards from the customer and the customer needs over a very very long period of time and the so a lot of the underlying dynamics are the same in that business in terms of the shift in payments the reduction in cash and checks and so on but what i would leave you with is like our some of the other investments weve made at capital one this is many years kind of in the making and were continuing to generate successful growth there the one thing i would say is that on both the consumer side and certainly the small business and the commercial side the change that is going on in payments is breathtaking i think its really at the vortex of technology change in all of banking and thats partly because the digitization of transactions is a very natural place to go but its also one of the places that is not regulated or is very lightly regulated and furthermore it is the place where many tech capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 companies who really dont want to be carrying around bank holding company badges and things like that focus on how they can try to win on the frontend of banking and leave a lot of the backend of banking to the banks so im excited by the opportunity in on the business side as well as the consumer side but im certainly struck by the breathtaking rate of change and i think for every player in the business there is a real imperative to come up with a strategy and work backwards from where the world is going instead of forward from where we are jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp do you want to followup don donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc nope im all set jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator next question will come from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc afternoon thanks very much for taking my questions just not looking for guidance but just thinking conceptually long term it would seem logical that you could do more digital customer aggregation with the digital bank in place and with that is it fair to think that customer acquisition costs the costs tied to physical mailings and so forth may be more efficient going forward richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp wait i want to make sure john could you explain a little bit more of your question again john hecht q analyst jefferies llc its just you guys have invested a lot more to digital banking platform and its clear to us that as a user of your website you can do more online and so the question is given that your consumers can do more online are there crossselling opportunities are there other opportunities to reduce your customer acquisition costs for a specific product richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp yeah so from the interestingly from the founding notion of this company one of the founding notions was that marketing is going to be reinvented by the technology and information revolution and so way back with old fashioned direct mail we set out to build a business that we also didnt have a it was brought by being very small we didnt have much of a crosssell opportunity so much of the heritage of the company for a long period of time was focused on the origination of business capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 and one of the great prizes that awaited us over time was to have a scale franchise and there are two parts of that one is to really be large but the other is to be a franchise and if you overlay the whole digital revolution on that i want to redouble your point that i think the opportunity that awaits of the companies who have who bring three things to the table is extraordinary one is the table stake is you really need to be large and however important scale was in the past it is more important every day and i believe it was very important in the past the second thing that one needs to bring to the table is great digital capability and thats not just in terms of nice apps and that kind of thing but also the informationbased capabilities which increasingly are very benefited by realtime big data and the use of machine learning so theres a great opportunity there thats the second leg of the stool if you will but i really really what we believed at the outset and what we certainly live every day is theres a third leg of the stool and that is that you have to have a loyal customer franchise just having eyeballs lying around just having a large customer base its nice but the nonlinear things that happen when there is a deep and loyal franchise is a great thing if you look at the essence of capital ones strategy over all of these years we started with nothing and have spent years and years in the quest for scale secondly we have starting with an informationbased strategy many years ago and really and that was again preinternet and all of that but where weve come over time the whole tech transformation driving toward great digital capability and realtime machine learning big data capability and then finally and maybe of all of them this is the hardest one to build is really building that loyal customer franchise which is all about a great customer experience products that people can rely on a customer relationship that to tell your friends about and ultimately a brand that stands out and i appreciate your question because that has been three legs of the strategy for many many years and i think the growing traction that were having on a lot of fronts including on the financial side is a product of that opportunity and i think theres a lot more upside from here jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and your next question will come from brian hogan with william blair brian hogan q analyst william blair co llc good afternoon thanks first question is on the competition and your views on the apple card and if potential pressure could come from that largest competitor their growth has been pretty dramatic in the first year so and then a followup on that is actually potential competition from like the challenger banks like chime and varo n26 and others are you seeing any customer losses from those richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp right so brian your questions about competition are focused really more on the sort of the tech side and the new innovation as opposed to just the let me start with just a comment about competition in general in the card business and then let me pivot to some specific things capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 the credit card business i think has i think back to the founding of capital one i would say that capital one is a very young company compared to most of our bank competitors theyve been around for over years in capital ones case its not an accident that we started with credit cards because we had a belief way back then that credit cards structurally had a number of advantages that would allow them to have very good earnings power and also be absolutely at the tip of the spear of where the whole tech revolution and information revolution were taking it it is funny over years into this journey im finding a lot of the same observations that we had before and i think the credit card as a business is kind of standing out in these times relative to the earnings power of the business like this as well as some of the growth opportunities that it has that said that insights not lost on our competitors and this is a very competitive business but because of the scale requirements in the business and its a very consolidated business and i think most of the competition revolves around the top players in the business and i think the competition is intense but i think its fundamentally rational but the intent shows up in marketing intensity rewards offers pricing and various things but if we pull way up and i crosscalibrate to other parts of banking in which we play this feels like the area with the highest opportunity and the most kind of rational marketplace at the moment let me pivot to the tech marketplace often were asked by investors about fintechs and what about this startup and that startup and of course we keep an eye on that i think the sort of elephant in the room is the gigantic tech companies and the sort of opportunities that they have and so weve always had a lot of respect for that and frankly our tech transformation is motivated in many ways by trying to emulate and learn from some of the best practices of those companies it certainly has our attention when apple launches the apple card i think it was a really really welldone marketing campaign which is universally what weve observed from apple for many many years and well keep an eye on that but i would say that that now adds to the list of impressive competitors and impressive offerings that we are up against if we pivot to the challenger banks that are out there so im going to switch more to the deposit and banking side of the business theres some really striking numbers that have been posted by companies that are trying to establish themselves in banking we know from having spent a lot of years doing this and right now having a national banking strategy and you see us on television it is a really hard thing to dislodge business from the established banks with great scale and local presence and so that all of us are working very hard on that i have been struck by the numbers of account origination that are coming out of some of the challengers bank the biggest question i have and i dont know the answer its just a question i have is how much activity level and true sustaining traction do they have im not saying they dont i think its something that is an important place to look but were inspired by some of the innovation our competitors are doing and its a reminder to all of us that if we really lean into tech innovation theres an opportunity to chip away at the extraordinary position that a few of the biggest banks in the us have jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator and your final question in the evening will come from eric wasserstrom with ubs eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 okay thank you for fitting me in rich in your commentary you alluded to the fact that competition in the auto space intensified to some extent can you just give us a little more insight on what youre referring to and in what ways that manifested and then i have a one quick unrelated followup richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer president capital one financial corp yes so the auto business has a relatively small number of very large players and ive often said eric that competition in auto is even more impactful in the short term than competition in card only because on the auto side you have a dealer in the middle of an auction and when the dealer sees something from a particular lender like a looser credit policy or a different pricing the dealer can drive a significant amount of business in a way that just doesnt happen in the onetoone marketing that happens on the card side so its why almost every conversation that we have about auto and every time we celebrate a particular growth that we have we always caution how big that factor is and how much that factor can create adverse selection if people are loosening their credit policies so what we do is we invest heavily in technology in this business and were absolutely every quarter were out there to get whatever opportunity we can have consistent with our own standards and with a very very watchful eye on the competition in the last over the last few years there was a pullback of a couple of competitors that we took advantage of both of them have certainly returned and are pretty aggressive players in the space and what we would describe to you is that the competition is increasing in the auto space its nothing to waive red flags about but its generally increasing and the its a little bit unusual that at the same time were saying competition is increasing that were also saying we our originations and even our book of business overall are actually increasing that is something that may be a little bit anomalous there is also something hard for us to tease out is the growing traction that were getting by the very heavy investment we have in technology in the auto business thats in terms of underwriting realtime big datadriven underwriting the creation of products for customers and dealers in this space that are very sophisticated techdriven products that actually have realtime mass scoring of any car anywhere across the nation and the continued success that weve had in building deep dealer relationships so particularly kind of good quarter for capital one but i think the impression i would leave you with the competitive meter is rising and well have to keep an eye on that and the other very important thing that is probably the most important thing that we all should keep in mind in this business is that the auto business has been credit performance im speaking of the industry now has been benign for a long period of time and at the top of the list of why that is so is what has happened what is going on with used car prices which have then stayed at a relatively high level for a long period of time this is a collateraldriven business i also think when you have businesses where the collateral values have been high for a long period of time one has to we have to ask ourselves what collateral assumptions collateral value assumptions are underwriters making across the industry ill tell you what we do and we assume theyre going down i cant speak for the whole industry but i just want to put a caution that weve had good times for a long time in that business and collateral values have been an unusually strong ally and wont forever eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 thank you for that and my very quick followup scott is just on the tax rate it looked like it came in around inthisquarter percent or so how should was there anything special in this period some trueups or something and how should we think about the appropriate rate going forward richard scott blackley a chief financial officer headfinance and corporate development capital one financial corp yeah let me comment on more the fullyear tax rate because thats what i would point you to the fullyear tax rate was about i would say thats a reasonable baseline its going to be plus or minus from there depending on the income levels evolutions in our credit the businesses that generate tax credits but nothing particularly large we did have some discretes in the quarter which drove down the quarterly rate but is a good starting point for how you should think about the future jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp well thanks scott and thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call today thank you for your interest in capital one the investor relations
