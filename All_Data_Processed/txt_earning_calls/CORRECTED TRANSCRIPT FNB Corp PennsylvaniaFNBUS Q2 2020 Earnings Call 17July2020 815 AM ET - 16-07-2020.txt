second quarter results increased significantly operating earnings per share increased to which included an additional million or per share of covid19 reserve build in the quarter and ppnr fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 improved to million core revenue trends remained solid throughout a challenging interest rate environment with total revenues increasing annualized to million and total assets growing nearly billion to end june at billion compared to the first quarter loans and deposits increased billion and billion or and respectively on a linkedquarter basis doubledigit second quarter loan and deposit growth were supported by organic commercial production and originating nearly ppp loans totaling billion our feebased businesses performed exceptionally well with capital markets and mortgage banking establishing revenue records of million and million respectively our efficiency ratio was and operating expenses were well controlled down from the first quarter even though there has been disruption across our footprint due to covid19 weve still seen good commercial loan origination activity across most of the footprint this is a testament to our teams who continue to serve our clients and meet their borrowing needs while dealing with a challenging operating environment the strength in our balance sheet and ample liquidity enables fnb to support our clients capital needs we continue to apply our consistent underwriting standard aligned with our strategy and overall risk profile as we evaluate business opportunities in the current climate on a linkedquarter basis total average loans increased largely driven by growth in commercial loans of commercial line balances when compared to historical level contracted as we saw much lower line utilization of the utilization rate decreased as ppp funds were utilized to support working capital needs by many existing clients and economic activity declined during the period commercial loan balances were also impacted by large corporate borrowers paying down bank credit facilities with increased liquidity in the bond market average deposits increased as we had solid organic growth in customer relationships a large inflow of deposits for ppp funding and government stimulus activities also occurred as part of our business strategy we have been focused on reducing the level of wholesale borrowings by continuing to gain depositors and expand existing relationships as a result we were able to fully eliminate our overnight borrowing position replacing it with customer deposits noninterestbearing deposits were up billion or from prior quarterend looking at june spot balances our loantodeposit ratio was including the funded ppp loans which positions us more favorably in the current rate environment growing noninterestbearing deposits has been an integral part of our longterm strategy and weve consistently been able to grow organically through various interest rate environments further strengthening our overall funding mix in fact transaction deposits have increased billion or from march and now represent of total deposits which compares very favorably to five years ago with the fed taking nearterm rate increases off the table there is opportunity to offset net interest income headwind by continuing to reduce deposit costs as we have stated previously continuing to grow our feebased businesses is essential to diversifying our revenue sources and to mitigate pressure on net interest income in an extended lowrate environment with interest rate expectations now reflecting lower for longer it is important we continue to build on our recent success in capital markets mortgage banking wealth management and insurance fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 this quarters record mortgage banking income of million better reflects the fundamentals to the results without msr impairment as the mortgage banking business set a new production record for the quarter of million turning to our participation in the paycheck protection program i would first like to recognize our teams for their support of our customers and community throughout these extraordinary circumstances our employees have worked tirelessly to ensure businesses receive critical funding during a time when regions within our footprint experienced extended shutdown particularly in our metro markets in pennsylvania and the midatlantic and when many borrowers turned from larger banks to fnb to accommodate their needs as part of the ppp origination process each borrower opened an fnb account which supports our efforts to bring in new households looking ahead we are optimistic that borrowers will be able to deploy these funds as businesses around the footprint reopen as an organization we leveraged our technology infrastructure and expertise already in place to quickly adapt and accommodate our customers in a challenging remote environment coupled with significant financial aids and employee volunteerism in our communities our efforts have helped tens of thousands of small businesses during the pandemic and supported the retention of hundreds of thousands of jobs from the beginning of the covid19 crisis fnb has upheld consistent volumes of total transactions through other transactions by providing customers with a seamless transition from physical to online and mobile engagement this was made possible from the significant investment weve committed to our digital and online platforms over the last decade in fact the appointment setting feature on our new website that went live in january enabled fnb to continue serving clients safely in our branches throughout the crisis we grew from monthly appointments in january to appointments in april the rapid shift to remote services accelerated the enhancements to our digital strategy that were already underway and minimize disruption for our customers as the operating environment remains in a constant state of change we will continue our innovative approach to better serve our customers i will now share some updates regarding our

and integrated multichannel strategy customers have been more active in fnbs mobile and online channels with monthly average users up by in both categories compared to the average for while our customer adoption rates for online and mobile have accelerated our customers have still expressed a strong desire to conduct business within our branches as an essential business it is important for fnb to remain available and accessible our business continuity team in collaboration with other units including data science human resources and retail banking developed a fnb corp pennsylvania fnb

lobbies to customers adhering to the most stringent safety measures including social distancing and cleaning protocols as we begin to move forward to the next phase of operation with that ill turn the call over to gary to cover asset quality gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone during the second quarter our credit portfolio continued to perform in a satisfactory manner as the covid19 global pandemic continues to evolve our credit metrics have held ground in this challenging economic environment which i will cover with you in greater detail on both a gaap as well as a nongaap basis exclusive of our loan volume funded under the ppp program i will also provide some updates on the status of our loan deferrals and the steps we are taking to manage our book particularly those borrowers tied to covidsensitive industries lets now review the quarterly results the level of delinquency ended the second quarter at basis points on a gaap basis down bps over the prior quarter as earlystage delinquencies returns to more normalized levels when excluding ppp loan volume the level of delinquency would have ended the quarter at down bps from the prior quarter the level of npls and oreo totaled basis points at june an 8basispoint increase linkedquarter while the nongaap level was bps excluding ppp the migration was due primarily to a few previously rated credits that were further impacted by the current covid environment that we proactively moved to nonaccrual during the quarter of our total npls at june of these borrowers continued to pay as agreed and are current net chargeoffs remained at a good level at million for the quarter or basis points annualized resulting in a yeartodate level of basis points provision expense totaled million in the quarter which includes additional build for macroeconomic conditions prior to covid19 inclusive of the q1 economicdriven build our covidrelated provision for the first half of the year totaled million our ending reserve stands at and excluding ppp volume the nongaap ending acl totals representing a basis point increase over the prior quarter resulting in npl coverage of when including the acquired unamortized loan discounts our coverage excluding ppp volume is under the preliminary severely adverse dfast scenario the current reserve position inclusive of unamortized loan discounts would cover of stressed losses as the pandemic continues to pressure the global economy our approach to managing the book in this covid environment remains in line with what i communicated on last quarters call we continue to conduct thorough borrower level reviews within our commercial book to track key performance indicators for those that operate in economically sensitive industries where they have otherwise been impacted by the pandemic these ongoing targeted portfolio reviews allow our credit teams to quickly identify and proactively address emerging risks at the borrower industry or overall portfolio level additionally we continue to conduct a series of scenario analysis and stress test models under our existing allowance and dfast frameworks as we work through this challenging environment as it relates to our borrowers requesting payment deferral of our loan portfolio excluding ppp loans were approved during the initial deferment request window of these deferments were current and in good fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 standing prior to the pandemic of the remaining million million is already on nonaccrual a request for initial deferrals are essentially nonexistent and we have only seen a small amount of second request for payment deferral at this time that said we are carefully monitoring our credit portfolio and remain vigilant to identify borrowers that could face further pressure during uncertain economic conditions this approach allows us to quickly identify and manage risk in the portfolio while still meeting the credit needs of our customers the composition of the portfolio remains diverse and wellbalanced across several product lines geographies and industries as shown on slide our exposure to highly sensitive industries remains low at of the total portfolio which includes all borrowers operating in the travel and leisure food services and energy space and the level of payment deferrals granted to these borrowers remains at additionally we have been tracking our retail secured ire portfolio closely to assess the emerging challenges on this asset class as well as the nature of the tenants operations and insulation from certain economic strain as essential businesses our weighted average ltv position in this book remains strong at in summary we continue to manage our credit portfolio through this difficult economic environment by drawing on our strong credit fundamentals and our risk management strategies which we continue to enhance as the covid situation plays out considering these challenges our portfolio is in a satisfactory position entering the second half of the year realizing the uncertainty of the economic environment as we look ahead we continue to draw on the strength of our experienced banking teams to manage through this environment as we move into the latter half of the year i would like to recognize our teams for their tireless efforts as we continue to work through this challenging environment i will now turn the call over to vincent calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary good morning today i will review the secondquarter results and trends in our operating environment and then discuss our capital management approach and current position ill note that our tangible common equity levels entered the year at the strongest position weve had in nearly two decades and we are comfortable with our current capital position looking at slide gaap eps for the second quarter is including related to significant or outsized items these included million of covid19 reserve bill and million of covid19 related expenses the tce ratio ended june at reflecting these items as well as a 52basispoint temporary impact for the billion in net ppp loan balances at june without the ppp balances the tce ratio would have been additionally our cet1 estimate ended the quarter at compared to at march and at the end of as ppp loans carry a zero percent risk weighting for riskbased capital purposes pretax preprovision earnings increased to million providing more than adequate earnings power as we declared our third quarter dividend at  earlier this week with a dividend payout ratio of in the second quarter we are well below historical levels of previous payout ratios ill touch on our capital management approach in more detail later in my comments turning to the balance sheet on slide a key theme is the impact of billion in net ppp loan as high as of total loans and leases at june ppp was the primary driver in the linkedquarter average increase of billion or as well as strong organic activity across most of the commercial footprint fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 our commercial line utilization ended june at below historical levels down from the mid40s spot utilization rates at the end of the first quarter as we clearly saw some customer borrowing activity shift over to the ppp at our large corporate borrowers access to capital markets to reduce their bank debt average consumer loans were essentially flat with direct installment loans increased million or annualized and residential mortgage increased annualized two bright spots that continue to perform well the increases in direct installment and mortgage loans were offset by continued declines in direct auto loans and consumer lines two loan classes heavily affected by the pandemic continuing down to slide average deposit increased billion or on a late quarter basis led by billion or in transaction deposit growth transaction deposits equaled of total deposits as our managed decline in cds continued transaction deposit balance has benefited from stimulus programs and ppp customer driven inflows noninterest bearing interestbearing demand and savings account balances each increased significantly up billion million and million respectively now focusing on the income statement on slide compared to the first quarter net interest income totaled million a decrease of million or as loan and deposit growth mostly offset the impact from lower rates the net interest margin narrowed basis points to basis points primarily driven by a fullquarter impact to march action to lower the target set funds range to to basis points additionally average one month libor fell to basis points from basis points in the prior quarter total yield on average earning assets declined basis points to basis points reflecting lower yield on variable and adjustable rate loans due to the lower interest environment and the impact of the ppp balances total cost of funds decreased to basis points from basis points as costs and interestbearing deposits were reduced basis points slide and provide details for noninterest income and expense compared to the first quarter noninterest income totaled million increasing million or as mortgage banking operations increased million on a reported basis or million excluding msr impairments of and million respectively mortgage production established a new quarterly record at million increasing million or from the prior quarter with large contributions from north carolina and the midatlantic region capital markets also set a new record of million increasing million or with strong contributions from interest rate derivative activity across the footprint as expected service charges decreased million or due to noticeably lower transaction volumes in the covid19 environment turning to slide noninterest expense totaled million a decrease of million or including million of expenses associated with covid19 in the second quarter million of outsized unusual or significant expenses occurring in the first quarter on an operating basis expenses declined million or compared to the first quarter of as we have realized lower variable expenses such as travel and business development and increased fas benefits given the amount of loans originated in the second quarter additionally we recognized an impairment of million from a second quarter renewable energy investment tax credit transaction the related tax credits were recognized during the quarter as a benefit to income tax efficiency ratio improved significantly compared to fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 referring to recent trends on slide we continue to observe daily changes in external factors including multiple aspects of potential economic recovery changes in government programs and regulation changes over current programs saying that we are providing our current directional outlook for the third quarter based on what we know today which is subject to change as we all know we expect periodend loans to increase lowsingledigits from june assuming no forgiveness of ppp loans given the sbas current expected time for processing forgiveness applications while we expect deposits to decline from second quarter levels based on an expectation that customers increase the deployment of funds received through the government programs we do expect to see continued organic growth in transaction deposits we expect third quarter net interest income to reflect the full impact of lower onemonth libor rates and variable rate loans partially offset by a full quarter benefit of higher commercial loan balances continued reductions in the cost of interestbearing deposits we expect positive trends in capital markets and mortgage banking although lower than the record levels this quarter we expect service charges to increase if recent transaction volume trends continue we expect expenses to be stable up slightly from the second quarter lastly we expect the effective tax rate to be around for the fullyear for the remainder of my comments i would like to discuss our riskbased capital position and overall management philosophy given the current environment beginning on slide continue to be very comfortable with our capital ratios as they stand today with the benefit of entering this crisis from a position of strength as demonstrated in the new capital slides we have added to the deck we have ample internal capital generation cushions for all of our capital ratios in relation to wellcapitalized thresholds for example for the total riskbased capital ratio to fall below total capital would have to drop by million of total capital of billion our riskweighted assets would have to increase by billion which is of total riskweighted assets of billion i could comment also that million is in aftertax dollars on top of our capital position we have a conservative bias in how we build reserves especially given the consistent underwriting philosophy has been in place for well over a decade with cet1 of billion and an allowance for credit losses of million and a remaining pcd discount of million we have a substantial base available to absorb credit losses put that in context our reserves plus remaining discount on previously acquired loans would cover quarters of net chargeoffs that averaged million per quarter in the first half this is before considering the billion in cet1 another way to look at this is relative to severely adverse chargeoffs in our last stress test again using million in reserves plus remaining discount we covered of million in chargeoffs projected under the severely adverse scenario for a ninequarter period when you put the million in context that compares to million over nine quarters using the first half of net chargeoffs or times the current levels as far as dividend sustainability we are governed by the federal reserve and occ from a fed perspective we currently pay out million in common dividends and million in deferred dividend for a total of million per quarter the fed fourquarter test currently shows an excess of million after paying out the third quarter dividend just declared from an occ perspective there are significant cushions to support the million the bank is projected to pay up to the holding company threepart test shows a cushion of million relative to undivided profit fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 million relative to net profits for the current year combined with retained net profits for the first two years cushions are both wellcapitalized levels ranging from basis points to basis points in addition to looking at our capital position its important to consider ppnr generation yeartodate ppnr of million more than supports the incremental reserve bill to the first six months of the year we generated ample capital to cover the preferred and common dividend and our cet1 ratio was consistent with where we ended at earlier this week we announced our third quarter dividend of given the earnings level through the first half of you can see there is capacity to continue to return capital to shareholders overall our capital management philosophy is grounded in a conservative and consistent underwriting and credit management philosophy throughout varying economic cycles supplemented with robust and comprehensive enterprise risk management including very active credit monitoring processes with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince looking at everything weve managed through over the last few months the efforts of our team has been nothing short of exceptional with assisting our clients and communities in which we serve recent events highlighting persistent inequities in our country have affirmed our important mandate to support those who are vulnerable and traditionally underserved as an organization we continue to place a strong emphasis on being inclusive and demonstrated by our recent million commitment to address economic and social inequity in low and moderate income and predominantly minority community as we continue to deploy these investments our shareholders will benefit as we have continued to prudently manage risk liquidity and capital action to better position our company during the quarter fnb originated nearly million in paycheck protection program loans in low to moderate income and rural neighborhoods assisting thousands of small businesses and employees our success is a direct result of our bankers proactive outreach to over organizations and nonprofit entities that work directly with these communities this is just an example of how committing our resources this way leads to good business results i encourage everyone to learn more about our ongoing initiatives and commitment to diversity and inclusion through the links contained on the slides within todays presentation as we look ahead to move into the next phase of covid19 recovery we will continue to focus our response on four key pillars to meet the needs of each of our constituents the pillars are employee protection and assistance operational response and preparedness customer and community support and risk management and actions taken to preserve shareholder value given the extreme challenges presented through these unprecedented conditions our employees have consistently delivered a superior experience for our customers in june fnb was ranked among the best banks in ohio and north carolina by forbes and advisoryhq respectively a testament to the consistency of our customercentric culture across our footprint the company was again named the top workplace in northeastern ohio for the sixth consecutive year by the cleveland plain dealer this recognition which is based solely on employee feedback joins the list of nearly 30such awards received over the past decade all of this has been made possible by our dedicated employees in closing i would again like to thank my fellow team members as they have demonstrated throughout this time exactly why they continue to be our most valuable assets our dedication to cultivating superior culture directly fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 translates into a better customer experience greater financial performance and higher returns for our shareholders with that i will turn the call over to the operator to open the call for questions question and answer section operator yes thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question comes from casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys ill start with a housekeeping question and ive gotten this a lot the so the purchase accounting vince in the quarter and the outlook going forward vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well the accretion was million of the kind of remaining discount from cecl approach there and you may remember that was million in the first quarter so down a little bit but still a pretty good healthy level there casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then gary on the credit quality front so the deferrals at sounds like the new requests have dramatically slowed i believe you guys were on a threemonth program so i mean they should be either extending or going back to normal you know what is sort of based on your indications and discussions you know what how do you expect that to that to trend in the next quarter this quarter gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey casey in reference to that we did do days and it really got active in mid to lateapril into may june flattened out significantly there was very small numbers of activity in june so what we did we had a significant number of our clients made the april payment march was already made they made the april payment and we kind of shoved them further into the recovery so at this point weve only seen about commercial requests for second deferrals and about on the retail side so at this point its been very light and the bankers are working closely with those top clients and talking with them on a regular basis we do expect that to ramp up as we work through the rest of july and into august and september a bit but at this point its very light casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and so do you expect those deferrals to stay at when you guys report in october or do you expect a lot of them to go back to normal fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we expect a lot of those deferrals to go back to normal payments and well report that going forward as a lot of those clients are not going to need a second deferral its going to be a significant number that were not needed from our perspective at this point casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think what you will see you will see heavier deferrals for second requests coming in the hotel space and in that restaurant space as they have more pressure the other item that ill mention to you again is coming into the situation using the end of the year of these clients who took the deferrals were in perfectly good standing so it was a very small number as mentioned in my report that werent working in the normal course of business naturally this shutdown has impacted a lot of clients and a lot of clients were preserving liquidity and being cautious but hopefully that answers the question for you holistically casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yes yes thank you and so on the reserve build you guys had moderated this quarter just when did you what forecast how late is the how recent is the forecast that you used to build your reserve and do you guys given that the reserve build moderated this quarter do you feel like youve and the deferrals youre getting decent news there do you feel like the reserve builds the heavy lifting has been done or the i know its a tough question to answer it changes every day but just given where deferrals are going and your lower reserve build it feels like you guys are the heavy lifting is behind so just some color there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah on the model first let me address that one for you first i mean we continue to use a recessionary scenario casey released in midjune with the average unemployment rate of over the forecast horizon with annualized yearoveryear gdp not turning positive until the middle half of so its a fairly good recessionary scenario that weve used in the model as it relates to the second part of your question with our focus and consistent view on our underwriting and our credit culture around the desired asset classes that we want put into book and the position and mix of our portfolio i feel pretty confident that our book will generally outperform through the cycle as it did in the last that said there is a significant amount of uncertainty as youve mentioned in the economy at this point in the economy if the economy deteriorates further from here the portfolio would experience higher levels of stress given our position and the performance todate our portfolio mix the smaller portfolios across higher asset classes well continue to assess the positions around it as the third quarter plays out few additional comments here remember in q1 we captured the march forecast when others may not have so we utilized that most recent bit of information around our forecasted models at that point and during that first half we built totally million now through the first six months fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 also of note we really essentially have no credit card student loan and a very small energy portfolio those are tough from the reserve standpoint during this environment as you all know in addition we had a pretty significant decline in line utilization indirect auto and some declines in the small business portfolio which really freed up about million in additional reserves during the quarter for us so that helped as well and finally when youre look at the of the macroeconomic environment and looking at it from a static position moving forward similar performance across our portfolio we wouldnt expect much of any additional build from a macroeconomic forecast perspective and well continue to manage that accordingly based on how the economy evolves from here casey haire q analyst jefferies llc excellent thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would just add if you look at and i think we commented on this but the reserve coverage excluding the ppp was million we have million of remaining discount on the acquired loans thats left in the cecl accounting so if you thats available to absorb losses so the million goes to million and then as we had in our slide we had another million in reserve for unfunded volumes which is another basis points or so so theres a good amount that weve added to the reserves since the end of the year garys point casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood and vince say just last one for me the total capital ratio i didnt see it in the release of the deck it was just what was it at vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania total riskbased capital ratio casey haire q analyst jefferies llc correct vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania we did not we did not disclose that yet casey were we have the cet1 at after i get that be able to get that by the end of the fall i just dont have that handy casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from frank schiraldi with piper fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just on the a followup on credit as you guys point out if you look at the reserve ratio with the including the acquired book it seems to hold up well versus where peers are but if i drill down into categories at first glance it seems to be a bit a little bit thinner in some areas than i would have expected so i just wonder if you could give maybe a little bit more detail or color around for example the retail cre book where i think reserves are still just under gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah when you look at that portfolio frank we have displayed very few problem credits in that book we feel very good about our sponsors across that portfolio and weve really focused our underwriting in that book at higher cash flow streams and required debt service coverage over the last few years due to the fact that some of it is retail focused as weve thought one of the things that we have in there is an extremely low level of delinquency today naturally the situation is fluid but the delinquency in that book is basis points with very low levels of any rated credit at this point so that book has been very nicely underwritten from our perspective and as mentioned in my earlier comments the ltvs across that are right at so were wellpositioned in that portfolio at this point so really feel good about it and working with those clients whats happening at this point we are seeing rental streams start to increase as the economy has opened up well continue to keep an eye on that and as we move forward but hopefully well continue to see positive momentum there as we are frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies and how are you guys approaching downgrades are deferrals pushing downgrades of credits to classified credit size are the deferrals pushing that down the road or are you taking them as they come and just wondering if you feel like there could be as these deferrals come off a migration there that could drive further reserve builds gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah during the first round the credits that were in sensitive industries were generally moved a notch other credits that were in a very strong position and were being conservative those particular ones werent moved during the second phase here every second deferral will require a onenotch downgrade if not two in most instances to a substandard rating so well continue to work that portfolio in that fashion and address those ratings accordingly based on the risk present in each one of those credit situations fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania frank i will tell you in the commercial portfolio ill speak to the commercial portfolio here im not sure if youre crossing over to consumer but theres very active management risk rating reviews that go on perpetually so there is a very aggressive management system in place to ensure that as we review financials and review credit company compliance that the appropriate risk rating is assigned to those credits so the migration on risk rating if thats what youre asking is going on now i mean its been going on when these deferrals come in it may have been a little early right because the majority of the impact for our commercial customers based upon what im hearing was happening in april late march into april and may and then theyve kind of rebounded back most of the industries have come back well beyond where they were at the depths of april so thats an ongoing process and we have a fairly rigorous process in place to review mis readings gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vinces point there frank is a very good point i mean were known from a regulatory standpoint to be very aggressive from a risk grading touch standpoint every our focus is that every time a banker touches a credit no matter what it is whether its annual review time whether its line of credit renewal time or whether its a phone call we require them to assess the situation and downgrade risk on a monthtomonth basis so that proactive approach i think has been in place for many years frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies great thanks and then just a quick one on expenses if i could you guys gave some guide for what to expect in the third quarter do you is there you know if you could just give us a little bit of the puts and takes in terms of getting there from this quarter i know you had the tax credit would have increased expenses this quarter so just trying to get a sense of if i look at if i take out the covidrelated expense i guess im at like i guess at million for the expense base in the quarter so is that kind of where youre talking off of in terms of steady to slightly up number and is that a good run rate maybe beyond if you can give us any sense there thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure yeah on the slide we mentioned that we had the million impairment and then going the other way because you didnt see much movement in that other noninterest expense line item you know we had lower business development we have oreos reported to oreo a lower miscellaneous losses and miscellaneous so they kind of net out as you can see it was in the first quarter and in the second quarter so when you look forward to the third quarter i mean the comments that i made in my prepared remarks kind of the mid id say kind of somewhere between million 177ish or so theres that includes commissions on mortgage activity which has been very heavy so that comes through to that line item and youll see some of that come through in the third quarter so i mean its really right around you know i think last quarter i used like a million i think wed be south to that we came in at the million kind of on a total basis million like you said so its somewhere around there frank you know million to million i kind of use as a run rate for the third quarter and in the fourth quarter were not really giving any other direction there but theres nothing unusual on the horizon that would hit that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay great thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay operator thank you and the next question comes from michael young with suntrust michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning michael michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc a quick followup question to start just on credit you know on slide you guys present kind of your historical chargeoff peak rate going back to the last crisis which you obviously performed well through exflorida is that kind of the right way to think about chargeoffs this time around gary do you feel comfortable with that or do you think that given kind of the severity and the shock that and potential length of this crisis that could be worse this time around gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania you know i feel similarly confident michael around how the portfolio will perform through a cycle such as this you know when you look at our models as we mentioned in terms of the stress testing that were doing and all of the models that were running across the portfolio and the build of million during the first six months of the year if you would add that to normalized chargeoffs youre looking at chargeoffs on an annualized basis in the 45basispoint range or so at that stress level and the models are confirming that it feels to me quite good naturally the economy has to stabilize at some point the volatility needs to move away but at this point it feels good from that perspective michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay so just to kind of put everything together i mean if we took a chargeoff rate similar to that and then assumed kind of the macro conditions have maybe stabilized in terms of the cecl allowance outlook then you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 would just be kind of accounting for downgrades and those chargeoffs that we kind of already mentioned and thats kind of how we should think about credit and provisioning going forward gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say thats appropriate vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and providing for growth gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania right for growth michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc sure yeah were hoping for that i think vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania were hoping for growth michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah and then maybe switching gears vince just on the ppp loans and the fees associated with those was there any recognition of those fees on an accelerated amortization basis this quarter and then what is your outlook for that on a goforward basis vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no i would say the forgiveness process hasnt started yet the sba is still working on how theyre going to receive forgiveness applications so kind of were ready for that once it comes but its not theyre not ready to be able to start that process yet so the fee recognition that came in will be just kind of a normal accretion of the fees over the the vast majority of the loans are the twoyear terms we had a handful with the five years so i guess the one way to look at it is just the yields for the second quarter was which is the coupon plus the accretion of a portion of the fees so we dont have any acceleration thats coming in there yet and you really dont know its hard to predict i mean in our heads weve been ticking around maybe you get forgiveness in q4 you probably wont get any in the third quarter just because of theyre not ready yet so and then they have days to respond and it pushes it out into the fourth quarter so i guess for like modeling purposes weve been using as an assumption in q4 and then maybe you get threequarters of it by the end of march and then maybe by the end of june and then you have some tail and those are just reference points like well nobody really knows but we do expect to get some level of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 forgiveness that will happen in the fourth quarter and then depending on the magnitude that pulls some of the fees forward so those are kind of the key points there as far as the ppp balances and in the third quarter i should just comment too so the average balance was billion the average balance in the third quarter will be kind of billion net is what well have because we didnt have all of it throughout the second quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the other thing ill say this is vince delie ill put a pitchin for our it folks and sam kirsch in digital channels weve built out a fairly robust system for clients to upload the information to walk that walks them through the forgiveness process which keeps changing and is fairly sophisticated but a very nice process and then gary guerrieri hired a team of people and has assembled a team that will focus on acting as liaisons for clients to help facilitate the forgiveness process so were still hoping for an easier process on those smaller loans that i know is being kicked around for instantaneous forgiveness for million to million that would help tremendously but we have systems in place to help facilitate forgiveness for our clients the only other thing ill point out is when you look at the balances our loan balances overall were if you subtract it out the ppp loans would be down slightly it was at i think overall you know its kind of a hard equation to do because we have smaller clients if you look at the dispersion of deployment of those ppp loans the relative size of our loans are smaller typically those customers would borrow through the ppp program pay down the working capital facilities right because the great deferential is fairly significant and then borrow back on their lines when if they have confidence that theyre going to be able to do that so i think its when you look at the transfer from ppp to our own revolver balances or line balances of small business customers that explains some of the decline in the portfolio the overall activity across the company as i mentioned in my prepared comments was pretty good and there are still financeable enterprises out there there are entities that we would certainly consider providing credit too in other industries that are distressed and we dont play significantly as you can see from the breakdown of the portfolio that weve provided in our disclosures were not very active in a number of those areas so im a little more optimistic about the activity moving forward of course we havent seen the fallout yet that will happen i think from a credit perspective in the third and fourth quarter but so far it looks okay for us anyway i thought id share that with you some additional commentary michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah thanks thanks for that additional color vince and then just maybe last one for me just on the net interest margin it looks like you guys still have some room to bring down the deposit and funding costs from here could you maybe just talk about the timing and opportunity with that and then if theres any kind of lingering roll down in loan yields from this point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well on the liability side i mean i think if theres opportunity within the deposit base i know weve had significant deposit growth even outside of the ppp the growth related to ppp balances coming on our demand deposits were up significantly and were trending up over the last few years so that has continued i think there fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 are opportunities there to bring down our overall costs and ill let vince talk about the asset side of the equation in terms of margins but on the liability side there is room for us to continue to improve on that side vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you just a couple of comments so when you look at performance for the quarter so net interest income declined million given that we had a 105basispoint reduction in onemonth libor and ph basis points thats a 22million reduction in interest income an billion if you look at the net decline given that million its not a bad outcome there and then as i mentioned in the beginning of the call indiscernible accretion coming in a little bit lower from ph to will have some impacts just comparing the second quarter to the first quarter when you look at the we had billion growth in average earning assets largely funded with billion noninterestbearing deposits and as vince said thats been a continuous growth obviously it has additional influx from the program but weve been growing ddas every year so when you look at the cost of the interestingbearing deposits as we had on the slide we were able to bring that down basis points to help mitigate the impact on the libor so were able to offset a good chunk of that which is a positive if you look at the kind of entry point into the third quarter on a spot basis the cost of interestbearing deposits is basis points the average for the quarter was basis points so you have an 11basispoint kind of head start going into the third quarter and theres still buckets of deposits that were weve targeted and were looking at and continuing to expect to bring those rates down some more so theres definitely some more impact there i think as far as the asset side of it i mean libor is at basis points so it was down to basis points its up a couple well take a couple of basis points but i dont think theres anything unusual that will come through kind of third quarter versus the second quarter just other than mix the mix of the loans that you put on so thats been really kind of beyond that and the spreads have kind of been stable in the recent months michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks michael operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys its jared here gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc morning so just a question i guess on the reserve build so that million of incremental build from the macro forecast gary is that just taking the model with the macro assumptions that you laid out and thats whats flowing through or were there some qualitative overlays some of those other items that you discussed that that offset what the model would otherwise have spit out for the macroeconomic expectation for the reserve gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no it would include some overlays around our normal modeling process jared so yeah it is inclusive of overlays and qualitatives jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess if we see the macro model deteriorate in the third quarter should we assume that theres potentially some additional overlays that would offset just the pure impact of that move or not necessarily gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no its going to remain fluid i mean i cant speculate on what the situations now with the forward view is going to be at that point you know based on where we are today we feel good about the position of the portfolio well continue to keep an eye on it and manage it as the macroeconomic environment changes going forward jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay vince d earlier in your commentary you had mentioned something about evaluating business opportunities and as you go forward can you give a little color on what that could look like vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean we there are certain areas for example we just booked a fairly large credit in the believe it or not its a developer that has tenants occupied 25milliondollar deal that an insurance company was looking to get out of retail exposure the loantovalue is the debt service covered is times or greater so there are transactions out there that you would do the tenant base is largely large investmentgrade banks theres four banks in our parcel on the property so there are and theres a grocery store thats very solid long term lease i mean these are long term leases there are opportunities to do business i mean were just going to have to be extraordinarily selective on what we go after we also recently won a large credit facility for a aarated higher education institution so theres still activity going on with billions of dollars in reserves so were just going to have to watch what we do and i know that our folks are very in tune with the appropriate opportunities to go after you know we have the capital and liquidity to continue to move forward and the conservative nature of our underwriting puts us in a position today to continue operating and weve said that all along thats our business model were not as flashing during the expansion periods but pretty solid during the downturn and i think that creates stability for lending from our perspective and continuous business activities so ill tell you our employees not fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 the you know i made prepared comments but these people have worked countless hours doing the ppp program managing the credit risk i could go on and on and on i mean im so impressed with what theyve been able to do and our pipeline if you look at our production over the last quarter you know our production was pretty comparable to the previous quarter the postcovid quarter that we were comparing to so again theyre not just sitting at home which is what i was afraid was going to happen theyre working very hard and my hats off to our employees who are passionate about their customers they care and theyre very eager to make sure we get through this and get through it soundly there is a lot of activity jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc but so as we as we look forward though thats the type of stuff we should be assuming not not think ma is that correct vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania at this point i dont weve said the last three years were not focused on i dont think this would be the appropriate time to focus on it we need to ride the ship here from an economic perspective as a country and we need to get a better feeling for whats going to happen theres a lot of uncertainty as we move forward but the one thing im certain about is the quality of the people that we have and our ability to manage through it weve proven it before during this is the same management team through the last crisis and many of the bankers are the same so i feel very confident that were going to get through this and well be in a great position to decide what we want to do on the other end of it maybe ma after were through this is a distinct possibility for us given the strength of the company so i well play that card down the road i think as we sit today the other thing i will mention jared is we opened our ppp program up to nonclients in our newer markets because we felt that some of the larger institutions were incapable of delivering and in the first round of ppp our people originated billion we were able to convert and fund of the applications that we brought in most of the large banks were in the low or range so we brought over a lot of clients or prospects that are now clients that will lead to future opportunities for our bankers because theyre now part of the capital structure of these companies so im optimistic once we get through this about that as well theres at least middle market prospects that we now have a relationship with so well see how that all plays out down the road but very good execution by our employees and thats why were where we are jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from russell gunther with d a davidson fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co just a followup on the deferral conversation earlier so i understand your kind of holistic view on this exposure so the thats current and in good standing coming into the pandemic but do you guys consider these customers to be higher risk given that they are in a forbearance program currently and if so is that accounted for in the current reserve gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania the answer is yes i mean those or many of those customers russell with the onset of the pandemic and the shock to the economy and the shock to everyone in the business community a significant number of them were wanting to be cautious some of them drew their lines up our line draws went up to about they wanted to grab liquidity they looked for deferrals 75plus of our commercial deferrals decided to pay the interest not take interest deferrals so they paid the interest at their own volition the more compromised industries took pi deferrals as weve talked about the books are relatively small hotels and restaurants have been severely impacted i would expect those clients in those industries to be taking second deferral opportunities due to the volatility in opening reopening closing down and what does the future look like that all being said the deferrals in the restaurant business has been remarkably low at i think its about that has been quite surprising to us that its not been higher so the risk ratings have been dealt with the risk ratings continued to be dealt with second requests will cause additional further downgrades and we feel that we have the appropriate risk classifications across the credits in the portfolio at this point russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co i appreciate that gary and then apologies if i missed it but did you guys disclosed where criticized and classified assets are this quarter im not sure i saw it in the release gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania we did not but that should be in the q im sure russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co just directionally can you just touch on whether there is a significant fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 indiscernible russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co migration gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania theyre up moderately russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks gary and then from a timing perspective on chargeoffs whatever the magnitude obviously a lot of unknowns of stimulus and forbearance but i guess just your assumptions around timing in terms of when we could see chargeoffs begin to start going up from youve still had a very solid first half of the year gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would tell you russell that youre going to see that impact in q4 and into you may see a little impact late in q3 but i would tell you q4 and into would be my view russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks gary and then last one for me guys youve provided some broad strokes on the ppnr guide for the third quarter and tightened up the expense range for us so appreciate that but trying to tie it all together do you think you can maintain this level of ppnr qq based on the puts and takes of that ppnr guide vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think we give you all the drivers russell right so i think kind of given you the moving parts there i think if you go through some of the elements if you think about net interest income for instance right were going to have one month libor today is at basis points so it averaged basis points in the second quarter so if you bring that down into billion to billion its about million a quarter of net interest income just from the libor adjusted there okay and then you have the purchase accounting i mentioned was million i would still expect it to be strong in the third quarter probably a little bit lower than that but its still kind of a good level i will expect it to still kind of be in the double digits at least so thats an element to net interest income and then the ppp loans youll have the full billion those are added to net interest income and added it to margin the longer theyre funded with tbas so and as i mentioned earlier were going to continue to work down the cost of the interestbearing deposits so that clearly will have a positive impact so but kind of netnet net interest income i would expect to be down a little bit the fee income should still be at a very strong level the guidance as i mentioned there we would expect the service charges to bounce back up i mean they were running in the kind of to yearoveryear declines of the transaction volumes and thats running more in the to so i would expect to see kind of that element of noninterest income to increase some i mean mortgage at million million is a record high i wouldnt expect that to be as fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 strong as that but i would expect that to still kind of be in the double digits for sure and well see theres a lot of pipelines high theres lot of activity continuing to go on and this is a busy time for that business and then the capital markets piece that number set a couple of new records in a row i would expect that to be very strong again in the third quarter i cant predict another record but i expect it to be very strong kind of relative to whats in there and then some of the other key businesses that were down the wealth and insurance businesses i would expect those to kind of bounce back up so noninterest income in total kind of will reflect all those drivers so again theres a lot moving parts and the service charges well see how that plays out the recent movement increase in the transaction still down but its not down as much and it will be helpful and then the expense side as you know we manage expenses very closely as a company and we always do and the expenses have been if you look at it kind of on an operating core basis theyve been very very flat so i think that that will help overall so i mean where the ppnr ends up netnet i mean well see i would still expect it to be very strong i think when you look at where it was for the first six months million on a yeartodate basis i mean ill expect it to still be very strong again in the third quarter so and im not giving you a number but trying to give you guys all the different drivers and kind of understand what were seeing and just what the outlook is from where we sit today russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co no very helpful vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i want to go back to caseys question earlier so the total riskbased capital estimate would be about i think last quarter theres a slide in here i think it was it was at the end of the year at the end of march so the estimate is for where we would be at the end of june gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania and we did have tangible book value per share growth vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania bv growth in the quarter russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co so vince thank you guys for all the color on taking the ppnr question and for answering all my questions thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell operator thank you and the next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its a long call so i have to be quick so just starting quickly on vince calabrese just a question on the ppp impact so in terms of the interest income contribution in related to ppp i think calculate maybe roughly million can you just verify that and then also related to ppp whats the opex benefit was youve sort of alluded to it but from the deferred loan origination costs from ppp loans also in the second quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure the billion the total interest income on that for the quarter was basically million for the quarter so yields will get to if you use those two pieces of billion and then well have like i said the billion average we would have since indiscernible forgiveness yet in the third quarter so and that includes accretion of the portion of the fees that i mentioned earlier and then the fas deferred origination cost went up by million from the first quarter to the second quarter which is just driven by the ppp is obviously the biggest driver of that so that benefit helps on the expense side and then that kind of comes in that your accretion comes in net of that thats the yield adjustment over the remaining life as well as the fees but obviously theres a net positive indiscernible fees minus the cost so that was the delta for the quarter of million collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful and then just lastly gary great color on some of the credit moves especially with the retail cre just curious if you could give us a little bit maybe similar credit metrics within the hotel book i mean its a small percent of the overall book i get it or whatever but just looking at the reserve on that the just kind of where you have comfort like what about that book gives you comfort that thats the right reserve level fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of that portfolio collyn when you look at the performance of it a significant chunk of that portfolio in excess of million or probably about 40pluspercent of it is what i would call our few core customers in that space we have never been a hotel lender other than some very strong wellheeled longtenured hotel professionals who have built up significant capital so theres a good chunk of that business that is very very sound the majority of the rest of it came from acquisitions youll recall that the portfolio got up in excess of million to million postacquisition we have run it down to million we have not lent into the space for over four years at this point delinquency on that book and naturally some of the weaker smaller hotels when i say that im talking about small momandpop shops which weve got through some acquisitions were helped surely by the government stimulus and the deferral programs but delinquency is at basis points and weve really derisked that portfolio over the last few years as i mentioned is it going to withstand some losses absolutely we understand that and well work through what we can with our clients and youll probably have some increases in nonaccrual assets in that book as well i would surely expect as we move forward but generally speaking i feel good about the position of it weve moved higher risk assets off the books and well have to deal with some hopefully that helps give you some color there collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats very helpful okay thats all i had thanks everyone thanks collyn gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys thanks for sticking around so long to answer all the questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc sort of a quick question could you remind me why the million pcd discount isnt part of the reserve post cecl fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania with the discount on the loan portfolios so when you go through the cecl accounting and you gross up the acquired loans into the loan balance its just a discount that gets accreted in i mean thats just the way the accounting rules work its basically works marks that we have left on the acquired loans prior to cecl vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania in pools vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in pools you had basically retained gains or remaining marks that were left there because you couldnt bring that into income until the pool is gone or very close to gone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania this is stranded capital vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania stranded there right brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay all right thanks for that the reserve ratio exppp the cecl is supposed to be for expected lifetime losses so just want to know if you could give us a sense for what that sort of implies within your modeling for i guess nearterm peak npas gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania in terms of peak npas brody im not going to sit here and speculate on that thats a difficult thing to do theres so much volatility in the environment when you look at where is this thing going i dont think any of us really know when you look at the economy today and where its going i would tell you that youre going to see increases in npas as we work through this situation across the industry as far as giving throwing out a peak number i dont feel comfortable doing that brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay all right and then i guess maybe switching gears to ppp just given the cost of servicing the ppp loans and some of the i guess the longer time line of working through forgiveness have you all considered selling these loans to a thirdparty like weve seen some smaller banks do vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 yeah i mean weve received calls on that and the people who want to buy it want to kind of get the all the income for free so it really doesnt work i mean weve looked at it for us we think its better to keep it on the balance sheet just given the price points that people are talking about gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania the hardest part was originating it vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania so once you originate it i think you have it its going to lead to for us first of all it was beneficial to our clients so and theyre very appreciative of it it helps build loyalty i think for us to sell it at this point would not go over well and again we were able to build out an automated process that made it very efficient we were one of the few banks that had an endtoend digital process we introduced bankers along the way we had thousands bankers interacted with clients but they had a fully digitized process paperless process to bring them on so the same is going to happen with forgiveness for us we invested pretty heavily internally in the resources to be able to do that thats a differentiator for our company and were going to have a very slick system thats online that permits forgiveness watch the client through step by step on forgiveness it enables them to upload documents digitally an so were able to do it a little more efficiently a smaller bank might struggle theyve had to outsource probably a portion to that or maybe all of it so at that point they may be looking to get out from under the burden of processing those forms considering in most cases smaller banks it was a larger percentage of their total assets for us its the substantial portfolio but we can manage it with the resources that we have plus mentioned the thousands of noncustomers that we were had relationships with our bankers have been calling on they called in and said hey i cant get my ppp loans through my large bank would you be willing to do it for us we accommodated those requests i will say something else too that i didnt mention i mention in my prepared comments our folks reached out to community groups and nonprofits in low to moderate income communities across our footprint it was before it became an issue and we were able to originate billion in ppp loans in those low to moderate income and rural communities where the job retention is critically important so were very proud of what we did and i think weve done a masterful job of underwriting them of ensuring that we have good quality borrowers on the other end and were going to carry that through brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 thats our philosophy overall philosophy on it brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right and then on the just going back to the margin liquidity you had a pretty significant increase in cash million or so i just wanted to understand how much of that was driven by ppp if any and sort of what you expect for cash balances moving forward vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the influx of the deposits that we had which exceeds the loans and loantodeposit ratio coming down to kind of captures all of that as vince mentioned in his remarks we went from having overnight borrowings to investing the few hundred millions that you mentioned in there which really isnt that big on our balance sheet and kind of as we sit here today thats and above zero so as deposits at some point will get utilized that number will kind of flux up and down as that happens and then in the meantime ppp is such a big driver to the numbers we continue to add new relationships and new accounts and gaining some business and to vinces point of the ppp customers were prospects so were noncustomers so thats a pool of clients that were going to be actively vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and they opened depository relationships with the bank because they needed to fund the loan some of them chose to move additional deposits over or expand the relationship so when you look at we actually tracked the ppp fundings we have a system that we put in place its not accurate but we developed when we were originating to watch flows of funds migration of funds and what weve seen is an expansion in the number of accounts that we have with that pool of customers so the deposit balances in certain instances exceed the amount of ppp loan that was funded thats helped us i mean if you look at the deposits overall were up over well over the amount of ppp balances and some of those balances went and moved over to pay down existing debt so were looking pretty good from a deposit perspective i mean i feel pretty good about our funding base and our ability to gain households vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and our teams are working to expand those relationships to vinces point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and thats in the midst of the pandemic so i think social civil unrest i think our like i said our people have done a tremendous job i couldnt be prouder brody preston q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 all right great thats it for me everyone thank you for the time this morning and thanks for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you appreciate it operator thank you and the next question comes from william wallace with raymond james william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc hey guys ill try to be quick one quick modeling question on the ppp based on the way the rules are written today what is your expectation of the percent of loans that will be forgiven vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think in total i would think that the vast majority of that will be forgiven i mean its got to be in the i mean we dont know with certainty vince mentioned the were talking about an automatic forgiveness for loans below im not sure if thats going to happen or not but that clears out i mean our average i think was indiscernible gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania the average is vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so i also think multiple speakers vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we did a pretty good job will when you brought clients in there was an opportunity to walk them through what would be required for forgiveness and i think our folks based upon what we required there was a certification by the lender that we required that they validated certain pieces of information and had discussion thats why we had reactivated bankers across multiple lines of business to interact with the clients that will helping in the forgiveness process that will help us achieve a higher percentage of forgiveness fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then will just to restate what i said earlier i mean our assumption right now or our estimate just based on kind of informed estimate was to get in the fourth quarter have of total forgiveness by the end of march and then by the end of june is kind of at least what were thinking about william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you very much and then one big question for you vince d in your prepared remarks you gave some numbers that suggest a pretty significant increase in utilization of the digital network with your customer base you guys had been pretty diligent and thoughtful about your branch network over the years and youve slowly consolidated it im wondering if the increase in utilization of the digital network changes the way you might approach the decisions around the branch network if you could talk about that and thats all thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i appreciate the question its a great question i think that obviously in this environment theres been lets say an accelerated educational process for clients we had such a huge increase in adoption in those digital channels weve always focused on the interface with the client we always believe that we what we can control because were not we dont have unlimited budget was how easy it is for a consumer to interact with us and thats really what we focused on the interface i think our folks did an exceptional job with our website id recommend if you havent been on it go on and take a look at our website its designed in a way thats very easy and intuitive to purchase products and services or view educational content the ability to put that out is going to make changes the educational process that took place through covid19 will certainly push users to that platform we had a process weve closed a lot of branches i mean weve consolidated i dont even know the numbers but generally to a year over the last five years have been consolidated some of it throughout ma some of it opportunistically because of the change in client preferences i would expect that to continue but i will tell you that throughout this process a number of clients have written me letters sent me emails stopped me on the street and asked when are your lobbies going to be open small business customers still like going to the branch and they want to go and make their deposits at the branch because in many instances they still use cash coin and currency and they need to come in clients when they have issues like to stop in so i think its going to be there was an article that sp just did it illustrated our concept branch i think there will be fewer branches the design of the branch and how we deliver content on products and services will change but there will always be a need there may be fewer of them and were going to continue to look at that to drive efficiency so our strategy was to invest in the front end system to invest in the ability to provide products and services in a comprehensive manner focusing on the interface and then making sure our branches are branch system is fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 optimized and structured appropriately to accommodate conversations and that content so anyway thats i see that continuing that trend continuing it will afford us with an opportunity to operate more efficiently as we move forward anyway william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you very much for the question operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys most of my questions theyre answered so just a couple of housekeeping just vince i think you said on the service charge incomes you expect i know its down this quarter but you did expect some bounce back i think you said it was like down and now its down its only down kind of that range just how do we think about that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania you got it brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so just want to make sure i got that right and then just with the accretion numbers yeah i guess just a timeframe we should think about recovering that remaining whatever million vince i guess given the some of the balance i guess the dropdown this quarter just most of that is captured by maybe the end of next year is it going to i guess is that fair to think about that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean the vast majority would be i say over the kind of the two years two to three years i would probably say its probably reasonable by the end of next year i would think we have kind of the bulk of it kind of coming through i mean its a function of prepayments too right so fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yes vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and as we said more of the loans end up prepaying or go different rebuying government programs or something you have more of that that will come in but id say a two to threeyear kind of timeframe brian is probably reasonable brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and then just the last one for me guys the impact of the ppp on margin i guess this quarter i guess or just in general i guess your comment on that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean its actually additive to the margin i mean if you look at i mentioned the yield at i mean brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yes vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania funding it basically deposits of basis points so you have a spread of about so if you do the math its having basis points basis points i would say to the margins during that short period there so its going to be a function of how long those are around as far as them coming through and how long we havent funded with demand deposits right so at some point the customers are going to start to use those funds and then your mix of how youre funding it will change but what i can say for certain is with the second quarter impact there was a spread which as you can see if you do the math that is obviously additive to the margin going forward brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay okay thats helpful thanks vince thats all i had vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you operator thank you that was the last question i would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 vincent j delie jr chairman president chief
