corporations second quarter earnings call we appreciate you joining us this morning ill provide remarks on our highlevel results and operations before turning it over to glenn to cover our financial results in greater detail websters results in the quarter illustrate the competitive advantages of our funding profile while we experienced some temporary nim headwinds as we pulled liquidity onto our balance sheet early in the quarter overall our diverse and distinctive deposit gathering channels provided steady funding as we grew deposits significantly and increased our off balance sheet liquidity glenn will provide more specific detail on balance sheet trends in his remarks in the face of industry challenges we are proud of our financial performance in the quarter on an adjusted basis we generated eps of while we saw a modest quarteroverquarter decline in net interest income we anticipate a positive trajectory through the remainder of the year our other income statement lines exhibited positive trends as we grew noninterest income and maintained flat expenses despite maintaining a higher than normal liquidity position we generated an adjusted roa of just under and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of we grew our deposits by over in the quarter our robust funding profile positioned us to continue to serve our clients and we grew our loan book by our strong deposit growth allowed us to reduce our loan to deposit ratio to which provides us balance sheet flexibility as we move forward if you turn to slide i want to reemphasize the unique funding model that enabled this performance we have a diverse set of deposit generating businesses each with distinct client dynamics this model provides us with a funding advantage as characteristics of the various businesses partially mitigate the effects of general industry deposit outflows while we are not immune to the higher funding costs the banking industry is experiencing we like our competitive positioning on that front and we have the ability to grow core deposits through environments in which others are challenged our consumer deposits are largely originated in footprint to long tenured clients our billion plus of hsa deposits are all in individual customer accounts and nearly all are within fdic insurance limits as most of you are aware this is a particular unique source of low cost and long duration deposits within commercial banking we have billion of business banking deposits that share similar characteristics to the consumer book the remainder of commercial deposits are diverse by industry customer type and geography and are aligned with our relationship banking model and finally interlink a platform we acquired earlier this year provides readily available core deposit funding at a low cost of acquisition with nearly all deposits covered by fdic insurance on slide you can see that not only did we grow deposits smartly but immediately available liquidity also increased to billion which covers just under of our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits our balance sheet remains in exceptionally sound condition as glenn will discuss further on subsequent slides things remain stable from an overall credit perspective while we do not see any significant signs of broad credit weakness we continue to act prudently and proactively with respect to managing our existing loan portfolio and onboarding new credit given the existing macro uncertainties i want to once again touch briefly on our office portfolio you can see that on slide as thats continued ph i note to be an area of market focus we have proactively reduced the size of our nonmedical office portfolio which is now down by almost million over the last year or roughly weve done so without incurring significant losses as our chargeoff rate on this relatively small portion of the office portfolio is under on an annualized basis the overall credit characteristics of this portfolio have not changed materially as you can see in the figures we provide on ltv debt service coverage and other metrics while our criticized and classified loans are up modestly from last quarter they are down relative to fourth quarter and the year ago period given the proactive actions weve taken webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 consistent with my comments above while we are pleased with performance to date we fully appreciate the changing dynamics in commercial real estate and we continue to manage our portfolios and credit selection accordingly and prudently ill now turn it over to glenn to provide more details on the quarter glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap and adjusted earnings we reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million earnings per share of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and eps of excluding onetime mergerrelated expense of million merger expenses were primarily related to professional fees severance and technology cost next ill review our balance sheet trends beginning on slide total assets were billion at period end down million from the first quarter largely as a result of shifting from onbalance sheet cash to offbalance sheet liquidity sources at quarter end we held billion in cash on the balance sheet which approximates the level of cash we anticipate holding going forward loan growth was million principally driven by commercial banking our security balances were relatively flat in the quarter as we reinvested proceeds from maturities to sales deposits grew billion in the quarter and we reduced our borrowings by more than billion deposit growth was achieved despite a million seasonal decline in public funds quarteroverquarter as a result of the loan and deposit growth our loan to deposit ratio was at quarter end down from in the prior quarter our capital levels remained strong common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was tangible book value increased to a share with retained earnings exceeding the impact of aoci and a small share repurchase unrealized security losses included in tangible book value increased to million after tax from million last quarter driven by higher rates in a steady interest rate environment we anticipate roughly million of this will accrete back into capital annually loan trends are highlighted on slide in total we grew loans by million or on a linked quarter basis loan growth was concentrated in the commercial bank where we continue to see opportunities in strategic segments ci grew million with an additional million in sponsor commercial real estate was up million mortgage warehouse grew million consistent with seasonal trends and residential mortgage grew million the yield on the portfolio increased basis points and excluding accretion the loan yield increased basis points floating and periodic loans remained at of total at quarter end we provide additional detail on deposits on slide total deposits of billion from prior quarter were growth was primarily driven by interlink and time deposits time deposit growth was driven by billion of brokered deposits and million in consumer banking cds roughly half the consumer time deposit growth was from existing clients shifting into higher yielding products a quarter was from the balance increase of existing clients and a quarter of the growth came from new clients commercial deposits grew million when excluding the seasonal decline in public funds we have started to recapture funds that were diversified across financial institutions earlier this year were seeing new opportunities for growth in transactional accounts our total deposit costs were up basis points to basis points for a cumulative cycle to date total deposit beta of webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 on slide we have updated the forward progression of our deposit beta assumptions we anticipate a total cumulative deposit beta of by the first quarter of which is up modestly from our prior projection due to client preferences for higher yielding deposit flows as you can see in the chart on the right we expect the pace of our deposit cost increase to moderate over the next few quarters moving to slide we highlighted our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for the prior period net interest income was down million or linked quarter primarily reflecting increased funding costs adjusted noninterest income was up million while expenses remained effectively flat the net interest margin was down basis points from prior quarter with basis points from temporary actions to increase our liquidity position and the efficiency ratio was ill discuss each major line item on subsequent slides on slide we highlight net interest income which declined million linked quarter or net interest margin excluding accretion decreased basis points from the prior quarter our yield on earning assets excluding accretion increased basis points over prior quarter and the total cost of funds was up basis points the change in the cost of funds was driven by mix change in deposits as well as additional liquidity we added early in the quarter a significant driver for the linked quarter decline in nim was an increase in the average balance sheet liquidity of billion while this did not impact net interest income it had basis point impact on our nim relative to prior quarter higher funding costs drove the remainder of the decline and deposit competition ph increased on slide we highlight our noninterest income for the quarter on an adjusted basis noninterest income was up million linked quarter primary driver was in increased valuation marks of the client hedging activity transaction activity tied to commercial clients remained slow in the second quarter but were seeing some signs of modest improvement in the coming quarters the yearoveryear decrease was primarily driven by million in lower client hedging activity million in lower loan related fees million in lower client deposit fees million due to outsourcing of our consumer investment services platform noninterest expense is on slide we reported adjusted expense of million in line with the prior quarter a reduction in professional fees and technology expense was offset by higher employee benefit expense and deposit insurance slide details components of our allowance for credit losses which was up million over prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we incurred million in provision expense with loan growth representing million and the remainder due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast you see our allowance coverage ph to loans increased slightly to basis points slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets increased million from prior quarter nonperforming loans represent basis points of loans nonperforming assets remained within the range of the past year and were down million from a year ago commercial classified loans as a percent of commercial loans declined to from as classified loans declined million on an absolute basis net chargeoffs in the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis notably we divested million in commercial real estate loans in the quarter vast majority of which were secured by office properties these divestitures generated million chargeoffs webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 on slide we continue to maintain strong capital levels all capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and internal targets our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was tangible book value increased to a share including the afs mark on our securities portfolio common equity tier ratio would be approximately as of june we dont anticipate well be subject to explicit changes to the regulatory capital requirements but are well prepared for any potential changes as evidenced by our capital ratios inclusive of aoci and our strong liquidity position ill wrap up my comments on slide with our full year outlook we expect to grow loans in the range of to with growth focused in strategic segments we expect to grow core deposits to with the year end loan to deposit ratio in the mid we expect net interest income of billion million on a nonfte basis excluding accretion approximately million in accretion would be added to net interest income outlook for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to the outlook our net interest income outlook includes the growth expectations above along with the basis point fed hike next week we assume the fed funds rate will remain flat for the remainder of at we currently expect nim to improve by to basis points from the second quarter level to the remainder of the year noninterest income should be in the range of million to million core expenses are expected to be in the billion billion range with an efficiency ratio in the to range we expect our effective tax rate in the range of well continue to be prudent managers of capital capital actions will be dependent on the market environment we continue to target a common equity tier ratio of with that ill turn it back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks a lot glenn ill wrap up my remarks today with a short update on our integration and strategic path forward were approaching an important integration milestone this weekend with the conversion of our core operating systems as many of you are aware we took a deliberate and thoughtful approach to the conversion of our core a tremendous

economic profit all within a disciplined risk management framework i want to thank you all for joining us today operator with that glenn and i will be happy to take questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from christopher mcgratty with keefe bruyette woods your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for the update guys glenn on the nii maybe you could talk through the ranges of nii the range of outcomes is it more about the fed is it more about competition and i guess what would it take at this point for you to take a different view of nii thanks glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah thanks so chris i think it is primarily driven by increased deposit costs and increased funding costs as a whole so thats why we adjusted that range down a little bit the second part of your question was john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp its probably a combination christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp im sorry chris its combination of our assumption of fed with one more rate hike and just general deposit competition as you see we see nim expansion coming off this quarter because of the dynamics in our balance sheet but also because of our floating rate loan book and the pace at which we think deposit costs will grow plus we have some good guys coming in the third and fourth quarter with respect to kind of core commercial growth seasonal growth in lower cost government deposits so thats kind of what factors in to where we are with obviously the governor being just overall higher deposit and funding costs industry wide christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks for that in terms of just the regulation youre comfortably below ph billion but obviously i think the market will expect at some point you will be there can you just talk through the expense webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 angle potentially that youre thinking about and also how your capital targets may evolve and capital return strategies may evolve thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah chris its a great question and obviously were spending a lot of time thinking about it i think its too early to even throw out kind of a wild guess on cost i think the reality is even if youre at billion the trickledown effect of the way youre regulated you certainly need to begin being prepared i actually think our infrastructure with respect to stress testing and the way we measure liquidity weve held ourselves to lcr for a long time even when we didnt have to even premerger so i think we have the infrastructure to deal with whatever regulations come down so i think more than internal costs right i think the impact would be is exactly as you intimated at the end there would be higher capital levels higher liquidity requirements that would have an economic kind of impact on the bank if we have to hold more liquidity and different types of liquidity and have more capital but it would be too early to give you kind of our expectations were just following it closely and as i said i think internally we have the capabilities the systems and the people to be able to deal with whatever comes out as its phased in over time glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah and the only thing i would add to that chris is you saw my comments on our common equity tier even if we were to add in the afs losses wed be at like a from 10plus percent so that would probably be phased in over time christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and is there any contemplation of a share repurchase given the strength of the balance sheet or is it too uncertain on the economy john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no i think as we go into it you may have seen we repurchased million or so of shares to offset grants to employees and colleagues throughout the organization we certainly have the capability to do it in the second half i think we stick to our normal view that i think were good stewards of capital so we look at internal opportunities to deploy capital first we contemplate things like balance sheet restructuring we look at tuckin acquisitions for hsa and other things but if thats not there and we continue to generate the kind of capital we are and it looks like the credit environment remains stable youd see us absolutely looking at share repurchases but i think its a matter of time and our view of how stable the ultimate credit environment is as we move through the third and fourth quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks john john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks chris webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 operator your next question comes from casey haire with jefferies your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc glenn question on the nim forecast in the back half of the year that lift of to bps is that immediate it feels like it could be given the borrowing where the borrowings ended the quarter it feels like it was back half weighted just some color there and in the interest the spot deposit costs and interestbearing deposits glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes so let me hit that so yeah youre right i mean basis points come back to us and thats the function of the balance sheet liquidity plus bringing down balances held with the fed which were averaging plus billion in the second quarter so you get that basis points there you get another basis points the basis points on loan impact so you have about basis points of nim coming from the variable book and then another basis points from the fixed book so thats basis points right and in the investment portfolio same sort of thing you pick up about basis points there and then of course further deposit repricing and the thing id point out there is its probably negative so to basis points not as severe as it was first quarter second quarter obviously because weve built up some of the key the higher cost products like interlink and brokered cds but yeah you should begin to see that come back in beginning in the third quarter significantly on the second part of your question i think our exit cost was on deposits and thats like ph bps casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thats total or is that interest bearing glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thats total casey haire q analyst jefferies llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 okay and then the beta assumption through first quarter so i guess if the fed is on hold and were higher for longer is that beta can that beta go higher and then what is the beta forecast assumed for dda mix at of the total deposits glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so a couple of things in there our forecast is that the fed increases next week and stays at for the rest of the year so that ties to that that youre seeing on the slide and so i think thats the first part of your question i think there is a lag there has been a lag on fed increases and how thats trickled down to the deposit bases its been like a quarter or two for the most part and thats again why you see some of that acceleration in the second quarter i think the second part of your question was on dda deposits as a percent as a percent of total and for us if you look at it i think that fourth quarter of we were a combined organization right one of the things thats happened here is we have built interlink and broker and so thats increased the total deposit base so if you look at that for full year basis youre probably in a range of to by the fourth quarter if you were to strip out things like interlink and broker youre probably close to john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and casey this is john i think your last one of your questions in there was what are your assumptions if what happens to beta if the cycle is longer i think our view is could it tick up a little more i guess but that most of if they stay flat and higher for longer that most of the beta and most of the increase would be captured by you could have a little drift up over time but we think the behavior is moderate casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay got it thats fair on dda mix too on the interlink growth last one for me just on the capital management front did you guys buy back any shares as the share count was lower but i didnt see any mention of it and then just any updated thoughts on appetite for buyback activity going forward glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah casey i just mentioned answering mcgrattys question that we did about million of share repurchases in the quarter to offset grants to employees so yes we did and i mentioned that well have the same sort of disciplined approach we are generating capital a good amount of capital obviously annually and were slightly above our cet1 target so to the extent we dont have internal opportunities to deploy capital or a really compelling balance sheet restructuring we would look as long as there werent signs of significant credit deterioration we would look to deploy some level of capital and share repurchases as we look to the second half of the year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thank you webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 operator your next question comes from matthew breese with stephens inc your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc maybe to start could you just give us some idea of what incremental loan yields are today and assuming theyre higher how has that impacted originations and pipeline on a monthtomonth basis john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah its a complex question while we get the yields let me start with credit spreads it could be an interesting way to start so there is no question that i think us like most of the industry are being kind of more demanding and more disciplined in terms of where were generating loans and how were generating loans we have seen increases in credit spreads so if you think of obviously the reference rates and sofr and prime continue to move up but were also seeing a level of expansion i was talking to the team yesterday in kind of constructionrelated cre you can get basis points plus with respect to additional credit spread from ph cre premarch on other sort of more traditional and predictable cre outside of office which obviously people arent doing its more like basis points and then on ci the teams seeing kind of to basis point expansion in credit spreads so take those credit spreads over the expanding reference rates and glenn can give you the yields glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so matt the yields on both the quartertodate and for the month of june were sort of the mid right so obviously its going to be driven by mix and product mix but generally when we look at the quarter and you look at the months its in the mid matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great thank you and then i was curious on the million in office loans that you divested im just curious how that process went how liquid was the market for office loan buyers what kind of comfort did that give you on potential loss content on the rest of the office book and is there any more youre looking to do there john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah its a great question again and theres not a way to give a kind of definitive quantitative answer i think weve clearly seen and as youve seen im really proud of the team we reduced office exposure by over the last four quarters with really minimal hit to capital and minimal credit loss webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 there is no question that the amount of liquidity and the eagerness of purchasers in the market for loans is its more expensive now than it was four quarters ago just given kind of peoples view of the market there still is a lot of liquidity a lot of private capital as you know out there and so that is encouraging to us in terms of our ability if weve picked good pieces of property to finance at the end of the day if there is alternative uses for those properties or even if there has been a valuation decline but there is still clearly equity in the property weve been able to find buyers this last quarter we said that million represented roughly to of our chargeoffs in the quarter but we think obviously with respect to noncritical and strategic office properties thats the right move now so its getting more expensive i think well continue to being proactive we feel really good about the fact that weve pared the portfolio thoughtfully and its now down to below billion nonmedical office but there are buyers of this real estate at a reasonable price still out there although its obviously getting more expensive to execute on kind of balance sheet moves like that matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great and then last one for me in late june there was some joint interagency guidance from the fdic the fed the occ on prudent commercial real estate loan accommodations and workouts and i would like your perspective on how this plays out practically what does it look like in terms of how you help customers or how you can help customers what are the expected tools that can be used and how will these accommodations and workouts be disclosed if and when they occur john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah another loaded question that i dont know i can answer with specificity but ill give you my perspective during obviously and im not going to go back to a history lesson but in the early obviously the regulators with respect to real estate really killed the banking market and accelerated and were very prescriptive with respect to the way they looked at restructuring during the great financial crisis when i was chief credit risk officer here i thought they were very constructive in terms of making sure that as long as you were realistic with respect to the return you were getting on the loans that they knew it was in everyones best interest to modify and were seeing that general tone and tenor i think from the regulators again which will be constructive so my view is and our view at least internally in the bank is you dont want to artificially kick the can forward if theres not a reasonable credit to be renewed and i think the regulators are still going to hold us accountable to making sure that were taking appropriate losses were recognizing nonaccrual loans and that were not able to modify things artificially that really arent good loans but so far were able to work with our sponsors and real estate owners and either get a little bit of additional proceeds and in consideration we underwrite a slightly higher ltv if the cap rates have changed the value and so far on that weve seen kind of a constructive stance and i think from our vantage point thats really helpful but it also doesnt give us the opportunity to sort of artificially kick forward a loan that really shouldnt be kicked forward and i think thats the way the analysts and the investors will see it in that if you dont have enough cash flow to service your loan youre going to have to take appropriate action and classify and risk rate the loan appropriately webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 if youve got cash flowing loans but its just going to take longer to repay or youve got a higher ltv i think were going to have some flexibility in being able to work with the borrowers to a good outcome matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great i appreciate it ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from brody preston with ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone how are you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i did want to follow up maybe just on the office line of questioning so we saw another bank that just reported that sold their medical office portfolio and it was only like a mark maybe it was a bit noncore for them but i guess could you maybe speak to the puts and takes between maybe keeping even medical office around is that a core kind of product for you do you have deposits tied to those borrowers is that something where you just evaluate your overall office exposure even if its something like medical office you might look to kind of exit it now as opposed to waiting later down the road john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah specifically the medical office i dont think so its such a different animal right now its still really strong vacancies are low rates have held and so our portfolio is not particularly big and right now its a profitable business and often times and most of the time we had ancillary revenue either coming from deposit liquidity or fees or other cash management products so i dont think thats in our strategic wheelhouse right now and i dont think we feel from a credit perspective its something we need to do brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 got it okay thank you for that i did want to just ask on the available for sale portfolio and im sorry if i missed it in the deck but do you happen to have what the effective duration of that portfolio is and then could you tell me what the assumed conditional prepayment rate youre using in the duration ph calculus glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure so the duration is years and the cpr were using is in the high single digits brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then i just want to ask just the credit seems to be holding up really well but it seems like last quarter across the industry there was a couple of oneoffs this quarter across the industry there is a couple of more oneoffs and there is some kind of indication that maybe especially in middle market maybe youre starting to see some pressure on borrower balance sheets how are your conversations with borrowers particularly in middle market evolving today and how are they handling higher interest rates or what are some of the key areas of pressure that theyre identifying john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah and again ill try and be brief but give you some insights i think youre right i think everybody is surprised that credit held on so strongly and you look at our metrics were not seeing correlated risk across portfolios were being proactive obviously in office just given the secular dynamics there i think from a risk rating perspective if you look across the industry that was kind of stable i think probably now the bias is to downside so although as you said its really only resulted in kind of oneoffs from a loss perspective i think most folks in the industry expect there to be a little more bumpy as we go forward in the next several quarters and its probably is to your point that the cumulative impact of debt service higher interest rates higher input costs inflationary pressures on wage and other input costs into businesses so we hear its funny what we hear mostly from our clients is the same thing its about they feel good about demand they feel good about their customers confidence theyre still having trouble finding people to either work in their plants or to work on their counter of their service company but i no doubt that higher costs input costs and higher interest rates put more pressure on them but were not seeing much capitulation brody and as i said if you look across all of our different sectors and our geographies which we do all the time to look for any sort of correlated performance behaviors or risk were not really seeing anything right now and our chargeoffs this quarter at basis points are actually basis points below our five year average chargeoff rate prepandemic and of those were on proactive office sales so it certainly hasnt shown yet through a lot of the statistics brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you for that and then one last one for me and again i apologize if i missed it i was hopping from another call just on the fee income i know its not a huge driver of revenue at this point but i guess glenn what would cause you to kind of be at the high end or the low end of the guidance and i think the last time we talked we had spoken maybe about commercial swap activity picking up a little bit in the back half of the year do you still feel like thats a possibility webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean we do see some modest increase in activity or forecasting some modest increase in the second back half of the year but thats all within our guide range as well brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler your line is open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co john i heard your comments on credit and i know this is relatively small dollars but you had about a million uptick in commercial nonmortgage nonaccruals this quarter and it looked like day day delinquencies in that bucket also went up is there anything unique to that bucket or any particular industry thats being challenged john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no the delinquencies are mostly administrative i would say that the two one was a nonoffice cre and one was a ci loan we had a couple of credits that led to that they were really kind of oneoff i was talking with jason soto our chief credit risk officer who said you try and look for dynamics there and it really was more idiosyncratic management misstep so it happens inflows and outflows and we work at it proactively but i again i havent seen anything there that leads to that there is a parade of issues behind either of those credits mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and given what you see today on credit and for loan growth how should we be thinking about provisioning levels for the back half of the year john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 yeah i mean glenn can talk from a technical cecl perspective i think were pretty conservative weve got a good were a top decile among our peer group coverage ratio right now cecl coverage were thoughtful about the uncertainties in the macro market a lot of it is driven by the inputs of risk rating dynamics and the more you proactively deal with troubled credits obviously that helps you in terms of what you have to post going forward my personal view is id like to keep a robust coverage ratio but its all going to be dependent upon how credit performs what the risk migration is like and how proactive we are on being able to resolve remedy get payoffs or sell criticized and classified assets mark so i would say kind of its stayed the course look at what we have been doing think about movements in the portfolio and its probably similar levels to what youve seen in the last few quarters mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then lastly should we expect merger charges from sterling to wrap up in the third quarter post systems conversion will they be done behind at that point glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah mark its expected to wrap up in the fourth quarter but youve seen that trending down so yes mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you mark operator your next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i get this question a lot and i wanted to see how you answer it what do you make of the argument that if rates stay higher for even longer the difference in peak deposit betas between banks should narrow and banks that have lower betas like yourselves will see a larger increase in deposit rates than some of your peers that already have higher betas webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp i think it will depend on by bank it depends on the composition and for us as you know we have has which basically has through the cycle beta of and so thats a differentiator for us if you looked at our other lines of businesses between the commercial and the consumer business ph those all have different betas as well so i think a lot of that our commercial beta is i think our consumer beta is so i think a lot of that will be driven by the mix shift and the funding profile of each institution john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah manan my view would be similar its kind of an interesting question you asked because you could think about that as kind of everybody kind of reversion to the mean but i do think as glenn said it really ultimately is about your deposit mix and your ability you saw us drive growth in higher cost deposits in the quarter for a number of strategic reasons we have expected growth in the second half of the year in our core commercial franchise in our consumer book in our business banking book in our government operating deposit book so those will be things that should help us mitigate some of the impact of overall higher deposit cost around so i think you cant make the assumption that everybody ends up in the same place if were in this situation for a long period of time manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc very helpful and did you say through the cycle deposit beta on hsa deposits glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah i did and if you looked at our i think for the quarter we said cycle to date beta was on our deposits and if you peel that back hsa cyclization is consumer is at commercial is at and the difference being the higher beta products that we had in the second quarter interlink broker cds and so thats how you ladder up to that number but there is differences within the portfolios and there is differences within the product sets manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc and is there any environment in which competitive factors push up the beta on those hsa deposits glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp its interesting because the customers that are really searching for yield in that product become investors and they move their balances into investment options so when you think about that we think about our million hsa accounts of those are spenders so they have relatively small balances of like in account and so its not as meaningful for them and the savers have a larger balance like or but as soon as they get a little more scale then they become investors and so investors got a lower demand ph of product lower dda savings balance and a higher investment balance for those that are in that savings category and decide to move to investors still generally if webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 you look at their balances at to are multiples of what the spenders are and like i said of our customers are spenders ph to that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats very helpful thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you manan operator your next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so first to follow up on the comments around the positive trajectory for nii for the rest of this year what are you guys assuming in terms of additional noninterest bearing outflows in that assumption glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so i think on an absolute basis were in the quarter on noninterest bearing ph of million million and that will ebb and flow i mean like john said we have some municipal funds that have come in some additional transactional funds that come in so i think well probably end the year within that range given the puts and takes steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay so pretty flat from here okay glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 im curious on the deposit competition side it seems like most banks were building liquidity this quarter and its really played out right were not seeing that as much for so when we look at the competitive environment is it easing a bit here in the third quarter john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i dont think the competition is easing it may be because the fed has paused and its been such a big increase that people who are rate sensitive given and the banks wanting additional liquidity it was a perfect storm in so i do think that the pressure on deposit pricing eases but im not sure steve i wouldnt characterize it as the competition for deposits easing so i think thats kind of why youre seeing most of the folks in the industry take a position that the increase in deposit costs kind of moderate but continue because obviously we all think that deposits are the most valuable thing and obviously were relying more and relying more on our relationships than just going out and chasing deposits for rate but i think competition stays strong but i think the pressure on pricing moderates steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then finally on the regulatory front so period end assets are almost billion right were all waiting for the new regulations for banks above billion to hit and i know we need to wait for the details but john whats your messaging internally at this point to the team are you looking at this saying okay were close enough whatever comes out were going to work to comply with it now or do you feel like you have time to comply with what comes out like how are you viewing it at this stage thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes its great its a good question ill reiterate a bit of what i said before and maybe add to it so im really happy with our risk infrastructure our regulatory relationships right now remain strong its always been a real focus of mine and of the team as i mentioned earlier in response to another question weve already complied with lcr we obviously we stress test internally even though we dont have obligations to disclose externally and so we feel like and with this merger that took us over billion we are on the path to heightened standards already so weve built the infrastructure i think to continue to comply and to continue to execute in whatever the regulatory framework is so when people ask how much additional cost will it be and so on and so forth i think i feel really good about where we are from a people a process and a system perspective the real hit is going to be if there is one what are the actual capital and liquidity requirements as we move forward i think your point is a good one as we move from billion to billion to billion were clearly going to have to comply and be ready for whatever is out there we will likely when these new regulations are implemented have an opportunity and a time to adopt so we wont rush well make sure were compliant but well get ourselves fully prepared so the way i look at it is i dont feel like were going to be blindsided and its going to slow us down significantly therell be if there are additional capital and liquidity requirements those will be what theyll be but on a relative basis theyll be for all of our peers and our competition and i feel good that well have time to make sure that we implement whatever is there webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 so the message to the team as you said is keep doing what youre doing make sure that were meeting all the heightened standards as above billion bank and obviously get ready for whatever is going forward with respect to our internal systems our risk management processes make sure we have the right people and i feel really good about that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you steve operator your next question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james your line is open daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey danny daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc most of my questions have been asked and answered at this point but its that one more followup on the fee income side and i apologize if i missed this my call cut out for a second there but just curious what your expectations are obviously the guidance came down but in terms of a rebound long term i mean what does it take to get back to where you were and then how does that impact the expense side as well john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah let me give you ill give you at the high level dan and then glenn can fill in any of the charts were a strong commercial bank with strong relationships and we crosssell lots of products and so we really grew our noninterest income on the backs of our commercial banking relationships and so what you saw driving higher levels of noninterest income last year were things like swap fees syndication fees loan fees equity tag investment realizations from our sponsor and specialty group and a lot of that given the market dynamics has kind of stopped obviously with the higher interest rates where none of the industry is selling as much swap business and then with respect to our business in particularly commercial real estate and sponsor and specialty where we have more capital market fees when the kind of ph ride stopped for a bit in march weve seen a slowdown so im telling you that because i think those would be the dynamics that when we reach a more normalized environment which i think we expect to be in fourth quarter or first quarter of next year but weve been a bit webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 conservative in our forecast that youve seen in our guidance we start to drive a lot of those ancillary treasury management fees fx fees swap fees capital markets fees equity tag investment realization so that would be a driver immediately but as a management team you can imagine were also focused on making sure that were we over time can have a higher percentage of our revenue in fee generating businesses as well so thats a strategic emphasis for us daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific and thats all i had thanks for the color john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank your line is open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning a indiscernible bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc indiscernible question hey you discussed about million in cost savings post the sterling conversion which is expected by this weekend as noted you also mentioned that several back office systems have already been consolidated and i think the acceleration of your tech plans will lead to further synergies can you just remind us do some of these cost savings come through this year or is the entire amount for full year and is the million still the cost savings estimate john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah no its a great question so let me give you little perspective so when we announced the transaction we announced about a synergy in cost saves of our combined run rate that was a combination of fte reduction without having our office and corporate real estate space getting rid of duplicative vendor contracts and then obviously as you mentioned completion of the conversion back office efficiency synergies a combination of the call centers some branch consolidation all of that sort of post conversion so obviously the conversion being pushed out to months from close stop some of the realization of that in the interim weve also talked about the fact that when we made our announcement on cost synergies we didnt have a wage inflation rate we didnt contemplate at the announcement the acquisition of bend and hsa the acquisition of interlink about million higher in fdic costs and other general inflationary pressures so i think the way to look at it is we do have opportunities that probably will be realized in because were doing the conversion now and then were consolidating call centers and were looking at back office synergies webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 once weve retired some of the subledgers so the remaining cost savings that were talking about there probably wont impact materially but the reality is you saw us keep our core noninterest expense flat period over period which is sort of bucking the trend in the industry and the general synergies of putting these two banks together have enabled us to keep our efficiency ratio in the low during a period of time obviously when expenses are getting higher and higher so the way we look at it is we benefited from realizing a good amount of the million target about some of that has been offset by additional investments and acquisitions we do have opportunities in the back half of to get more efficient which will benefit our run rate in but as weve said all along this is really a growth story and were going to continue to invest in our differentiated businesses and if you look at what jack and i said jeez almost three years ago when we announced the transaction that two years into the transaction we would be posting a high teens roatc and roa above and an efficiency ratio in the to range we posted that at year end we posted that this morning and we expect to post that again on for the full year so we feel like were delivering the financial results and certainly being one of the most efficient banks in our peer group if not the most efficient is helping us do that bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for that color maybe just one question on deposits the interlink balances reached billion which is over two quarters and i believe thats versus your target of about billion john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so im just kind of curious is that still your target can you pull further into that i think on the call earlier you mentioned seeing some new opportunities for growth in transactional accounts maybe you could just give a little color on where you see the deposit like where growth will come maybe in the second half of the year glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah its a good question so interlink was billion end of period interlink was just under billion in the first quarter obviously were at billion i think the growth in that will moderate over the next couple of quarters so im indiscernible probably in a range of million to million somewhere around there but certainly not the increase that you saw in the second quarter so youll see growth sort of moderate from that point on we had a target of billion to billion so i think by the fourth quarter well probably be at or slightly under that target bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 thanks bernard operator your next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good morning thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc like most of i was looking for is answered but as you look at the loan yields you talked about better spreads do you think that that can still move higher as we go through the year if the fed moves as expected john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah we do obviously well get if we get another rate increase the reference rates will slide up a bit but from a credit spread perspective i think my base case would be that we do the dynamics are interesting and people are choosing to play in different sectors and different asset classes and loan demand is sort of unpredictable its slower in a bunch of areas and there is some decent demand that we expect in the back half of the year so i think us and the rest of the industry will continue to be thoughtful about deploying capital and making sure that were getting paid for risk so i expect that credit spread and structure from a banks perspective from the lenders perspective will continue to modestly improve as we go into the second half jared glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah the only thing i would add to that jared is of our book is floating or periodic and so i think in the quarter we ended at like or yield on the book and so as you look out again were assuming basis points at the fed next week so youre probably adding a couple of basis points in the third quarter couple in the fourth quarter of the loan for the total book jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks jared operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to john ciulla webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript
