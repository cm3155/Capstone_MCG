a great pleasure to be with all of you sorry good morning everybody and thank you begoña great pleasure to be with you all and thank you for joining as a reminder we have recently announced a last step towards one santander we finished the creation of the five global businesses which we began a few years ago i will come back to this in more detail in a moment but i would like to note that any reference to these global businesses today relate to the new business definitions that were communicated last december so the focus today will be first main highlights of our results an update on our strategy héctor will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then ill conclude with a few closing remarks on our guidance for so the high level messages were presenting record results billion we have delivered again on all our financial targets our customer focus and scale are driving consistent sustainable profitable growth in we added million customers and our revenue increased double digit and we did this as we continue and something weve reiterated yearafteryear we are investing for the future and we are also making excellent progress towards a more simple and more integrated model this is the driver to the improvement in efficiency yearafteryear basis points and its also the driver to increase our profitability this year to above as we committed we have also in strengthened our balance sheet growing deposits sound asset quality again with our guidance and increasing our gross organic capital generation so in summary backed by strong profit growth with less shares following the buybacks our earnings per share grew our tnav and cash dps by and once approved by shareholders we expect our dividend per share to be near higher than last year so just briefly to the income statement again you can see the successful execution of our strategy and a strong top line performance and whats really important is that across all our global businesses this is the case our net interest income rose in constant euros in a context of higher rates and with a special good performance in our retail commercial banking business in europe and mexico net fee income was also higher in this case the network effects are the driver and the two global divisions or global businesses are the corporate bank and payments driving higher fees banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 very important the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle ph i want special focus on the high quality of our revenue where net interest income and fees are more than of total income and drove the vast majority of santanders total revenue growth were growing cost less than revenue so positive operating leverage including investment in our transformation where were already seeing results we achieved record net operating income of billion thats the second highest among our global peers again showing our continued focus on operational performance and finally the strength of our model is again evident in our cost of risk where we finish at bps again better than our guidance indiscernible and therefore delivering on all the targets as i just mentioned so what this means in terms of capital generation and the doubledigit shareholder value creation that resulted from the results were ending the year at the same level as september with a cet1 ratio at and that is after accruing sorry after accruing basis points for the buyback which means it actually would have been at basis points on a likeforlike compared to last year we delivered growth in shareholder value creation again this represents an increase of more than billion in the year and already mentioned increase in cash dps against results once we get shareholders approval in march the reduction in the number of shares through our share buybacks also of course helped and higher payout which we increased from to this year we continue to believe that at these prices share buybacks are one of the most effective ways for us to generate shareholder value since we have repurchased of outstanding shares and buybacks currently deliver a return on investment of close to for our shareholders so let me just spend a few minutes looking at the consistency in the delivery of our plans and our targets step by step we are making our business model stronger we continue to deliver sustained earnings growth year afteryear low volatility high predictability while we increase capital and shareholder remuneration the record results in means a cagr in profit since increasing profitability to from below again improvements each and every year with the exception of covid and at the same time we have steadily grown our capital please remember that when i took over we had a cet1 ratio of so we have a lot more capital and delivering much better results i also want to point you to a couple of numbers which is over the past nine years weve generated approximately billion of capital which weve used to build up cet1 to and that is on top of the billion paid to shareholders over this time period very importantly today shareholder remuneration is five times that of and has grown again every year except for the covid crisis where dividends were halted in light of the ecbs recommendations as we think about value creation this is our framework we presented this one year ago in our new mediumterm plan this is a new face of value creation where we are having a very strong first year as youve seen in todays results we are on track to achieve all the targets and very importantly compounding our equity through increased profits which will result in increasing shareholder remuneration as we deliver this growth and profitability down the road i would like now to spend a few minutes on the completion of this journey towards the five global businesses with retail and consumer dcb which of course is the majority of santander and this is the reason we are confident we will continue to deliver mediumterm targets and beyond the customer focused diversification huge strength at times like this and because we are doubling down on a very unique santander strength which very few can replicate which is our local leadership on our global scale and network banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 we are the only bank in the world that has such a global and end market scale at the same time a million customers globally with a market share over in most of our core markets and operating at scale in every one of them the strength and potential of santanders scale and network again are already evident in the numbers for this year we can serve more customers capture new revenue streams that some of our competitors cannot and it is precisely this network effect which is helping us to grow crossborder flows and you see this already in the very substantial growth in global businesses like the corporate bank and we are increasingly seeing that also in payments and others but very important this scale allows us to invest together once across the group to operate more efficiently and to deliver better customer experience so its a winwin combination both on revenues and efficiency and youre going to see much more of this in the years ahead because this combines at very strong starting point with a strong franchise and in parallel the deployment of our global platforms which include proprietary technology again this is incredibly differential for santander visàvis most of our peers and we are ultimately aiming to be the most profitable retail commercial and consumer bank in every market where we operate were already top three in terms of profitability in eight of our markets but we have a lot more upside im not going to go over the slide but its really a summary just to remind us where we are its the last step we took steps in the last few years in many of our global divisions but now in the retail bank and in the consumer bankdcb we have taken a very important strategic step were operating in this way already during were pulling investments were reducing cost in a structural way and i want to emphasize in a structural way we are already implementing this common business model and investing more efficiently and again improving customer experience and driving sustainable and profitable growth so just briefly the five divisions the retail commercial bank sic retail commercial bank which i will refer to as retail our vision we said it a year ago is becoming a digital bank with branches this means three very important steps first simplifying our product offering and making it digitally available with a branch network of people serving as very powerful sales and valueadded advisory channel in well reduce products by globally and of our products are already fully available through digital channels but very importantly in the second half of the year we did most of this so there is an acceleration in this transformation which héctor is driving second step really important a common operating model across our banks which allows automation at a much higher level freeing up time to talk to customers and focus on valueadded services again dedication of resources and this is a metric well continue to track noncommercial activities dropped in the second half of again a trend that is accelerating youll see more good news of this in the next few years and the third incredibly strategic step is that our global tech platform this is being rolled out in retail commercial this is not a powerpoint this is happening we are leveraging gravity which is our award winning backend where we partnered with google and ods which is our cloudbased frontend which is built by us operating an openbank and tested and working openbank as a reminder is the largest native digital bank in europe in by size of deposits all our retail and consumers are not just retail but our consumer bank dcb all will be converge into this common retail global fronttech starting in with the us this is going to allow us to both drive customer growth but also better efficiency and therefore profitability in a sustainable way so our consumer bank this is digital consumer bank the goal here is to become the partner of choice for our customers and again deliver superior profitability three main points here is in auto and consumer lending were banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 offering bestinclass solutions for our both commercial customers and consumers were benchmarking very much the same as in retail against the best players whether the banks or digital players we want to be number one fastest credit approval fastest onboarding more convenient et cetera the second point is we are and weve done this already for a couple of years managing our oem relationships and our retail relationships globally this is again a very important advantage this means for example we can integrate the large digital ecommerce players just once and of course that is something which is not available to many and expanding our partnerships in europe to latam and the us and third and really important were planning to grow our business and improve efficiency and profitability by deploying these common platforms and there are several theres open bank of course leasing theres buy now pay later which we have built our own buy now pay later its already up and running in europe and this common frontend with oems and dealers again we deployed a new panregional leasing platform in and very important in the us our own open bank ods gravity platform is already technically up and running we expect to launch in the us in the second half of a fully digital offering nationwide and then in to have all our us customers including our current retail customers on that same platform again this is a big driver already behind our numbers improving our efficiency overall but in specific in the us and would be an even bigger driver down the road in our corporate bank were building and have been on this task as a global platform for at least five six years were leveraging our strengths our competitive advantages to ensure we can deepen relationships and have more profitable customer relationship across our markets whilst maintaining the same risk profile and we will continue to pursue the same strategy focusing on customers more than of our revenues are coming from customer revenues and with a very close coordination between the global local teams this is working really well were now having strategic dialogues with customers that were mostly lending customers and that is something which is happening from day one with some of the new teams in the us but theres also a very important opportunity to leverage the brl million existing group corporate and sme customers with these products and of course this will grow collaboration revenues this will deepen our relationships will drive profitable growth growing fees and support our capitallight model i want to also point out some of the numbers on the slide where our corporate investment banking business is already growing faster than the balance sheet and you can see here how total revenues to rwas is improving to and last but not least this is a very predictable sustainable and lowvolatility business delivering consistent profitable growth for the last five six years a very different path from other players so again the goal is to really make our global centers of expertise stronger weve done that in london and were now doing that in the us to make sure we can leverage our network accelerate process automation we will increase asset rotation and this all in all will drive efficiency and profitability improvements in our wealth business we are aiming again to leverage our strengths our global model is aiming to capture growth by leveraging in the case of private banking our strong presence in miami one of the top latin american private bankers so well expand on that basis in the us in our asset manager again leveraging to the strengths we have in verticals such as renewables infrastructure smes again this is something weve already been doing the last few years and in insurance focusing on verticals where we still have upside and growth opportunities like health savings also smes in general again the same principles as for other global division simplification in the case for example of our investment products and building together i want to end by saying the same as for corporate bank that private banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 banking is leveraging this network where we have different businesses working together and this is again a very very unique strength that drives profitability last but not least payments in our payments business its a large and growing and profitable industry we have a unique position were on both sides of the value chain we will use this to become a global leader in payments supported by our current franchise of million customers and million active payment card customers were driving customer growth by offering a bundle proposition as of today this is also allowing us to grow in the open market because our products are competitive with the best we have of revenue coming from the open market and we expect this to continue to grow significantly in and beyond we are leveraging again as in the other divisions and optimizing our use of capex to meet customer needs in our acquiring platform getnet which is already number three in latam is adapting to customers payment ecosystems were also deploying our global cards platform starting with brazil which again will drive significant opportunities for all the countries as we roll this out yeah i want to just point to one specific number in pagonxt where activity increased to reach billion of total transactions and very importantly one of the key metrics we gave you on investor day which is ebitda margin which last year was has risen to this year sorry almost in already so we are focused on growth youll see the numbers but were also focusing on profitability and weve done a big improvement achieved a big improvement this year so let me just give you a very specific example with the us of how these global platforms are being rolled out in different countries i mentioned it already briefly but very important the first technical integration of our proprietary tech for consumer which combines the ods ie the open bank frontend with our gravity backend will be launched in the us in this is a fully digital savings account well start with that in a year from now in the first quarter of well complement this with the transactional offering and really important this provides a scalable platform to strategically continue growing our business including improving profitability and this is already showing in some of the numbers one of the key metrics to look at is retail deposit cost to serve as this has a very important effect on profitability where we can originate more assets but we also need the funding side i want to just remind that we are not and we do not want to be a universal bank in the us as you can see in the screen were not a full retail commercial bank as we are in mexico or spain or some of the big us banks were a consumer bank with a limited commercial multifamily business we are targeting to grow in segments where we have local scale such as consumer commercial again or we can leverage the contribution of the group such as the cib or wealth now with the platform on the retail side we will be much more efficient and héctor will share some of these big numbers you saw them at investor day we are ahead of our plan in terms of improving efficiency on the retail and deposit gathering side and just as a closing remark between and santander us distributed to our shareholders more than billion in dividends so we are confident to reach our profitability targets of in the mediumterm in our mediumterm plan so let me just finish by summing up im not going to go through the slide but i want to give you a sense of these five global businesses underweight in the santander model just to reiterate the importance of retail and consumer this is of our revenues this is where we have the most upside and we already are delivering on some of these platforms im not going to go through the others but i just want to say that this model has already banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 delivered improving profitability and growth basis points improvement in our rote in again by moving to these five global businesses well unlock the full potential of our business model its all now going to be about execution and héctor and i and all the teams are very focused on that so again we aim to become as i said the most profitable bank in each one of our markets so héctor will now take you through the performance in héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you ana good morning to everyone moving on to the income statement remember that as we always do we present growth rates both in current and constant euros as ana already mentioned we achieved a record profit last year with doubledigit revenue and net operating income growth but we also have a very solid quarter with profit growing in euros even after seasonal effects in q4 from the deposit warranty formed contribution in spain and the bank levy in the uk which represent around million posttax underlying trends remained strong as profit excluding the seasonal factors will have grown about in the quarter differences between growth in euros and constant euros became more evident in the quarter as the devaluation of the argentine peso in december introduced some distortions across the pl remember that the full impact of the devaluation across the whole year is entirely recorded in q4 excluding argentina profit would have grown in the quarter including euros and there is no material impact from other currencies so growth in constant and current euros is pretty much the same across all the lines i will now take you through the main lines in the pl in much more detail starting with the revenue there was the strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter which made up more than of total revenue and explained almost all the growth in the quarter in the year this was primarily supported by net interest income in retail as we actively managed interest rates tailwinds in europe and mexico and the positive fee performance of cib and payments mainly in latin america moreover we have delivered doubledigit revenue growth across most of the businesses especially those that benefit most from the network effects revenue in the corporate center improved by more than brl billion due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and the lower impact from the fx hedging nii continue to be the main driver of our revenue growth in it was higher yearonyear in constant euros on the back of basically positive sensitivity to rising rates in europe and mexico and volume growth in the americas in terms of profitability we improved net interest margin yearonyear and every quarter even in q4 if we exclude the distortion from the devaluation we had in argentina this is mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment these gains from credit yields more than outweighted funding cost thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration leading to our robust margin expansion going forward we expect lower rates to drive net interest income higher through our consumer businesses across the group and our retail business in south america while the positive impact from interest rates in europe starts to moderate this is a great example of the power of the diversification that we have turning to fees in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subdued loan demand and weak consumer activity our net fee income grew in constant euros compared to q4 and yearonyear cib and payments grew double digits and compensated the other businesses that were more affected by lower activity or market volatility which again demonstrates the value of diversification we saw a strong growth in cib banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 across regions and products while we strengthened our capabilities in the us total payments volume grew yearonyear backed mainly by brazil europe and mexico on the other hand consumer fees were affected by regulatory changes and lower activity in the us in we expect fees to grow supported by the increase in the number of customers and transactionality as we implement our common platforms and reap the benefits from our new operating model becoming the principal bank for our customers our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at savings from one transformation initiatives are already offsetting our investments in technology and digitalization costs as you have seen remained flat in real terms in and driving the costtoserve as ana mentioned earlier this is reflected in efficiency gains of almost percentage points in the year led by europe which improved percentage points driven by strong revenue growth and cost almost flat in real terms in north america and dcb costs increases likely in real terms reflecting the impact of investments to accelerate transformation and some perimeter effects as mentioned in q4 efficiency ratio is always affected by the dgf change charge sorry if excluded efficiency is fairly in line with that of q3 despite the higher impacts from transformation in the quarter we expect that savings from one transformation will become more evident in and onwards which together with a positive revenue outlook should result in further efficiency gains we are transforming the bank in the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue the efficiencies we have captured from one transformation and the impact of our active spread management in a context of higher interest rates have already contributed basis points in efficiency improvements for example in the us we have already generated around million in savings from transformation and simplification initiatives our global and network businesses continued to contribute to the group profitability and have delivered basis points in efficiency gains in alone multilatins and multieuropeans our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and smes through our regional coverage model grew at very high rates with revenue increasing in alone finally our global technology capabilities have already generated basis points in efficiency so far our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture million savings this year mainly driven by the deployment of gravity new global agreements with vendors and the implementation of new it and ops shared services credit quality remained robust across all of our footprint and in the in line with our expectation supported by our prudent approach to risk strong labor markets and resilience in used car prices mainly in the us the npl ratio was stable and in line with expected levels we met our cost of risk target ending below despite the impact of single name cases and additional provisions in poland related to the swiss franc mortgages spain continues to perform well npl improving basis points and cost of risk is stable yearonyear supported by the quality of the loan book and resilient economic conditions both metrics remained stable across the quarter in other european units the cost of risk is normalizing from very low levels and we expect it to remain below or in line with through the cycle averages normalization continues in the us and mexico in line with expectations and group credit quality trends are indiscernible in brazil as npl ratio improved for the fourth quarter in a row and underlying cost for banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 risk evolution reflects the improving macro conditions going forward we dont foresee signs of significant quality credit deterioration in any subsidiary or at the group level as we have discussed in previous presentations our portfolio is welldiversified by segment product and country moreover our balance sheet is low risk the portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average ltvs in loans decreased as higher rates reduced the credit demand and incentivized early prepayments which was especially evident in europe positive dynamics continued in north america south america and dcb deposits continued to grow well up both yearonyear and in the quarter as deposits inflows more than offset savings used to prepay the mortgages growth in the year was mainly concentrated in time deposits as customers seek higher rates our deposit base is diversified and highly stable using lcr criteria around of our deposits are transactional which are a lot stickier and high proportion of our deposits from individuals are covered by deposits warranty schemes mutual funds rose with broadbased growth across all countries except the us following a year of instability in closing with the capital we maintained a cet1 ratio of in q4 thats percentage points up if we exclude the impact from the new eba guidelines related to the accrual of the share buybacks driven by strong growth gross organic capital generation sorry we continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and this was reflected in a front book return on riskweighted assets of thats up from in equivalent to our rote in excess of which will support profitability going forward finally we continue to enhance portfolio management and balance sheet mobilization improving the percentage of rwas with positive economic valueadded progressing well towards our investor day target of by year these principles of capital management will help us to continue build capital over the next few years and we are confident that our cet1 ratio will remain above even after taking into account the final implementation of basel iii in thats all from my side ana thank you over to you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea group executive chair executive director banco santander sa thank you very much héctor so let me just sum up very briefly so we can go to questions so three very simple points was a very strong year in our new phase of value creation by the way the best is yet to come we grew customers we increased revenue and profits doubledigit in all regions and businesses basically second a lot of this has been driven by the structural change in the model by one transformation to one santander there was also of course an improved operating context especially for our retail business and especially in europe this year and point number three we have further strengthened our already very strong balance sheet increasing our cet1 ratio and very importantly with a very strong credit quality across our footprint and in line with our banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 expectations once again all of this of course leading to the growth in value creation and increase in eps and the highest shareholder remuneration in our history in terms of both cash dividend plus share buybacks so what this means again is weve delivered once again in all on all our targets were on track to achieve the goals that we communicated last year and very important as héctor mentioned youre just seeing the initial results of our transformation in our results youre going to see much more coming in the next few years i want to emphasize again that not only do we have solid foundations but these foundations are already proving and our model that we can deliver sustainable profitable growth increased returns to our shareholders leveraging our model and taking the last step we took this year in our retail and consumer business is absolutely critical to the confidence we have for the next couple of years because it depends on us so our guidance for is will be an even better year for santander you can see here the numbers we are confident that our customer focus diversification will be differential this year visàvis our peers we have many engines and all of the engines are going strong with different focuses in the regions but all our global businesses going strong well continue to accelerate the implementation of our model in the retail and consumer to deliver again on these targets just very briefly if you go down across the slide we continue to see revenue growth midsingledigit in this will be supported by net interest income growth in our consumer businesses you saw héctors presentation that this was the opposite this year ph this year the consumer top line will be much stronger than this year will be also driven in terms of regions in our retail business in south america and mexico with higher growth than europe and very importantly much higher fees in many of our global businesses than we saw this year driven once again both by customer growth and by increased engagement with these customers again the one transformation will be absolutely key in delivering this supporting both our customer growth and our efficiency in terms of cost of risk well be roughly flat against this year on an underlying basis ahead of this year we had some oneoffs this year we said last year and we continue to be in a prudent conservative risk appetite and this is still the case there will be some normalization in our provisions in our consumer businesses based on our current economic forecast and finally we continue to be very positive overall in terms of revenue but very importantly also on efficiency you can see were continuing to target positive operating jaws with flattish costs for next year leading to a cost income below and a return on tangible equity of so were now happy to take your questions again thank you very much banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 question and answer section begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we start the qa session and have the first question which i believe is from ignacio ulargui operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas hi good morning everyone thanks for the presentation and taking my questions i have two questions if i may link a bit to the revenue growth target the first one which is when we look to the midsingledigit revenue growth ana you have just gave a bit of clarity on that but just wanted to give a bit of sense of what would be the driver of the growth nii or fees in that customer engagement that you were commenting before and in terms of businesses which will be in your view the ph billion potential into the second one is focused on cost youve made a case for one transformation throughout the presentation i would just like to get when you mentioned flattish cost what should we looking for going forward what is the advantage that the global footprint will give santander in terms of that in translating into cost growth efficiency gain will continue towards say it in which if i remember correctly was the target of the strategic plan so we are not yet at the end of the journey we are just still in the process of getting there thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa sure so in terms of revenues we of course delivered a very high remember we started a very strong year our guidance for the three years was highsingledigit revenue we delivered doubledigit whats very important is that what youve seen this year is not just the context and the retail side in europe of course with the higher rates but its very much backed by strong customer activity across all businesses you can see that for example in our transactions per customer which grew yearonyear as i said the retail europe business has had very strong tailwinds we do expect this to continue we have positive momentum in all our five global businesses i want to be clear on this theyre going to come from different regions and different sites ill give you a high level and then maybe héctor can give you a bit more detail so again revenue growing at midsingledigit the high level summary of the drivers of this on revenue would be first positive revenue growth in our retail business very high doubledigits in south america brazil chile with a positive sensitivity to falling rates youve seen that already in q4 and of course very strong momentum in mexico if you look at the other important global business consumer which this year suffered from the higher rates this year its exactly the opposite so youre going to see consumer europe and consumer in the us with much better performance next year in terms of the top line than they had this year with volume growth and positive sensitivity to lower rates again thats also going to be good for fees banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 overall in fees theyre going to be driven as héctor said by customer growth increased transactionality and very important as we implement these global platforms youre going to see much more of that but again the highperforming fee businesses will be corporate bank will be payments but maybe héctor you want to give a couple of the highlights for on revenues well take net interest income maybe in another question otherwise its going to be too long a reply but net interest income were also projecting that to rise again mostly in retail and consumer but héctor why you want to give some more héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sure ignacio thank you okay i mean youre going to see the main drivers of growth is going to be retail cib and consumer as ana told midsingledigit positive revenue growth in youre going to see a little bit of the regions basically europe moderating because of the rates and but we dont expect the rates basically to go to the levels of that we had some time ago youre going to see also that the main driver will be south america and whats going on in mexico and then also youre going to see a good growth from coming from the us okay so in that sense youll see also the consumer business globally indiscernible both in europe in the us should grow benefited by credit growth and the progression repricing that we okay and youre going to see in cib higher income from financial transactions all right but asking your i mean answering your question in terms of fee we expect the fee income to grow and thats very important as ana was saying supported by history of being the number one bank for our customers this is quite important the moment that you become the number one bank to your customer fees basically and different revenue grows exponentially and thats going to help us quite a lot ph you can read a lot about connectivity several times but let me tell you why its very important okay connectivity between the global businesses and platforms and the countries is the one that drives a strong free generation okay that basically leads to doubledigit fee growth for most of our global businesses in so we can reach the mid to highsingledigit growth ambition that we have on the fees okay so thats very important and going to cost i dont know if i can comment pretty quickly or you want to comment on it ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa yeah let me just give a high level and then maybe héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa you can give a little bit more detail so whats important in cost is that we want to do better in cost next year than this year were aiming for i would say flattish cost so the goal is to grow customers grow top line have positive operating leverage or flattish cost that is below by the end of you also said how do we see it in obviously we see it better we as i said we intend to go stepbystep sustainably getting better banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 weve had big improvements in we expect also improvements in and reaching at least our target if not better im not changing the guidance im just saying we should do better than that so i want to be clear on that but yes we see many more benefits so and i want to again insist on the structural change in the model and that is what one transformation is allowing us to do were reducing not just efficiency as a ratio but a cost to serve the customer we see a very very strong acceleration in the numbers that you have in the presentation in the second half of the year and we hope to carry that we have positive momentum in all our markets and again as i i used the example of the us because the us is the place where we have an ph atscale auto business but with our common platforms in the consumer and retail banks we will get to be very competitive on the asset sorry on the deposit gathering side you saw in the slide that héctor showed that we had targeted around million in savings in our consumer business in the us by weve delivered million this year we are of course investing investments in the us transformation will not be as large next year so you are going to see a much better performance for the us as a whole in but what i said before we will migrate our existing retail customers in to this new platform so in and again this is only one example with the us driven by one transformation by the common platform that technically is already up and running were just in the regulatory approval process so that should drive increased efficiencies and then again in héctors slide you saw that one transformation is helping us across the board in many other areas in technology so our investments one transformation investments in technology have reached billion but theyve been more than offset in real terms by savings in the global tech platform so again we are were very confident that these numbers will be delivered and will get better you want to give a bit more on the one transformation i guess i was héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah if you allow me complement i think this is one very important bonding ignacio to remember about i mean one transformation is not just about the platforms there are two steps before it which are quite important where youll see the impact on the cost one is simplification have you have seen in one of anas slides you saw the amount of problems that were basically diminishing throughout all the whole organization okay so thats very important thats simplification then the second is automation which basically allows us to automate a huge amount of processes and basically have people in the branches and mainly a lot of amount of our product in our apps which basically allows us to spend more time with clients selling product et cetera and also diminishing the cost ph ot means better service user experience less cost per transaction and client more revenues which is basically means profitability and then youre going to see an inflection point that goes through when the platforms are being deployed and cost should start coming down in a much faster way begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 operator benjamin toms from rbc please go ahead benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd good morning thank you for taking my questions youve guided for uk nim to be down in can you quantify how much nim pressure youd expect to materialize this year in the uk versus the q4 exit rates or if its easier express this in the percentage expectation for nii change in the uk versus and secondly your structural hedge notional in the uk increased by billion or quarteronquarter that compares to a ph fall in current accounts at about billion thats a little counterintuitive can you explain that this is driven by growth in savings deposit or rather it is because you managed the structural hedge using a dynamic rather than a caterpillar approach and could you guide us please for how much change you expect in the structural hedge notional in the uk in thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so yes let me just frame down in terms of the uk nim in the context of our retail business so again our overall retail business for will do better than driven more by the americas in this case both latin america but also the us because its on the consumer side actually so whats very important is again single midsingledigit growth is what we are guiding in terms of revenue growth overall with midsingledigit growth overall ph damien also for net interest income within that the uk who this year has delivered a i believe rote will continue to be doubledigit but will be lower profitability so as you know volumes and the top line net interest income and ill let héctor and josé give you a bit more detail on that but has not been as strong because we have basically managed the uk for profitability so we have a very strong business in mortgages very strong business in current accounts in the uk atscale and competitive and for we expect still doubledigit profitability but lower than this year whats important and again as we think about the one transformation that is going to help maybe not as much as in other countries next year and the us in terms of the top line but its going to help already on the cost side so were guiding uk should be flattish cost next year with low cost of risk in a very very strong balance sheet and so again leading to lower profitability overall in the uk but still doubledigit rote so in terms of i dont know if you want to give a bit more detail on volumes or nim in the uk héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sure i will do so but mainly i think its important to tell you a couple of things as ana said basically retail represents the bulk of the business in the uk mainly mortgages and the current accounts that we have we anticipate in terms of your question in terms of cost flattish cost this is benefiting for the change of the model that were doing and also we believe that cost of risk is going to remain low given the quality of the portfolio and the focus on profitability that were telling you okay its important to understand that high rates and economic slowdown are continuing to affect the loan volumes and the market deposit growth continued to be subdued okay so in we anticipate a challenging competitive environment as the one that you saw during the third and fourth quarter with rates on deposits growing through the year and across all the banks which is basically whats going on there banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 mortgage rates have started to fall since december you saw that following a drop in the market swap rates and in the number of mortgages approvals have started to recover since then so we see a little bit changes in the volume the outlook is driven by an increased competition also which well keep focusing on profitability as ana basically said and were going to leverage on the group platforms to maintain the cost at better levels and to find new revenue streams of course as i said flattish and as a result we anticipate a slightly lower rote but i dont know josé if you want to ph bid exact details josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah no on the hedge in the structural hedge no i think looking at the structural hedge on a quarterly basis it very much it may suffer some volatility due to maturities et cetera if we at the structural hedge in december it was billion it is now billion and at that time the duration was years and its years that shows its very stable we would expect it to keep it stable this is structural so we would not use the hedge to bring forward profits but again this is a structural hedge of the balance sheet and it should remain stable and like you said linked to our interest rate sensitivity basically coming from the current accounts begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question is from antonio reale from bank of america please go ahead antonio reale q analyst bank of america good morning its antonio from bank of america i have two questions please one on the guidance for this year and one on strategy so youve disclosed your guidance for at rote which implies a net profit of more than billion on current tangible book value and this one has been growing so we hope that continues so youd be implicitly guiding between billion and billion net profit this year which will be i mean will be a strong number if delivered and i wont ask you to confirm if thats right but it will be great if you could talk us through how you see the main units performing this year particularly europe brazil and the us actually when you talk about europe if you could comment about spain and the uk given the weakness this quarter that i think would help and my second question is on strategy so youre adding a decent number of investment bankers in the us now over the years weve seen a few of european and international peers have ambitions changed their allocation of capital in their cib businesses in the us which has almost systematically resulted in negative jaws and higher capital consumption can you talk of through what your expectations are here please and possibly share with us some numbers in terms of size of the investment and expected returns on these investments thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so in terms of the guidance again were not going to give specific numbers but you can do the math i think whats important in terms of how we see revenues profits costs et cetera is that the key here is the operating banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 leverage so as i said this is going to be partly revenues and partly costs due to the change in the model this is really important because obviously we have a lot more control we control the top line to a certain degree but theres some external impacts and so what really matters is the operating leverage and the change in the model so we have a structurally lower cost to serve so were going to work very hard on both of those as you know weve moved to managing the bank primarily by global business so if you allow me im going to give you the vision by global business because this is really how we manage this is how we predict we have been managing this way forever by the way at the country level so weve been predicting retail commercial by country its not anything different were now just putting that together and working together in a common business model that héctor explained in detail so again we expect all our five global businesses to do better in this is really important so we expect revenue growth in all our businesses retail commercial dcb in terms of nii is so its obviously very important both our retail commercial and dcb should grow midsingledigit again our retail commercial as i said will do better in the americas this year than in europe but with the exception of the uk the top line will grow in all the countries including spain so revenues will continue to grow in spain poland portugal so again very diversified and i would say very strong momentum in some cases more now fees than net interest income héctor mentioned on the retail commercial side fees were negative to flattish in it should be much more positive in including in europe by the way because theres more activity were seeing positive signs already in the last few months that activity is picking up so fees should grow in retail commercial whats going to be doing better and héctor and i mentioned that already is our consumer business dcb and that is both in europe and in the us so again here both net interest income and revenue growth should also continue to grow fees growing much faster because of higher activity so again very balanced across all the businesses and with different contribution from different geographies and different businesses that are more sensitive positive sensitive positive sensitivity to the lower rates the corporate investment bank will continue to grow very well mostly on fees as youve seen there weve put specifically some operating metrics that show that were not planning to increase the size of the business we just wanted to be more profitable but not the size in terms of capital so that should remain basically where it is today its a of our revenues but the composition of our business is really different from our peers so a lot of transactional banking a lot of corporate customers that we now expect to do more fee and advisory business with i mean both héctor and i have met with a number of top ceos that are now already engaging with us in this new context right so were very very focused on what you said of playing to our strengths of not doing what we are not either the best or could be the best at and leveraging on our corporate relationships which are incredibly strong across latin america europe and increasingly the us so that is really the focus of the strategy there in terms of more specific guidance on specific countries i think i would suggest that the cfo reach out to you if you want some more thank you begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos cobo from société générale please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you for the presentation quick couple of questions for me indiscernible im sorry if youve touched on this already feel free to refer to the call because i couldnt connect ph contiguousantly the thing is that fee income is the area where you have sort of underdelivered you promised a stronger growth indiscernible by midsingle digits in i would like to understand why do you think that was the case and why are you bullish for where you again expect to grow by highsingle digits i understand the hiring in the us but other than that what is driving that strong growth across the board and the second one is about the cost income ratio in digital consumer versus retail just the qualitative comparative were looking at similar cost income ratios in both segments where in theory we would expect the digital consumer to be a more efficient business line than retail with the network could you explain to what extent the cost income ratio in the digital consumer is affected by investment needs and it development and what will be a more normalized cost income ratio thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so let me just very briefly answer the second question youre totally right there is a lot of upside in our consumer business remember that this is mostly europe but also the us so we invested a lot in this especially on the retail side sorry on the well its retail and consumer the bank side is exactly the same backend but youre totally right so that should improve a lot next year so were actually targeting lower cost absolutely for our consumer bank again driven not just by europe but also by the us so yes absolutely that is a big goal we have fees so again were not always going to deliver exactly how we said but were going to deliver because diversification because were working on different angles and so youre going to get some lags one of the reasons our retail commercial bank has had much lower activity especially in europe in some markets and that is a big driver of fees were targeting fees in our retail commercial to turn positive next year so from zero growth this year as you saw in héctors presentation that should be up maybe not much were expecting fees to be much higher in our consumer bank again and as we said our diversification is a huge strength its differential against most of our peers if not all of them so as rates stabilize and come down youre going to see a much better performance in our consumer business not just on the costs side as i just explained but also in revenue growth net interest income and fees and fees should be highsingle digit in our consumer bank which is pretty big and yes absolutely our corporate investment bank should grow fees much faster that is one of the goals that is one of the reasons that we brought the team we brought in the us because they can help us grow fees on the back of our existing customer relationships so youre going to see cib fees doing as well or maybe a bit better than this year doubledigit for sure and youre going to see a lot of that in the us again so you will see the us as a country both consumer doing better cib doing better the whole of the us going to above doubledigit returns next year but again youre going to see hopefully not hopefully youll see payments also doing very well this year and next year and wealth management doing better next year than this year so that is the reason we are confident that our fees will improve more in banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi this is sofie from jpmorgan so my first question would be on us asset quality if i look at the npl ratio in the us it increased from to coverage fell from to cost of risk in the fourth quarter was basis points if i look at the secondhand car value theyve dropped over in peak value and in addition youre doing more ev financing as far as i can see given the tax rate given that you had hertz dumping ev vehicles in the us i think up to discounts and the secondhand car prices coming down so much and asset quality already showing signs of deterioration how should we think about the cost of risk in the us going forward and if you could just remind us what a normalized cost of risk level is and then my second question would be on the corporate center as far as i can see the first time you make a profit in the corporate center is inside the global financial crisis you also made a positive net interest income in the corporate centers so how should we think about the contribution from the corporate center going forward thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa okay let me take a couple of these highlevel and then ill pass to josé and héctor but in terms of asset quality i want to say weve seen no signs of asset quality deterioration at all we are guiding and were confident that cost of risk will stay around that is probably a throughthecycle number roughly so could be lower could be a bit higher but should be were not seeing really we had said previously through the cycle we have a bit bigger balance sheets in some emerging markets but we havent given this but id say and maybe josé wants to address that but id say around whats important is that and this is not just europe but its mostly europe our balance sheet is very low risk and highly secured in the case of europe a lot of that is mortgages so actually of our total balance sheet is subprime mortgages with very low average ltvs were not anticipating a big change in those numbers maybe a few basis points yes thats why we as you know the basis points is the underlying so we do have some space to grow there but this really is about basis points and the big driver and thats the reason were not seeing any deterioration in our big portfolios is that we had recordlow unemployment and this is the biggest driver of cost of risk in most of our balance sheet so again we are confident the economy will remain resilient if you look at the latest actually todate the imf just upgraded growth especially for spain and some of our key economies and then our consumer portfolios and maybe héctor wants to comment a bit more on the us but yes there will be some normalization but to be honest everything we expected this year has happened in our consumer portfolios brazil is trending down the us is normalizing as we expected there will be some normalization in consumer next year but very much within the expectations of what weve been seeing in the last year ill let héctor answer on that but let me just address the corporate center maybe thats for josé but just to say that its very important that different banks have different policies for the corporate center so in the corporate banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 center for example we place our excess liquidity with ecb then we have transfer pricing and so again you should see some of that and ill let the detail for josé in the context of our commercial business for example in the euro balance sheet in spain and portugal again part of that is lets say more financial and part of that is depending on how you choose and our policy in highlevel terms is to take out some of the volatility and really try to have a more marketbased transfer pricing and so you can see the actual commercial business and so some of those financial benefits of higher rates sometimes in our case as youve seen this year go to the corporate center so maybe you want to take the us maybe orders and then josé you want to also expand on the corporate center héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sure sofie i mean really quickly in the us indiscernible that we have has shown a very robust growth in sales volume are billion its basically helped by the new relationship we have with some new oems that we have included in the portfolio and we have as you know a continued dominance in the subprime used car segment which we are the leaders in the market this volume basically rebounded as you have seen on the back of the new oems agreements that i explained okay and also compensated for some declines from volumes that we had in other oems okay and then you basically see that we have seen a reversion to normal in credit performance with delinquencies and losses increasing seasonally as we have every single year through the last quarter but still below the prepandemic levels okay so we expect the performance to continue through and we see lower world rates of chargeoffs and lower delinquencies driving that of the shift that we have to prime loans and nearprime loans and generally us recovery in the us economy so i wouldnt say recovery but robust us economy new vehicle prices basically continue to be higher than prepandemic period and us prices are falling but they continue to be higher than four years ago and also are being supported by the sort of robust recovery rate that we have remember that i explained last quarter about after days delinquencies were still below prepandemic levels at around i mean compared to above so our outlook for is a positive on the us auto sales growth in both loans and leases and the sustained net income delivery as losses basically stay below the historical term so we dont expect basically cost of risk to deteriorate in the us of that josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa sofie the nii of the corporate center the nii of the corporate center basically comes from the relationship between the corporate center with the balance sheet in spain and there are two different balance sheets in spain one is the commercial balance sheet in spain and we make it like an independent bank so we charge to spain the tlacmrel costs we charge the financing of the alco portfolio and a couple of other things so net commercial spain balance sheet we charge around billion for those items and then we also have a cib balance sheet in spain thats group cib booked in spain plus the branches like an asset we isolate the cib business from interest rate risk so there is an intragroup transfer pricing for the cib business that is in the balance sheet of spain and thats around million so although we remunerate the commercial gaap in spain you see a commercial gaap that is the difference between loans of billion and deposits of billion the difference is billion we remunerate that gaap at the central bank rate but then we charge these items that i explained making spain equivalent to a country and isolating cib against the dti so obviously when banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 rates are up we have at the corporate center higher income from the dti coming from cib as rates will come down that should also come down begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from francisco riquel from alantra equities please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes good morning i want to ask about the capital the rote indiscernible payout ratio but yet the capital built is limited in as per your guidance so i wonder what are the regulatory impacts that we should expect if any or what are the moving parts impacting the capital ratios and second here is the capital target the srep cet1 has been raised by basis points in the last two years to so regulators would also impose further countercyclical buffers so in this context do you think that the capital target postbasel iv is still valid or would you be looking to increase this part over time thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so in terms of capital we are very comfortable with our level of current capital its over not and just very important its over fullyloaded after basel iii so again really important that we are comfortable we have ample buffers in terms of the regulatory requirements the second point is that every year were generating more and more capital organically we are a compounder or were adding to equity and were investing in profitable growth for the future and this is really important so this is allowing us enough capital to grow we have put in place a very ambitious and successful program in terms of rotation of the balance sheet so as you can see the net rwa growth last year was zero but increasing the front book profitability and so again we are aiming to in terms of capital build this year on a likeforlike basis we went from to were now accruing the buyback in december so that means that goes up from and thats after increasing the payout to as you know from so again were generating more and more capital we generated billion of capital this year its much much larger than the last few years we continue to aim as youve seen to grow profitability next year which should increase the capital generation and give us space to both fund our growth increasing returns to shareholders as we make more money and we generate more capital and next year we will have the basel iii but the number that we are projecting for the end of this year is to from the for the end of we expect that number to be exactly the same on day one again by the end of the year and on day one in january the same the final impact in we estimate basis points basis points so that would mean that on january we would be compliant already with a fullyloaded down the road with a that im saying anything else on the requirement you want to say on the p2r and p2g because banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no ph pancho very quickly we will generate between to of organic capital per quarter and we expect to have around basis points of regulatory charges of which basis points will be up i mean frontload in basel iii so thats why by the end of december the ratio that we will publish will be already fully basel iii compliant as ana just explained and the capital ratio of to will be the same on december and on january because we will not have any impact from basel iii on day one that impact will be absorbed in and in terms of the and headroom ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa well were i believe one of the few european banks that under the stress test doesnt breach mda i mean theres not very many the headroom is very comfortable we have hundreds of basis points i never know if weve given this number or not but we have a management buffer that is absolutely more than enough to satisfy our economic our risk appetite and the regulators so we are comfortable with our position and will be even better on a nominal basis which again we dont think that is the only number we should look at but on a nominal basis months from now were going to be in a much better position even than we are today visàvis our peers begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please we are running a little bit out of time so can you make them as specific as possible thank you operator next question from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom first question is on the nii prospect have you been hedging your variable mortgage portfolio to protect the nii trajectory in terms of the geographies can you please update us on your net interest income sensitivity with the forward rates curve and flat deposit remuneration the second is a more conceptual question you hit your guidance and keep on running ahead of consensus on profitability while capital is growing yet consensus estimates are hesitant to meet your guidance and valuation stays undemanding what do you say to the skeptics on santander thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa what i say to the skeptics look and what i tell everybody every time to evaluate something is look at the numbers look at the track record if you look at our track record thats why i showed a slide by the way the nii well answer héctor we will answer that on the hedge but basically its i think we have gotten some recognition this year way we need way way more absolutely we had distributed to shareholders of our market value billion that is five times to shareholders what we gave nine years ago but very importantly banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 on a per share basis as we said this year we are up as we increase the payout cash dividend per share i mean any number you look at is at the group level is i think sorry to say this but impressive but very importantly we see a lot more upside in the next few years so what i would say is just look at the numbers and thats what we are doing look at our track record look at our model look at our diversification i think its going to be and as we are preparing for this call if you look at the group by global business its a much more simple to understand group but very importantly by managing the bank now by five global business we have a lot more upside for many more years and this is the key the market will see this year we are launching our own tech platform in the us this is totally differential for the us of course but also for the group there is and this is really important a plan to deploy as héctor said common business model common operating model and common tech in both our retail bank and our consumer bank so as well you know the numbers your recommendations are higher i think youre still way short by the way of how we see things but thats fine so we are not even half as bullish as we are we own a lot of shares and i think just to answer the last question the market tends to look and this is the feedback we got from a couple of longterm santander investors they look at us through the rearview mirror and if you look at santander through the rearview mirror the first year where we are outperforming our peers on almost every dimension are not all our peers but our goal is to outperform all our peers dont get me wrong is and what they tell us is you need two years of consistency and you will see that i am very confident we will see that héctor and i are working together really well we like what we do we believe in this company we have a great team we just announced yesterday a top hire from a major digital bank in europe to run our openbank platform were going to deploy our national digital platform in the us this year all our customers from our current retail bank in the us will be on the new platform in so just well keep on delivering and well keep on buying shares at roi so im sure this is something which well get to and josé can you answer on the structural hedging josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah andrea indiscernible prospect sensitivity et cetera yeah youre right we had a hedging of our indiscernible mortgages which is basically expired already it will expire in by april it will expire so the sensitivity that were going to have next year its going to be this the actual sensitivity of the portfolio there are two ways of answering your question about future sensitivity one is let me give you the sensitivity to a drop a parallel drop of basis points in spain it would be minus billion all things being equal another way of looking at it is the way you post the question which is if i use forward rate curves with flat cost of deposits meaning that the cost of deposits in will be the same as we had in december which is probably not realistic nii is positive around million okay so we will still have positive repricing next year with cost of deposits remaining flat but again that is not a realistic assumption in our opinion so i give you the minus billion basis points drop plus million with cost of deposits flat begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can i have the next question please operator next question from ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my questions two very quick ones the first one is if you can give us your best approximation of what to expect from argentina in terms of earnings in and the second one if you have charged anything on the motor finance and discussion basically in the uk and if you can give us your view of how that discussion basically can develop and what kind of restructuring charges or impairments actually you might have to face in and on the basis of this thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so argentina our bank in argentina is doing incredibly well obviously the exchange rate has meant a few basis points of effect on our capital and volatility in the quarterly numbers i believe for next year and how we are going to report is going to be leaving argentina in current so you can get a better view of what really is going on so this is really important we report in constant when you look at the performance of the business but will leave argentina in current in terms of the pl its not really material except for this volatility across the from and the effect on capital was a few basis point i think basis points basis points in q4 argentina were not anticipating nothing very different for the next year in terms of the uk its still early days it would not be significant i mean we ph im going to say indiscernible significant we dont really know but it should not be a big number because its not a really big portfolio fca is looking into it so nothing really that right now were concerned about begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi thanks for taking my questions two quick ones hopefully on brazil obviously very strong growth in nii can you maybe talk us through that strong growth i see the cards seen a pickup in growth maybe you can update us where you are in that card growth strategy versus your the run rates youve given us in the past and will the cap on rate on loan rates how will that affect you in and second very quick one can you give us what tax rate youre assuming for your and targets and any color you can give us in particular in brazil in the us how to think about in those two regions thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so let me answer as theres quite a few questions im going to answer very high level and we can then address some of the others in the coming quarters but basically brazil is as youve seen is doing exactly what we predicted in the last few quarters were expecting a much higher profitability in in the highteens actually costs actually growing less in line or even a bit below inflation given the one transformation which is already having effects in brazil we can grow and actually grow our cost base less because were investing together banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 revenue growth net interest income between doubledigit and yeah all doubledigit growth in all the top line and efficiency ratio improving again so very strong performance anticipated for across all the different global businesses but driven by retail and consumer in terms of the tax rate and cards just i dont think anything you want to say about cards all i can say about cards is that we put the brakes on two years ago actually months ago youre seeing that in the cost of risk in the consumer portfolios in brazil coming down were anticipating a lower cost of risk in brazil next year and that is mostly a reflection of the lesser growth in cards we will start to grow again but again the growth in brazil is across all the global businesses not just the retail but also the consumer cib and all the others in terms of the tax rate for josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no i mean just one comment on growth in brazil if you look at the consumer finance which includes everything in brazil this year it was the portfolio together with cib that grew the least just and obviously as rates come down that portfolio should increase next year a bit more than the average so we are expecting more or less very low doubledigit growth in loans in brazil next year this portfolio should grow a little bit more than the average and we would expect corporate loans corporate lending growing a little bit less than the average so that shows the changing mix that we expect for next year that should support margin expansion together with this interest sensitivity that we have to rates ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa yeah on the tax rate i dont know the exact numbers and maybe afterwards you can follow up josé or begoña but there is an effect on the tax rate from the which is actually a business a business line or business quality revenue because of the electric vehicles in the us youre seeing that some of that already in q4 its actually as i say its a business but youre seeing that through the tax line so that maybe we want to give some color on that later on begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from marta sanchez romero from citi please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you very much my first question do you expect positive jaws in the us in and then i guess you are in indiscernible and then second following up on your strategy in the uk youre shrinking youre saying that you are going to be shrinking your loan book and your deposits but you expect good platforms to act with the revenue line over time im struggling to reconcile what the strategy and what the endpoint in the uk is because i think indiscernible banks you got the deposits you give mortgages in a very challenging in a very competitive environment ph so unless you grow money into your uk business youre not going to do anything so what is the plan thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so the answer on the us yes absolutely were expecting positive jaws in the us so we are basically growing the top line in revenues more or less flat fees efficiency ratio improving cost flat to flattish i would say indiscernible is actually a going up in quite a significant way so yes absolutely positive jaws in the us in terms of the uk strategy and let me just very briefly say that theres two countries and these are the uk and the us where our us we call it its in retail because you have current accounts and mortgages but i would say its a much more narrow banking model than we have in portugal spain mexico brazil and that is really the strategy so héctor is working very hard on streamlining that business with the teams making sure they get the benefit of the global platform so we can actually focus on profitability so we are not as you say i think you used the word throwing we never throw capital around with total respect we are superefficient and were focused on profitability not just in the uk but across and we are putting as you can see more capital at work in a more profitable global businesses and the more profitable markets very important this is a very granular work that is actually led by héctor and josé where we were not so much focusing on market share in certain countries and certain businesses as on profitability uk is one of them so again full focus on profitability you can see that in the volumes in the uk and spain for example you can see that in the front book that héctor showed the front book this year is above indiscernible if i remember correctly we are being very disciplined again not just by countries and global businesses even by portfolios and this is something which we intend to remain as focused or even more if possible in the next few years begoña

question please q yeah héctor thanks thanks can you hear me héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yes go ahead please q oh thank you yeah first of all thanks for still disclosing the country reporting which is very useful to us as im listing for that my question relates to the customer growth which was one of the kpis to drive scale effects banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 youve added million customers to million the target is million until to what extent this is depending on the rollout of the fully digital offering and to what extent will that then backlog some of the revenue growth that you expected to see until ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so yes absolutely in our consumer bank especially the deployment of the platforms including indiscernible and europe should drive a much faster more customer growth in the next few years but very important sometimes i mean our definition of customers is net customers so some of our peers get gross customer we get net customers and so again as we improve and héctor mentioned that several times as we improve our service our experience and become the number one bank customer rotation should be less on the retail side we should accelerate the consumer growth but in any case the revenues we are very confident we can deliver those revenues whether and again think that the revenues are coming with the active customers more than total customers so total customers drives revenues but is much more direct correlation between active customers being the number one bank and thats where we are also focusing a lot in the next few years ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea group executive chair executive director banco santander sa so i think theres a few more if you dont mind begoña and the team will address those again thank you all very much i just want to reiterate héctor and i and all the team remain incredibly confident about our continued delivery on our targets and we see an even better for santander thank you very much disclaimer the information herein is based on
