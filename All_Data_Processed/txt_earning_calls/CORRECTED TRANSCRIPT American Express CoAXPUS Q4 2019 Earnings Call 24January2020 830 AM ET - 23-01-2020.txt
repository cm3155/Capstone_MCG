continued the steady consistent performance that weve delivered over the past two years our strong top line growth continued with revenues growing in the quarter this marked our 10th straight quarter of fxadjusted revenue growth at or above once again our revenue growth was broadbased driven by wellbalanced mix of fees spend and lend we added million new proprietary cards in delivered solid billings growth and continued to grow loans while maintaining industryleading credit metrics these results show that our strategy of investing in share scale and relevance is working this strategy is at the heart of our financial model and it gives us confidence that in todays economic environment we can sustain highlevels of revenue growth which is the foundation for steady doubledigit earnings growth american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 my confidence in our ability to generate consistent solid results over the longer term is based on several factors the fundamental strength we derive from our differentiated business model the significant growth opportunities we see across our business and our demonstrated success in executing our investment strategy against the four strategic imperatives i laid out two years ago let me take a few minutes to share some of the highlights of the progress we made on each of these strategic imperatives in we expanded our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing our disciplined strategic approach of refreshing our premium charge products and upgrading our cobrand portfolios globally in all these cases weve added features that our card members value acquisitions remained strong and approximately of our new card members are choosing feebased products which helped to drive growth in subscriptionlike fee revenues for the year our new card members are skewing younger and are more digitally engaged our refreshed products are also enabling us to reengage with our existing customer base where we are seeing increased organic spend alltime high net promoter scores and steady retention in our commercial business weve taken our successful approach to strategic product refreshes and applied it to our business card portfolio in the us and select markets around the world in addition to the refreshes weve expanded our commercial card offerings with the introduction of several new products for business customers of all sizes and to deepen our relationships with our business customers we continued our focus on growing our noncard product offerings by expanding our ap automation solutions as well as offering a variety of lending and flexible payment programs to help our business customers manage cash flow and grow their businesses in total over the past two years weve refreshed and launched over proprietary products across both our commercial and consumer businesses around the world resulting in greater customer engagement and strong new card acquisitions which are driving our revenue growth turning to the network business in we set an ambitious goal of achieving virtual parity coverage in the united states by the end of setting this goal was a recognition of the fundamental importance that our merchant network plays in driving growth across our businesses and it galvanized our organizations focus on achieving it im very pleased to report that as of yearend based on our internal tracking and our understanding of the latest industry data we have achieved virtual parity coverage with approximately of credit card accepting merchants in the us now able to accept the american express card of course we recognize that virtual parity coverage will always be a moving target the merchant landscape is dynamic with hundreds of thousands of us businesses opening and closing every year therefore we will continue to focus on maintaining virtual parity coverage in the us in and beyond were also making good progress to increase coverage across our international markets where our card members live work and travel to the most and this will continue to be a focus for us going forward as we continue to grow our network well work with our merchant partners in the us and around the world to ensure that our card members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their amex cards are accepted finally im also pleased to report that the peoples bank of china officially accepted our network application an important next step in our plan to build a network business in china american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 on the digital front weve been hard at work integrating the acquisitions weve made over the last few years into our mobile app to provide our card members with premium access and experiences across a wide range of travel dining and lifestyle services that differentiate us from our competitors were also working with our partners and our internal development teams to deliver a wide range of new online and mobile features capabilities and services to help our customers manage their life and their business efficiently and securely our goal in these initiatives is to deepen the digital ties we have with our customers so that american express becomes an indispensable part of their lives and were seeing good results as customer engagement with our digital channels are strong and growing today of our active card members are digitally engaged with us via our app and our website and weve seen a increase year over year in the customers who use our mobile app daily those are just some of the highlights of our accomplishments in as ive reported each quarter for the past two years the progress weve made in each of these areas is driving our performance and shows that our financial model and investment strategy has generated sustainable growth thats why well continue this strategic approach and why were confident that we have a long runway for steady growth over the long term with that in mind we expect to deliver revenue growth in of to on an fxadjusted basis and earnings of to looking ahead our business is strong and our focus is clear we have an incredibly talented team at all levels and strong relationships with a wide array of outstanding business partners from our cobrand and digital partners to our millions of merchant partners around the globe all working together to deliver the best products and services for our customers im excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in and beyond and im confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders now let me turn it over to jeff jeffrey c campbell executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here today to talk about the fourth quarter and what was a solid year for american express and to lay out our expectations for ill discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning since it is our yearend call and since looking at our performance on an annual basis is both more in line with how we actually manage the business and also gives us a better sense of the underlying trends turning to our summary financials on slide fourth quarter revenues of billion grew on an fxadjusted basis and full year revenues of billion also grew on an fxadjusted basis this growth as it has been all year continues to be driven by a wellbalanced mix of growth in fee spend and lend revenues and was consistent with the high levels of revenue growth weve delivered for over two years this strong top line performance drove net income of billion for the full year and billion for the fourth quarter in understanding our yearoveryear results i do need to spend a minute on some discrete impacts in our reported results this year and last year as a reminder the fourth quarter of contained of positive adjustments for discrete tax items related to the tax act of and certain tax audits in addition as you remember in the first quarter of this year we had a charge from the resolution of certain merchant litigation if you adjust for these two impacts as we have done on slide full year adjusted eps was american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 up versus the prioryear adjusted eps of including the of eps in the fourth quarter which was up versus the prioryear turning now to the details of our performance ill start with billed business which you see several views of on slides through starting on slide total fxadjusted billed business growth was up in the fourth quarter and for the full year we do think it is important to continue to break out the billings growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we continue to see the impact of exiting our network business in europe and australia due to regulatory changes the of our overall billings that comes from our network business gns was down in the fourth quarter and down for the full year on an fxadjusted basis as a result of the market exits we do expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in the latter part of and return to positive levels of growth our proprietary business which makes up of total billings and drives most of our financial results was up in the fourth quarter and for the full year on an fxadjusted basis turning to slide as we have said throughout the proprietary billed business growth trends are consistent with the economic environment solid growth but slower than the very robust growth we saw in you see this as you turn to slide to look at the billings by customer type for the fourth quarter starting with us consumer which made up of the companys billings in the fourth quarter and remains our largest customer segment billings were up in line from the to growth we have seen all year this growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers these trends also highlight the relative strength of the consumer in the us moving to the right international consumer growth remained in the doubledigits at on an fxadjusted basis despite the mix macroeconomic and geopolitical environment in the fourth quarter we saw growth moderate in mexico and the uk sequentially driven by external factors so growth in the uk remain in the midteens and we continued to see strong growth in the midteens in our top markets across the european union as well as in japan spending from our us small and midsized enterprise card members or smes grew a solid in the fourth quarter in line with the third quarter we continue to feel good about the steady acquisition results were seeing in our us sme customers and importantly as we think about we saw stabilization in this key customer segment in q4 international sme remains our highestgrowing customer type with fxadjusted billings growth in the fourth quarter we feel great about the strong growth we saw throughout coming off of even higher levels of growth in given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products we continue to believe we have a long runway to sustain strong growth going forward and then for the relatively small part of our volumes this quarter that come from large and global corporate card billings we saw a decline of on the fourth quarter on an fxadjusted basis similar to what we saw last quarter as weve said for years now this is not a growth segment for us but it is an important part of our merchant value development finally on the far right global network services was down on an fxadjusted basis driven by the market exits that i mentioned earlier and if you were to adjust for those impacts the remaining portion of gns was up on an fxadjusted basis in line with q3 overall we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 turning now to loan performance on slide total loan growth was in the fourth quarter with about of our growth for the year coming from our existing customers we continue to focus on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers borrowing at the same time as weve been saying all year we have increased our investments in premium products and that shift in portfolio mix coupled with some steady tightening we have done on the risk management side over the past several years has led to lower loan growth the shift towards more premium products has also led to lower loan balances on promotional offers which along with continued positive impacts from pricing for risk contributed to the basis point yearoveryear increase in net interest yield in the fourth quarter if you see on the righthand side of slide so the combination of loan growth and yield increase has drove the growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter ultimately we are focused on driving profitable revenue growth as the financial outcome of our lending strategy and so we are pleased with the stability in net interest income growth that we saw in turning next to the credit metrics on slide if you were to take an average for the year to smooth out the quarterly volatility lending writeoff rates were up basis points and charge rates were up basis points on average for the full year this level of modest writeoff rate increases in a bau environment is consistent with the expectations we have talked about for several years now and as you can see on the bottom of the slide delinquency rates have been relatively stable all year and the gcp loss ratio continued to actually be down year overyear these trends reflect both the credit implications of our strategy as well as the relatively stable economy and low unemployment rate we continue to expect modest increases in our loss rates in consistent with the trends weve now seen for several years importantly we still do not see anything in our portfolios that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment both on the consumer and commercial side in fact all of these portfolios performed much better in than we expected at the beginning of the year this brings us to provision expense which grew in the fourth quarter and for the full year the business decisions weve made to shift more towards premium products along with tightening things a bit on the risk management side both contributed to the loan growth credit metrics and provision trends we saw in moving forward while there may be some variability in the monthly trends we expect relatively steady loan growth in and as i mentioned a few moments ago from a credit perspective we expect the kind of modest increases in loss rates yearoveryear that weve been seeing to continue as a result of these dynamics we do expect higher provision expense growth in than we saw in while were on the subject of provision yes let me touch on cecl as you know the cecl accounting changes went into effect on january for us as well as the rest of the industry in our first quarter results well report the implementation or day impact which we estimate will increase credit reserves by about billion the increase will run net of tax through equity with no impact to earnings i would remind you that a unique aspect of american express is our charge card portfolio so although our card and other lending reserves will go up by approximately billion we will have an offset from the approximately billion decrease in charge reserves given the short life of those receivables now as a reminder this increase will not have a material impact on our capital ratios or our ability to return capital to shareholders given our 30plus return on equity in the multiyear phaseinperiod for regulatory capital purposes american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 then we get to the ongoing or as some would say the day impact of accounting for cecl and our ongoing provision expense starting in the first quarter of under our current outlook we expect a relatively modest increase to our annual provision expense from the implementation of cecl more significantly i do expect that there will be more quartertoquarter volatility under cecl compared to the previous methodology though some of this volatility should net out over the course of the year making our longstanding focus on annual results rather than quarterly results even more pronounced in now lets get back to our results and turn to revenues on slide fxadjusted revenue growth was in the fourth quarter and for the full year the focused execution of our strategy has delivered strong top line revenue growth of or more for the last quarters on an fxadjusted basis this consistent revenue performance has occurred in both the robust economic environment of and the somewhat slower growth environment of and continues to be supported by a wellbalanced mix of growth in fee spend and lend revenues as you see on slide net card fees remained the fastest growing revenue line up for the full year and accelerating to in the fourth quarter we are really pleased by the confidence that our customers place in our value propositions when they choose to pay these subscriptionlike fees and we continue to see that the majority of our new card members around are choosing our feebased products as well supported by the continued execution of our product refreshment strategy and our focus on premium value propositions we expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest growing revenue line in we are confident in our ability to maintain strong card fee growth given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and customer segments as well as the high levels of engagement we see with new and existing card members these high levels of engagement supported by the progress weve made around coverage continue to drive steady growth in our largest and most important revenue line discount revenue which was up for the full year and in the fourth quarter broadly in line with billings and net interest income grew at for the full year and in the fourth quarter driven by the growth in loans and net yield that i mentioned a few moments ago looking ahead i expect net interest income growth to continue to be a bit higher than loan growth driven by continued benefits from pricing and mix as well as a modest tailwind from rate cuts importantly the portion of our revenue coming from fee and spend revenues remained at for the full year and the fourth quarter in line with history and we expect that revenue composition to continue given our differentiated spend and fee centric model moving on to expenses on slide overall expenses grew in the fourth quarter and for the full year there are three important items impacting the quarter here that more or less offset but are important to understand first there were a few positive income tax and other taxrelated developments in the quarter that show up in the low effective tax rate as well as in the operating expense line we then as we often do took the opportunity to reinvest the upside we saw relative to our original plans to do two important things for the longterm health of the business first we accelerated the funding of some incremental business growth initiatives similar to what we did in last years fourth quarter and second we accelerated some of the things we were doing to evolve our organization for the future and improve operating efficiencies and as a result we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter which is included in the salary and benefits line in the tables that accompany our earnings release as i mentioned before the impact of these three items roughly offset american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 one another and you see the impacts across opex marketing and business development and the lower effective tax rate at the bottom of the page looking at the full year our opex growth of was also impacted by the litigationrelated charge we took in the first quarter of that i mentioned earlier in my remarks and as ive said previously some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth growth in sales force growth in premium servicing and enhancements in digital capabilities caused us in to see more growth in operating expenses than we have seen in recent years or importantly than we expect to see going forward we have a long track record of generating operating expense leverage by growing opex more slowly than revenues and going forward we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so turning now to slide to look at the trend in customer engagement expenses overall customer engagement expenses for the full year grew as a result of our investment strategy starting at the bottom marketing and business development costs were up for the full year due to our continued focus on funding growth initiatives and in part the incremental impact of the 11year extension of our longstanding partnership with delta that we signed earlier this year moving on to rewards expense you can see that it grew and was broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth for the full year and as we continue to evolve our value propositions and see high engagement with our premium benefits card member services grew for the full year while there were some adjustments that caused slower growth in card member services in the fourth quarter we continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our feebased products going forward we continue to expect total customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues as we continue to invest in share scale and relevance turning to capital on slide we ended the year with a cet1 ratio of which is near the top of our to target range during the year we increased our dividend by and returned billion of capital to our shareholders this outcome is a testament to the 30plus return on equity that our financial model generates as well as our focus on maintaining capital strength while consistently returning excess capital to our shareholders as weve said our primary focus is on maintaining our cet1 ratio within our to target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans and we do not believe that cecl will have a material impact on those plans to sum up we feel really good about our steady and consistent performance throughout looking ahead we see a long runway to sustain high levels of revenue growth and doubledigit eps growth in todays economic environment that brings me to our outlook for and then well open the call for your questions our guidance for is consistent with our financial growth algorithm as steve mentioned at the start of our call we are introducing our earnings per share guidance at a range of to our guidance does assume an economy that looks somewhat similar to and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment consistent with the performance weve been delivering for over twoyears this guidance includes revenue growth of to on an fxadjusted basis and at current exchange rates wed expect a more modest headwind from fx in our reported growth than we saw in and as i mentioned earlier we will continue to invest to drive those highlevels of revenue growth and so we expect customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues again in american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 and we are committed to generating operating expense leverage by growing our opex at a slower pace than revenues and slower than the pace we saw in looking at the drivers of our financial results there were a few other key planning assumptions id highlight as i mentioned earlier we expect the provision growth to be higher in than it was in including a relatively modest increase from cecl we do expect cecl to drive more volatility quartertoquarter and so focusing on the fullyear results will be even more critical in in addition we expect that our effective tax rate will be around next year in summary we remained focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in todays environment doubledigit eps growth as i look at our performance over the past two years and our expectations for they clearly demonstrate consistent execution against our strategy as well as our financial growth algorithm with that ill turn the call back over to rosie rosie c perez senior vice president head of investor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa ill ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thanks for your cooperation and with that operator well now open up the line for questions operator question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc good to see the solid guide for jeff want to confirm does the eps guidance include the negative impact of cecl jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co yes absolutely so when you think about the range weve provided this year don i would say the normal thing of you have to think about a little stronger economy pushes us towards the higherend a little weaker economy which is why a lowerend range is there and cecl is the other uncertainty but absolutely we are contemplating what i call the relatively modest impact of cecl in there so you should go with that as full gaap guidance donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc and are you in your guidance i mean i assume were sort of at the trough of billed business here as youre lapping some tougher comps do you have an acceleration built in and could you talk about the discount rate indiscernible knowing that youre sort of willing to scale that up and down jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 i think what i would actually point you to is the remarks steve started with weve had straight quarters now don of revenue growth which is ultimately what were focused on in the to range and the fourth quarter was another strong quarter of revenue growth so actually when we look at that metric which ultimately is the end goal of the mixture of everything were doing with card fees with pricing loan growth billings with the discount rate we actually see a lot of stability in the momentum that were entering in terms of revenue growth stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i think the other point is that if you look over these quarters weve shown that there is an elasticity to our billed business that still continues to drive the high revenue growth and so given the high card fees the higher growth in card fees the consistent performance weve had from a net interest income perspective billings can fluctuate up and down the other thing i would point out is not all billings are created equally so we feel really comfortable with where we woundup and how we enter the year from a billings perspective operator next question is from mark devries with barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks steve i have a question for you just on what inning you guys are in in this kind of productlaunch and refresh cycle im assuming given youve done already that its pretty late innings and the reason im asking is as you pointed out its been a big contributor to adding new customers reengaging with existing ones and presumably been really helpful in generating that strong revenue growth and if we are in kind of later innings what are you looking to as kind of the levers to continue to sustain that revenue growth stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah the interesting thing is i wouldnt equate this to innings i would equate this to baseball seasons because the way youve got to think about this is that product refreshes can happen on a threetofouryear basis and so we get to play season all over again and so you look at refreshes over the last two years there are still more to do within the existing portfolio and by the time you get done guess what some of your products are three and four years old now so i wouldnt think about this as a onetime thing and i think you have to think about this as continuous refreshment because look the reality is our customer base constantly changes were looking to appeal to new customers at all aspects if you look at platinum before we did the refresh platinum was not as attractive to millennials as it is today and if you look at the value and the benefits that we put on it its become a much more attractive product and most of our growth has come from millennial uptake look we have since the refresh we have more platinum cards than we did prior to that refresh and over of the new cards acquired to millennials so i wouldnt think about this as an innings game i think about this as we constantly play the baseball season and theres going to be another season and another season and another season its just going to be different its going to be different card products and when you look at our portfolio of card products its in the hundreds so we have a ways to go operator next we go to betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 hi i was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the network opportunities outside the us i know you mentioned steve that youve essentially achieved parity in the us now and maybe if you could give us a sense because i know that was a threeyear outlook that you gave i think last year and where are we there and should we expect acceleration thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so look from an outside of the us perspective obviously were nowhere near where we are in the us we identified a strategy that we wanted to increase overall coverage internationally by over a threeyear period we talked about that at investor day i say without giving specific metrics on this weve made progress we expect to hit that growth target over that threeyear period its a very focused strategy in that were looking at key cities were looking at the key cities that our card members travel to and that we have large card bases in and were also working with our network partners in markets that we do not have proprietary businesses to continue to grow that and lets not forget our efforts in china our license has been accepted were waiting for the final approval and hopefully sometime this year we will launch the network and that will increase not only coverage in china but what itll do is itll put more cards on the network as we engage with the chinese banks to have more chinese travelers as they go into and the reality is they are going to go into a lot of our european and asian cities which is going to put more demand and will actually then help drive more coverage so were still committed to it and we continue to invest in it and the other point i would make out is the us is not done from a us perspective as i said in my remarks it is a moving piece and so what we need to do is to continue to sign those merchants that come into business and what we also need to do is to continue our efforts to have warm acceptance and from a warm acceptance perspective what we mean is decals on the doors we put up over million decals this year just in the united states alone and its an education process as well its an education process for the merchants and its an education process for our card members that in fact the card is accepted so what weve laid what we would call technical acceptance theres some more work to be done from a warm acceptance perspective and our card members realizing now that the coverage is there so youll see a lot of work in those areas as well operator next we go to bob napoli with william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc good morning thank you steve jeff and rosie appreciate it just your competitors have been making some significant acquisitions visa acquiring plaid mastercard several acquisitions i mean paypal buying honey american express has done some interesting tuckin acquisitions but first of all is there any concern about some of the acquisitions from a competitive perspective like a visa plaid and is amex it seems like there are so many opportunities to leverage your brand and your network with all of this innovation in the fintech and software space is there areas that you would like to leverage or invest more into whether its security or other areas stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 look i mean were not going to get into obviously specific acquisitions but what youve seen our focus over the last sort of months has really been from some of our digital capabilities whether that be mezi or resy or cake and obviously loungebuddy and we did acompay and so what were trying to do is buildout the organic footprint that we have with our existing card members were trying to engage with them more digitally and look i think that our competitors visa mastercard paypal paypal is really a partner more than a competitor when you look at what theyre doing theyre doing things that are smart for them theyre run by really smart people and theyve got their strategies and their main focus is connectivity and bringing more and more and different types of transactions across those rails and i think that the acquisitions that theyve done to buildout from a network perspective are smart acquisitions for them when we look at what were trying to do from a card member to merchant perspective we feel really comfortable with what weve done and i think just looking at the plaid acquisition which i think is a good acquisition by visa it allows them to provide connectivity from their bank partners into fintechs in fact we use plaid today we have an investment in plaid and well make a little bit on that as well and so thats a more sensible acquisition for them than it would be for us not only from an economic perspective but certainly from a strategic perspective and i think just a customer perspective so we look at everything we have our own target list of things that we want to do and things that quite honestly just dont make sense for us where were positioned with our model operator next we go to moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and you guys highlighted being with between that and revenue growth kind of for a long string of quarters and pretty much right in the middle of that over the course of as you look into you talked a little bit maybe of a little bit of a slowdown on net interest income are there any other things that youd be looking at to accelerate from where they were here jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well moshe yes we look at the stability weve seen overall in revenue growth quarters at to and see tremendous momentum to continue to meet that same target in when you look at acceleration i would actually point you to card fee growth so card fee growth has been our fastest growing revenue line it actually accelerated in q4 and for all of the reasons steve described were pretty bullish in our ability to keep that as our fastest growing revenue line i also point out to everyone that of course you have a large because of the way we give you accounting for this as you would know moshe we have a large portion of next years card fees sitting on the balance sheet waiting to be amortized so we feel really good about that line and net interest income i would point out actually has been very steady sequentially moshe because while our booked loan growth rate has moderated a little bit part of that is just us being a little bit tighter about things like promotion offers and thats why your yield is going up and net interest income growth has actually been pretty flat so gosh we would look at the revenue guidance and say its a continuation of what weve been putting up for about two and a half years and we feel pretty good about the stability we see in the economy the stability we see in our credit performance and the tremendous strength frankly of the us consumer american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 operator next we go to a question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning it sounds like the guidance ranges are more related to execution than anything else but last year jeff you guys had talked about a scenario where there was macroeconomic weakness to the extent that there was any weakness how should we think about this guidance especially on the eps side thanks jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well look i think the results we posted sanjay in demonstrate that weve got a model that produced steady results in the really robust economic environment of and continued to produce those same results in the more modest growth environment of so there is clearly a range of economic outcomes around where we are where our model is flexible enough or resistant enough to change ill go back to the card fee point i just made to moshe where our card fee growth is actually pretty resilient in different economic environments so we feel good about our guidance across any reasonable range of economic outcomes that anyone is forecasting right now now if theres a sudden dramatic shift upwards or downwards thats the kind of thing that it would take to probably cause us to move off that range operator next we go to jason kupferberg with bank of america please go ahead jason kupferberg q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thanks guys good morning so i just wanted to start on the enterprise commercial side i know its still only of billings but i think last quarter we were expecting maybe a little bit of an uptick we got instead a little bit of a downtick there on a constantcurrency basis so i was just wondering i know last quarter you had a couple of specific customers that were callouts as driving some of the softness were those continuing to be headwinds in q4 was there more of a malaise in corporate te do you still think we get back to call it low single digit in and then just on a quick side note can you size that restructuring charge for us in the quarter thank you jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co so let me quickly do the facts on the two and then steve will probably add a little bit of color on the large and global i guess we look at it and we say sequentially its about the same as it was last quarter yes you do have the same two large customers where there are some things unique to those customers going on but look weve said for a long time this isnt a growth segment for us these are big companies doing te its an important part of the franchise so were not frankly particularly overly focused on that rate were focused on other parts of commercial on the restructuring charge the point i would make to everyone is this is just an example of what weve done for many many years which is we had some very good developments on the tax side we used that to accelerate some spending around a range of growth initiatives you see some of that in the marketing line some of that in some of the other customer engagement lines and yes we did take a restructuring charge its a little bit more than million look weve been growing expenses weve added over colleagues in the last year we will continue to grow expenses in frankly were going to continue net to add colleagues but weve got to american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 make sure we have the right people in the right place so that we can continue as we have for many many years to scale our company as we grow our volumes stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co and sorry as far as restructuring i think jeff hit all that look i think with the large and global from a company perspective not a lot of companies are looking to grow their te so you dont have the organic growth that you would have and then you have a couple of companies that pull back or you have a loss here or there and you feel that in the numbers but it is of the overall billings but from a profit perspective its a lot less than that this is an important part of our business from a network perspective and it allows us to utilize our scale and infrastructure to really support our middlemarket business and our small business and so it plays an important role and i think where we are from a perspective of overall billings were comfortable with it would be great if it would grow but if it grows its not going to make that much of a difference from a profitability perspective which gets back to my point about not all billings are created equally some billings have a lot more profitability than others and so i think youll probably see this sort of flatness continue as we move into next year and its something that were doing in our own company as well i mean were not looking to grow our te expenses i dont sit around with my staff and say lets see how we can grow more te i wouldnt mind sitting around with a lot of my customers staffs and saying that but we dont do that and i think companies are doing that and youre looking at te and looking at some more video conferencing and things like that and reducing some of the travel and you see that in the numbers operator next we go to rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning look given the maturity of the business and its really impressive to see your us consumer business which is a third of your business growing at the rate that it is im curious to sort of understand what you think is driving that is there an increase in discretionary spending among your legacy customers or when you cite particularly the growth of millennials in the portfolio is it a ramp in their spending stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co rick the interesting thing about our business is its probably not mature yet and i think one of the reasons after the financial crisis everybody jumped into this business especially the banks in a big way is because this is a business that just continues to grow when you look at the consumer business in the united states its sort of and youll see that continuing and i think when we look at our business and from maturity perspective look its a mix of new customers its a mix of what we would call samestore sales if youre thinking about this from a retail perspective its a mix of organic spending as well but were bringing in new customers to the franchise and our brand is playing a lot more with millennials which is over half of our customers that were acquiring at this particular point in time and the reach that were getting with some of our cobrand partners is getting us new customers as well american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 so i dont really look at this business as really mature i look at this business as having and im not just talking about our business im talking about the card business in general i think about this as a business that still has a lot of legs and a lot of growth and you see a lot of the technological changes whether its sort of tapandgo and making it easy to buy online and so forth i mean just with contactless youre going to see more and more smaller dollar transactions coming on to card products whether that be vending machine transactions which is the next thing thats going to happen youre seeing this with transit obviously now in new york city you can use tapand go through the new york city transit system so we dont really look at this as a mature business at all and we think theres expansion opportunities for us not only with new customers but also with our existing customers as we have less than half their shareofwallet and we have as we said for a long time we only have about of their share of lending so we think theres still a lot of upside in this business operator next we go to david togut with evercore isi please go ahead david mark togut q analyst evercore isi thank you good morning international consumer and international sme continue to be your fastest growth businesses and in particular youve called out strength in the uk and the european continent given the regulatory changes with payment services directive to in europe and uk visa and mastercard have both acquired fast ach rails both to address psd2 consumer ach payments and also to complement their b2b payment capability so my question really is does fast ach need to play a role in american express future and if so where would you have an interest geographically potentially to acquire fast ach rails stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so a couple things number one i think from a consumer perspective we see this sort of fast payments we see as really looking to cannibalize some debit looking to cannibalize some ach some check and things like that so from a consumer perspective we have an open banking test right now from a consumer perspective ourselves where were offering some of our noncustomers the ability to payout of their bank accounts so that could be an opportunity for us but i dont see that really impacting credit and charge growth look i think whats interesting for fast payments ach from a b2b perspective and i said this multiple times on calls like this and in meetings they will play a role in b2b payments and it will play a role in procurement spending as well the reality is that we believe we can achieve the same things with the network that we have today and the connectivity that we have as we have the flexibility in pricing look im not constrained by interchange i could price from a transaction perspective and one of the advantages we do have in europe in particular is were a threeparty system were not a fourparty system and so the relationships that we have with card members and merchants with that direct connectivity we believe we can accomplish the same things without acquiring either a vocalink or earthport or something like that but make no mistake it will play a role in procurement the other thing that ive said on these calls before is from a procurement perspective fast ach is really not sort of the beall endall given that most of these payments occur in to days the bigger opportunity is really integrating the payment process within the procurement process and marrying the procuretopay and that takes a long long time and thats why you do partnerships with people like sap and people like ariba to try and integrate the payment in look from my perspective and were on procurement here as well companies are much more focused on how you merge the two than sort of paying their vendor in minutes the last thing i want to do is really pay a vendor in minutes but what i really want to do is integrate the two together so i think theres a place for these acquisitions again for visa and mastercard it goes back i think a little bit to the american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 plaid acquisition but i think we can accomplish the same thing with the capabilities that we have at the current moment operator next we go to james friedman with susquehanna please go ahead james e friedman q analyst susquehanna financial group lllp hi thanks for taking my questions so steve i did and in followup to the previous question and the previous before that i did want to ask about that large and global corporate again and i know its a little like playing twister but im looking at the appendix in terms of the volumes from te and the te actually grew so that seems pretty good and consistent with the way that its been but i realize not all te lands in large and corporate i assume some of thats in so anyway any context about how the te grow but the large and corporate was down stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah well think about our consumer travel business and think about just think about the expansion that weve had in small business international and the expansion that weve had in consumer international and when you think about small business international its not as mature as small businesses in the united states and so if you go back in history what happened from a small business perspective in the united states that started as a te card and now has morphed much more into a b2b card and so the mix of volume that we have and the reality is when you think about sort of the te aspects as it relates outside the us small business international that we have theres a higher percentage of te that occurs on that card because thats the first thing that small businesses will put on internationally and then obviously our consumer business is growing in leaps and bounds internationally and again that has a much more te focus than it does retail focus jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co the only math point i would add is in our tables that stat is the us stat but it just goes to the point that the large and global segment is a small part of our total billings so the te trends get dwarfed in terms of the global company by what consumers and small business are doing operator next we go to a question from chris donat with piper sandler please go ahead christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co good morning thanks for taking my question steve i want to ask a longerterm history question about your card fee strategy because when you go back a few years there really wasnt that much growth or low singledigit growth in card fees and im wondering if your view is whats changed more amexs approach or more the consumer appetite for feebased cards stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no its been our approach that has changed and which is why if you go back for the last couple of years we have started to refresh products we were not in the business of refreshing products if you do not refresh a product it is really hard to increase the fee adding value enables you to increase the fee if youre not adding american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 value you cant do that we had a fundamental shift in sort of how weve approached the business over the last few years youve seen a lot more focus on coverage youve seen a lot more focus on a focused international strategy and youve also seen a major focus on card refreshment and card refreshment remember is its not just about fees its to get people to spend which then gets people to revolve that spend so it really is more about engagement and the fees come along as you add value operator our final question will come from craig maurer with autonomous research please go ahead craig maurer q analyst autonomous research yeah thanks for squeezing me in i wanted to get a little clarity on your thoughts for billed business growth trends in with comps getting easier and were starting to lap some of the issues in corporate and certainly gns could we see an inflection point in where billed business growth starts to reaccelerate and just a housekeeping item are there going to be any unique quarterly trends in marketing spend this year due to the olympics thanks jeffrey c campbell a executive vice presidentfinance executive vice president chief financial officer american express co well i think the short answer on the second one craig is no obviously the olympics is an important event from a lot of perspectives and we have a fabulous franchise in japan and its benefiting from the prime ministers incentives that hes providing in the country to encourage more card use all good stuff for us but not big enough for you to see in our global results on the inflection point on billed business id really go back craig to the theme steve and i have both talked a lot about over the last hour which is our revenue momentum has been very stable for quarters and thats because of the breadth of sources its because of the way were focused on being thoughtful about things like card fees which steve just touched on or how were pricing for risk in our lending portfolio and so we feel good about the trends on billed business but more importantly were focused on the trends and stability on revenue that make us very comfortable with the guidance weve provided for another year of to revenue growth and it is not counting on a big inflection upwards on billed business if that happens great but that is not a planning assumption if you will that underlies the guidance weve provided rosie c perez senior vice president head of investor relations american express co with that well bring the call to an end thank you steve thank you jeff thank you again for joining the call and for your continued interest in american express
