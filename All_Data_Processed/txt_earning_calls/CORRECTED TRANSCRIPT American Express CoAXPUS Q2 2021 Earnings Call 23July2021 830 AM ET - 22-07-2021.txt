turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian and hello everyone welcome to our second quarter earnings call earlier today we reported second quarter revenues of billion and earnings per share of these results reflect an acceleration of the momentum weve seen in our core business and a strengthening macro environment our improving performance is a clear indication that the steps weve taken to manage the company through the pandemic and our investments to rebuild growth momentum are paying off were particularly pleased with the progress were seeing in several key areas including engaging and retaining our existing customers acquiring new customers continued excellent credit performance and an acceleration in spending since the onset of the pandemic weve been investing in shortterm value enhancements to several of our premium products which has helped drive card member engagement and contributed to retention levels that remain higher than the last few years weve also ramped up our acquisition engine over the past several quarters and were really pleased to see that overall acquisitions of proprietary cards which include our co brands have continued to increase with million new cards acquired in the quarter in fact demand for our premium feebased products accelerated this quarter with acquisitions of us consumer and small business platinum and gold cards well above levels and exceeding prior quarters contributing to the continued doubledigit growth in net card fees early spending on these new accounts is strong american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 were also pleased to see that acquisitions are increasing in many of our cobrand portfolios for example as ed bastian mentioned on deltas earnings call last week delta cobrand acquisitions reached of levels in q2 turning to credit we continue to see excellent credit performance with both delinquency and writeoff rates improving further and reaching near historic lows in the quarter were also seeing continued improvements in card member spending spending recovery accelerated in q2 with overall billed business volumes growing in the quarter on an fxadjusted basis versus last year and exceeding prepandemic levels in june goods and services volumes continue to strengthen increasing globally on an fxadjusted basis versus q2 travel and entertainment spending also accelerated in the quarter particularly in the us where a growing percentage of the population is now fully vaccinated in fact we saw a surge in spending by us consumer card members across all te categories with overall us consumer te spending reaching of prepandemic levels in june and continuing to grow into july te spending outside the us continues to recover more slowly due to lower overall vaccination rates and governmentimposed restrictions in some geographies in our consumer business the largest contributor to spending growth in goods and services came from millennial and gen z customers and they are also leading the recovery in te spending with total spending up over on an fxadjusted basis versus levels in q2 for this age cohort in our commercial business overall small and midsized enterprise volumes exceeded prepandemic levels in q2 driven by continued strong growth globally in b2b spending on goods and services which was up on an fxadjusted basis versus while the te recovery also accelerated with the fastest total growth coming from smallersized businesses in the us were also seeing solid spending growth in key travelrelated cobrand portfolios volumes on both delta and hilton cobrand cards increased by double digits versus prepandemic levels in the quarter driven by the same trends of continued strong growth in goods and services spending and an acceleration in the recovery of te spending in addition to investing in retention and acquisition activities as a customerfocused company led by innovation a key part of our investment strategy is geared towards delivering a continuous stream of differentiated products services and capabilities that provide additional value to our current customers and attract new ones to the franchise we invest in innovation in a number of ways through internal development acquisitions cobrand relationships and partnerships with both digital startups and large wellknown brands across a range of industries a great example of our approach to innovation is our strategy for regularly refreshing our unique value propositions by leveraging our digital ecosystem and our diverse network of partners on july we marked the restart of this strategy with the launch of our new enhanced platinum card for consumers in the us the american express platinum card created the premium card category nearly years ago and has continued to define the category ever since we intend to make sure it remains the competitive standard for many years to come the reason for platinums success over the years i believe is twofold first is our continual focus on knowing our customers and delivering value that meets their evolving needs and preferences and second is our willingness to change our value propositions even as our products are at the peak of their performance and thats the case with our most recent refresh despite just coming off our best quarter ever for us platinum account acquisitions we introduced our new us consumer platinum card featuring a broader set of lifestyle benefits while doublingdown on travelrelated benefits the new benefits are enabled by working with an expanded range of partners as well as the continued integration of our growing portfolio of digital assets such as resy and loungebuddy i would note that the last time we refreshed our us platinum card we doubled the customer base bringing in a larger number of younger american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 card members and our intent with our current refresh is to attract an even broader pool of customers to the franchise in developing the new platinum card we listened to our card members and gleaned insights from their spending behavior to determine what features and benefits would be most relevant for the way they live now for example some of the spending patterns on certain everyday goods and services categories that emerged during the pandemic such as streaming services and personal fitness have continued into the recovery this led us to add a series of annual credits for digital entertainment services and equinox club memberships or digital subscriptions to their ondemand app our platinum card members have always cared a lot about travel and entertainment and as our recent quarterly results demonstrate our usbased customers are eagerly returning to travel and in person dining so we added a series of new travelrelated benefits to the refreshed product on top of those platinum card already offers including a significant expansion of our proprietary centurion lounge network and a new global dining access program powered by resy our online reservation platform that provides exclusive access to some of the worlds best restaurants and premium dining experiences the enhancements weve made to the us platinum card represent a significant increase in value which we believe will be very attractive to both current and new customers even with an increase in its annual fee as we have seen from previous refreshes customers are willing to pay more for what they see as platinums unique value and we believe it will be no different in this case in fact the very early indications are encouraging applications and acquisitions have outpaced our expectations in the first two weeks since the new platinum card became available the us platinum refresh is just one example of how were leveraging partnerships in our digital ecosystem to innovate and add differentiated value to our products and services well be refreshing other products and rolling out new digital capabilities for both consumer and commercial customers throughout the remainder of the year and beyond were really excited about the new us platinum card and the potential that it and other innovations we have in the pipeline represent and there are many other reasons why i feel very good about where we are at the halfway point in the year including the progress were making to rebuild momentum in our core business is accelerating and better than we expected at the beginning of the year the improvements were seeing across many of our key metrics are a sign that our strategy for managing through the pandemic and investing in activities to rebuild our growth momentum is working were particularly pleased with the strength were seeing in customer retention new account acquisitions credit performance and overall spending volumes with goods and services volumes now well above prepandemic levels globally and travel and entertainment spending recovering faster than we expected driven by significant improvement in the united states taking all of these factors together were increasingly optimistic that the strength that weve seen in our core business through the first half will continue particularly in the us even as the pace of recovery remains uneven in different regions around the world with this in mind we remain committed to executing our investment strategy for growing our business over the longterm and based on current trends were confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of eps expectations we had for in and to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond now ill turn it over to jeff who will discuss our second quarter results in detail and then well take your questions thank you jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 well thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here today to talk about our second quarter results which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our financial objectives starting with our summary financials on slide second quarter revenues of billion were up yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis as we lapped the trough of the billings and revenue declines that occurred during the most significant pandemic lockdowns in q2 of last year our second quarter net income was billion and earnings per share was these strong results were of course in part driven by an million credit reserve release as we saw continued strong credit performance and some improvements in the macroeconomic outlook now as i turn to a more detailed look at our results ill again focus on what we see as the key drivers of our great progress towards our financial objectives volumes credit trends and the marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum as weve said all year itself is a transition year positioning us for and beyond so lets now get into the first key driver to watch as we measure our progress this year volumes which you will see several views of on slides through you will note that we have shown second quarter volume trends on both a yearoveryear basis and relative to as we find this provides a clearer picture of how spending is recovering on the way to our financial objectives and that clear picture on slide shows an acceleration in the pace of recovery across all of our volumes in the second quarter with total network volumes and billed business volumes up around yearoveryear as we lapped the trough of the billings declines from q2 importantly relative to total network volumes billed business and processed volumes were all down just on an fxadjusted basis and surpassed precovid levels for the month of june the acceleration in billed business is being driven by both spending on goods and services which was up versus as you can see on slide and by a notable improvement in spending on travel and entertainment in the second quarter overall te spending reached nearly of levels as we exited q2 this is a level we originally expected we would not reach until the fourth quarter of this year so to see it recovering more quickly than we had expected and without it coming at the cost of any slowing in the growth in goods and services spending is a positive indicator for us turning to slide you do see that the billed business volume recovery is being led by the us which surpassed levels and was up in the quarter the recovery in total billed business volumes outside of the us is weaker interestingly though you see on the top right of slide that the growth in goods and services spending has been strong in both the us and outside of the us overall spend is weaker outside the us because historically we have more travelrelated spending in our international regions and international te is recovering more slowly due to lower vaccination rates and continued government restrictions in certain geographies focusing in then on just our consumer business on slide you see that overall spending was above levels in the quarter as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to versus and we continue to see strong online and cardnotpresent spend growth demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes weve seen during the pandemic even as offline spending recovered to prepandemic levels in our commercial business as you can see on slide global sme spending which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spend up versus for the quarter this performance was supported by continued growth in b2b spending on goods and services which was up versus in contrast on slide large and global corporate card spending which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment continued to show fewer signs of recovery we have said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 finally putting all customer types te spending together on slide you do see improvement across the board in the second quarter with total te spending reaching nearly of levels in the month of june as i said earlier this recovery has been faster than we expected led by a sharp recovery in us consumer te spending which reached of prepandemic levels in june and has continued to grow in july looking ahead we now assume that overall te spending globally will have recovered to around of levels by the fourth quarter of we also expect continued steady growth in goods and services spending for the remaining so all in all a really good story on spending volumes moving to our other volume metric receivable and loan balances on slide youll see a slightly different set of charts here and in a few other places throughout this presentation where we thought it would be helpful to show comparisons for the first and second quarter relative to both and to help you better technical difficulty the recovery loan balances began to slowly recover in the second quarter and were up sequentially and yearoveryear relative to though loan balances remain down more than spending volumes we continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates which is also driving the very strong credit performance ill talk about in a moment looking forward i would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes this leads then to the second key driver to watch this year credit and provision on slides through as you flip through these slides there are a few key points id like you to take away most importantly we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows although we would expect loss rates to slowly return to more normal levels eventually given how low delinquency rates are today we dont expect to see a material increase in writeoff rates anytime this year this strong credit performance combined with some improvement in our macroeconomic outlook drove a million provision expense benefit in the second quarter as the low writeoffs were fully offset by the reserve release as shown on slide that said the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still billion higher than they were pre pandemic as you can see on slide we are closely monitoring how the card members exiting our financial relief programs are performing and early performance of recent exits has looked quite strong but we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off and there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment around the world including in the us so we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves as you see on slide we ended the second quarter with billion of reserves representing of loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively moving on to our third key driver marketing investments to build longterm growth momentum on slide we invested billion in marketing in the second quarter as we continue to rampup new card acquisitions while maintaining some of our value injection efforts we acquired million new cards up around sequentially more importantly than just the total number of cards weve seen great demand for our premium feebased products with new accounts acquired on these products up versus the prior quarter and up almost four times yearoveryear as steve mentioned as some great examples acquisitions of new us consumer and small business platinum and gold cards all reached well above levels this quarter based on the momentum weve seen in the first half of this year we would now expect to see around billion in marketing spend this year ultimately though our marketing levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities we see and the pace at which we finish winding down our value injection efforts in the remainder of the year so what does all this mean for revenues on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the second quarter and we had doubledigit growth in almost every one of our revenue lines except for net interest income american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 which only accounts for of our revenues before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year overyear in the second quarter primarily driven by the uptick in travelrelated revenues our largest revenue line discount revenue led the recovery though as it was up on an fxadjusted basis yearoveryear as shown on slide this recovery is primarily driven by the strong growth in goods and services spending that weve seen over the past few quarters net card fee revenues grew yearoveryear in the quarter importantly these revenues have been our most resilient revenue line throughout the pandemic as you can see on slide they are now million or higher than they were back in the second quarter of demonstrating the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers the one revenue line showing a slower recovery is net interest income on slide which as i mentioned accounts for only of our revenues for us though the driver here is the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances looking ahead i continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes so to sum up on revenues the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in q2 as you can see on slide while revenues remain below prepandemic levels on an fxadjusted basis they were up yearover year looking forward with the momentum in goods and services spend growth weve seen in the first half of the year and our updated assumption that we now expect overall te to recover to of levels by the fourth quarter of the year full year revenue growth could be around to assuming current trends continue moving on to expenses were continuing to break out on slide our variable customer engagement expenses which move with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and opex which are driven by management decisions variable customer engagement expenses in total were up yearoveryear driven by higher spending and usage of travelrelated benefits looking forward a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that id expect them to be about of our total revenues for the remainder of the year moving on to operating expenses you can see that they were down yearoveryear in the second quarter primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our amex ventures equity investment portfolio in full year given the yeartodate gains weve seen in our equity investment portfolio id now expect our full year opex to be a bit below the billion we originally expected as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to build growth momentum in our business turning next to capital on slide our capital position remains tremendously strong our q2 cet1 ratio of remains far above our target levels driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year and growth in our capital base from earnings that have exceeded distributions we returned billion in total to shareholders this quarter including common stock repurchases of million and million in common stock dividends looking forward we remain committed to our longterm cet1 target ratio of to given the federal reserves latest guidance we plan to increase the pace of share repurchases to migrate towards our cet1 ratio target over the next few quarters so lets close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in the first half of the year might mean for the future in january and again in april i laid out two scenarios of potential outcomes for that were primarily based on what happens with credit reserves as a reminder our scenario one or low scenario assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year and that we would not release any credit reserves in the subsequent quarters now halfway into the year the macro outlook has improved somewhat and our actual credit american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 performance has remained incredibly strong so weve already released billion of reserves that still leaves us however with a reserve ratio that is above prepandemic levels due to the remaining uncertainties so our updated scenario one on slide assumes that this uncertainty persists that the medical environment and economic outlook worsens and that we therefore dont release any additional credit reserves this year such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of an overall te recovery by q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery the combination of these things could lead to an eps outcome as low as around per share our updated scenario two in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook leading to less uncertainty and in all likelihood a lower level of credit reserves this sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the to revenue growth assumption i spoke about earlier in this scenario our eps could be as high as around more important though than these numbers is our focus on managing the company to further build growth momentum our progress this quarter around our key drivers volumes credit performance and marketing was very strong and this gives us confidence that our strategies are working based on all these current trends we are confident in our ability in to be within the high end of the range of eps expectations we originally had before the pandemic for of to and we are confident in our ability to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond and with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open the line for questions kevin american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning obviously very strong spending growth i guess when we look inside the billed business growth how much of that strength is coming from pentup demand versus some of the new account growth im just curious just trying to figure out how long this can last obviously knowing that te volume is still on the come and just a quick clarification jeff on the value injections should we assume that as te comes back those value injections slow thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co maybe ill start steve just because your last part of your question is quick sanjay and then you can talk steve about the broader pentup demand trends on value injection sanjay certainly with what were seeing in the world now we would expect that to continue to go down each quarter and be completely gone by the end of the year and so thats one of the reasons as you think about our overall marketing line dollars should be down a little bit in from because value injection will be at zero steve you probably want to talk a little bit about the demand issues stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so sanjay i think its a really good question and if you look at it we didnt acquire anywhere near the amount of cards that we normally acquire last year and if you look at this year were still ramping up and were still not at overall levels of acquisition that wed want to be at and the reason for that is youve got international which has not opened up and so acquisition levels from an international perspective both from an sme side of it from a consumer side of it is not there youve got corporate card acquisition not a lot of companies are adding a lot of people and so you dont have that so when you really start to dig into this a lot of this is really the pentup demand and so just take a look at what were looking at and we look at hilton cobrand cards and we look at delta cobrand cards we continue to see them sequentially monthovermonth add more volume and what youre now seeing is youre seeing volume being added in te but you are seeing sustained volume growth in goods and services and so we think weve done a really good job with the value injection in pivoting sort of people how they thought about these cards and so looking back years from now we may find that one of the sort of the bright spots of this for us from a spending perspective is people found other ways to use their cards and we actually improved our goods and services mix so i think youre seeing that pentup demand coming from existing cardholders and yet were not back to travel levels in any way shape or form the other thing if you start to sort of dig into our spending by sort of age group we mentioned that our millennial spending is up over well then you can just take that and you go to the boomers and you go to our next level of people and that spending is still building up so we believe theres still a lot of spending within our existing base you look at corporate spending which is about half of what it was small business while doing very well from a goods and services perspective is still challenged from a te perspective american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 and so we believe that a lot of the growth that weve had has come from the existing base and i think theres more to come from that existing base and as we get more and more card members onboard youre going to see more spending there as well so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color operator the next question is from betsy graseck morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc morning thanks for taking my question i did want to dig in a little bit on the commentary around the marketing spend and the value injection that you just indicated on slide you go through and indicate the degree of value injection quarterbyquarter and just wanted to understand how you think about that value injection and how that has impacted the retention as well as the acquisition with the question as you move into next year do you think that acquisition and retention rate will be able to remain at levels that youre seeing this year even without that value injection thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so the short answer is yes but you probably want a little more color than that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks yeah stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so if you think about lets go back to why so why did we do the value injection so we did the value injection to make sure that the value propositions that were challenged at the time which were predominantly travelbased value propositions would people wouldnt look at it and say im not getting value from the card and that was i think well look back on that as a very important decision because what it said to our customers is that look we know that you are you bought the product for a specific reason you cannot use that product to we always talk about experiences and access and you cant get that and so what we did was and i give our teams our marketing teams a tremendous amount of credit here is we look for categories that people were going to really doubledown on in streaming services wireless services more shipping services even dining on some of our cobrand cards and we invested a lot of money in value injection the other thing that we did is we also at the top end on our platinum and our centurion is put credits in for travel okay which is one of the reasons i think our tls bookings are now above levels in june and we continued that at the beginning of the year because the beginning of the year we were still unsure but we changed the value injection so on platinum card we went to a paypal credit and that paypal credit was to get more embedding within that ecosystem so that you have more cards on file but our plan has been and always has been is that the value that we have in our products stands on its own and once we got to the point where people could take advantage of the existing product and this is predominantly more of a us phenomenon at this particular point in time you didnt need that value injection and so then we get back to okay what did we learn and then you look at the platinum refresh and if you look at the platinum refresh what does that have well it has a wider variety of components to it in terms of streaming american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 it has digital credits whether its sirius or peacock or new york times or what have you and it also has another travel credit within there and so we dont believe we need to rely on value injection at all and so as you look at the high marketing going forward we believe the value of the products will stand for themselves having said that were also going to go back on our quest to continue to refresh our product portfolio and youre seeing that you obviously just saw that with the platinum card and were not going to stop at the platinum card but ill stop at that comment at this point and so when you look at the billion in spending what we made the decision this year is we werent going to cap that spending so at the beginning of the year youre seeing a lot of value injection but we also made the decision at the beginning of the year to go in with more customer acquisition and so well continue to do that which will drive us closer to the billion but the bottom line on this is that our products were resilient through this we propped them up a little bit we learned a lot and what were seeing with our consumers right now is that they are utilizing these value propositions and theyre utilizing these value propositions with lounge visits with bookings by using the travel credits and all the benefits that come with gold and platinum we talk a lot about platinum but the gold card too is another premium product that we have and that has been positioned a lot more as a dining product and that has taken off as restaurants especially in the united states have come back so the short answer i guess is that we dont believe we need value injection anymore we believe the value in the products will continue to sustain the spending operator our next question is from the line of david togut evercore please go ahead david mark togut q analyst evercore isi thank you good morning what is your expected timeline and trajectory of the international te billings recovery and as a related question on international when will domestic china american express become material to overall revenue and earnings stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co all right so the first one if anybody on the call can tell me that would be good because i dont know i think youve got a situation in europe look at japan with the olympics right i mean everybody is expecting spectators to be there theres no spectators there youve got australia which is still closed youve got the uk which is battling the delta variant and so i dont know whats going to happen with international having said that our billings continue to improve in international people much like they were in the us are looking for ways to travel whether that be car trips whether that be more restaurant and so forth and so i dont really expect international to come back this year and hopefully at some point next year but thats really all going to be driven by vaccination and the efficacy of vaccinations and remember the vaccines that are available in other countries are not the same vaccines that are available in the united states and theres different efficacy on all different types of vaccines whether thats astrazeneca which has like a efficacy or its a moderna or a pfizer which is up at and so what youre seeing in the uk now is vaccinated people actually get covid not being hospitalized or dying but still getting covid so i dont think were going to see international come back this year i think and its not really we look at it as a tailwind for sort of and for us as far as china goes look china is were really pleased with whats going on in china and part of the china story is continuing to build the network and continuing to build the card base and we continue monthovermonth to build that network and to build that card base and as we move into other quarters well provide more insight american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 into whats going on but im not i wouldnt say you can expect china to be a material part of our revenue base or our earnings base in the nearterm future more medium to longterm but id also like to remind everybody of the model that we have in china the model that we have in china is a networkbased model and the way to think about a networkbased model is to think about that model much like visa and mastercards normal model is were not taking card fees were not getting a discount rate were getting network fees and thats the way thats working but we are building china we believe itll add more scale not only for us and more presence in china for both our card members that travel there but itll also add scale for us as chinese card members travel outside of china and add more scale and add more volume to the overall network so china will not be material in the near term jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co steve i would just emphasize one point back on the international spending which is it is important to go back to slide of the deck and realize that outside the us spending on goods and services actually has recovered just as strongly as it has in the us and we expect that will continue the other thing to remember is that as we express our confidence in our ability to get to our financial objectives were really not counting on international te coming back in any meaningful way next year we are confident it will at some point and whenever it does thatll be a tailwind but its not a key element of our confidence about so next question operator operator and thats from the line of ryan nash goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning steve good morning jeff jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so i maybe just wanted to flesh out the expectations a little bit further so jeff you talked about to revenue growth this year i think that would put you back at levels so can you maybe explain to us whats incorporated for the high end in terms of spend and top line are you assuming that gs could continue to run elevated or are you assuming some sort of a handoff to te given all the pentup demand and secondly jeff can you maybe just clarify the capital comments how quickly can you get back to to it seems like there could be a pretty big buyback over the next few quarters thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well maybe well work backwards steve because i think the capital one is simpler than the first one on capital ryan you should as i said in my remarks look were going to increase the pace of our share repurchases and we will get back within our cet1 target range of to over the next few quarters in many ways the governor on that is as we increase the size of our share repurchases we want to be mindful of overall volumes in the market and were not trying to do anything that is in the nearterm going to drive the stock price so well get there in the next few quarters exactly when will be a little bit of a function of what kind of volumes and trading we american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 see in the overall market but were committed to being in that to range and that means we got a lot of capital to return to shareholders stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so as we think about next year and now look we went from comments of our aspiration was to be in the range to comments today of our anticipation is well be at the high end of the range so whats driving that the first thing i want to sort of clearly state is given that the recovery is uneven we will continue to invest as weve been investing and i think we have pulled back in our international card investment right now because it just doesnt make a lot of sense to continue to doubledown on that and so we will continue as we move into next year to invest in not only our us card acquisition but international card acquisition both small business and premium products what are the assumptions behind sort of next years getting to that high end well look we need consumer te to fully recover in and its on a path to do that so that is i think good obviously wed like a reasonably healthy economy as well and so all things being equal things continue the way they are in the us we feel really confident whats not in those financial objectives is the following a full recovery of net interest income and you can look at our revenue and you see where we are from a net interest income perspective corporate te is not factored in there which we dont believe thatll come back until crossborder te we believe will continue to be challenged and the comments that jeff just made about international while goods and services we think will continue to grow i think consumer te and corporate te in international will continue to be challenged so if that comes back obviously that provides upside and they would be tailwinds for but we would more be counting on those as tailwinds for but again its really hard to predict but thats a positive for us the one thing i will have people keep in mind though is that weve had some big reserve releases and as jeff mentioned when we talked about sort of to the would anticipate some more releases which would mean even bigger reserve releases and so you have to grow over that and part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary billed that we did last year but id like to point out the other part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary job our credit team is doing and so thats the other piece of it that we take into account all that being said we feel really good about how were tracking for this year and thats why we feel good about saying the high end of the range for and i just gave you a bunch of upside possibilities and i just gave you the growover possibility as well with the also notion is were not going to get were not going to cut marketing to get there were not going to be at billion because we will not have value injection there but we will continue to invest in marketing because i think it has proven for us to be a great source of revenue growth operator our next question is from the line of chris donat piper sandler please go ahead christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co good morning gentlemen i had one question about net card fees jeff when i look prepandemic theyve been growing and this is slide growing around and then with the pandemic and the lower issues going on there growth decelerated for the net card fees as we think about the remainder of and and what youve got going on with retention and the value injections and it sounds like a ton of good things going on on the acquisition side should we expect an acceleration in net card fee growth over coming quarters jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 so chris as i said in my remarks we feel really good about the net card fee growth in fact i like to point out that the dollars that we have grown net card fees by more than million a quarter since interestingly kind of offsets the drop in net interest income and we have a lot further to go all that said as most of you know the accounting for card fees is a little complicated because we amortize peoples card fee payments over months after they pay them and so that causes the trends to move slowly so ive said through much of this year that i expected card fee growth because we werent acquiring a lot of new card members last year to slow quite significantly in the back half of the year and i will tell you now that with the tremendous progress on bringing new feepaying card members into the franchise i think you might see a little bit of slowing in the next couple quarters before it reaccelerates next year but boy its a lot less than we originally anticipated the other thing i would remind people of is its really bringing new feepaying card members into the franchise that drives net card fee growth and in fact when you think steve about the platinum refresh that you talked about well we raised the fee for existing card members that fee actually doesnt hit until their anniversary date next year and then once it hits well amortize it over months so its a lovely long tailwind but its not going to be the driver of the next couple of quarters stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co right and the only other point id make is if you look at that net card fees the absolute dollars continue to grow and so and thats a direct result of the retention efforts operator and the next question is from the line of moshe orenbuch credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks and wanted to kind of talk a little bit about the of variable customer engagement costs and how to think about that in the coming years one of the things that youve obviously had tremendous success and you alluded to them in the kind of prepared remarks in terms of the spending on the cobrand cards but some of those contracts have kind of both volume levels and accelerators if i recall the delta cobrand was supposed to accelerate to in terms of the payments could you talk a little bit about that your views on that jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well a couple comments moshe first because of the effects of the pandemic the variable customer engagement costs sort of have been flowing with revenues but if you go back a year you had our card members suddenly not redeeming travelrelated benefits not traveling around and that caused some unusual declines boy the good news now is theyre back traveling and that recovery means that now were back incurring some of those costs and that makes the yearoveryear when you look at it just for the quarter look a little unusual thats why for simplicity purposes weve said look were running at about of total revenues id expect that to be the case for the next few quarters next year well have to see how all parts of the business are performing i guess if i step back from all the math though i would just say its a very good thing to see our members back engaged with our travelrelated benefits we feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace given the kind of acquisition and retention numbers steve talked about and its those card member engagement costs that drive that tremendous attachment for our existing customers and the ability to attract new customers so i think the is a good number for the next few quarters and well have to see where it ends up next year and well give you an update american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 operator our next question is from the line of lisa ellis moffettnathanson please go ahead lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hi thanks i had a question about retention youve been highlighting the strength in retention throughout the pandemic and just taking a peek at the supplementals it looks like youre up million in cardsinforce on million in cards acquired so that is in fact very good retention can you just talk a bit about whats been driving that and whether or not you think it will persist after the pandemic and so can we expect sustained growth in cardsinforce going forward thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well look i think as i said i think some of the decisions that we made around value injection some of the decisions we made around providing relief but i will tell you i think the largest thing that drove retention at the beginning of this pandemic were not a lot of companies were answering the phone and our customer satisfaction scores from a servicing perspective really went through the roof for us during the pandemic we pivoted people to home very very quickly we had equipment at the ready for them and they felt safe they felt secure and they were able to take care of our customers and so at that time people called american express we were there to help them and if you think about the help that we provided to people it was im not taking i cant take my trip im canceled i had tickets to this i had to whatever it might have been and we were able to help and when you help somebody one time thats a lifetime savior because theyll always remember it and the reality is i think it was the combination of outstanding customer service because more people needed customer service during this pandemic than they ever did before especially with cancellations of events and i think we stood out i think we stood out among everybody else once again and i think the value injection and the financial relief programs and we have continually looked to engage with our customers throughout the pandemic and meet their needs so our hope is and were seeing it persist right now is that well continue to retain these customers and build their loyalty but i would not downplay customer services role in this retention i cant tell you how many emails and letters i got that people were calling out to say look i was on hold with somebody for five hours and i went to you and you guys were able to handle it you answered the call in four five minutes so i think that really helped a lot lisa i really do operator our next question is from the line of rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks for taking my question this morning im curious when you think about the recovery of te in the fourth quarter how important corporate travel is to that recovery and the reason that i raise that is i think theres an important distinction between leisure travel which has a long planning cycle and business travel which tends to have a much shorter planning cycle and im assuming that that short planning cycle creates volatility in terms of your expectations and im curious how much upsidedownside there is associated with that corporate travel stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 yeah i would say very little downside because were assuming were not assuming very much and were just using ourselves as an example there are a lot of companies that are still not even back yet right and its hard to travel when youre not back and its hard to travel when theres nobody to travel to i think new york is a little bit different phenomenon in the financial services here but the reality is is were not assuming very much from a corporate travel perspective minimal improvement from really where we are so the downside volatility i think is negligible the upside is pretty positive but again were not anticipating a lot of travel having said that corporate travel will come back anybody that believes that zoom webex or google meets or microsoft teams or what have you is going to take the place of facetoface is crazy its not i think its a great supplement but ultimately people will get back but people are still antsy about getting out there but not so much for consumer travel theyre pretty willing to get out for consumer travel but they are a little bit again i think for corporate travel its a different thing but the reality is it will come back and i think theres nothing like facetoface interaction and doing business that way and so but i see it more as upside rick and not a volatile downside now having said that if it does come back and then goes down thats when the volatility comes in but i think behavior once it shifts back to corporate travel i believe will stay there jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and rick the only numbers id add to that is yes we expect q4 to be at about overall led by consumer though to steves point so id expect global consumer to be at probably of levels us consumer at or above levels and of course the other thing steve thats interesting is small businesses even now are traveling more than the large businesses stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co right jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co its the large businesses where you really dont see any signs of life right now and were not counting on any operator our next question is from the line of mark devries barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks just a quick clarification and then a biggerpicture question on the higher end guidance for does that contemplate reserve releases that gets you down around kind of the cecl day one level and then kind of bigpicture for steve whats your experience been historically on the impact of wealth effects on spend because obviously if you look at since the beginning of last year there have been some pretty significant wealth effects for a lot of your cardholders and what implications that may have for kind of where spend levels can recover to once your customers dont have the same restrictions on their activities stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so wealth ive said this many times consumers like to consume and so giving opportunities to consume they will start consuming and ive been here a long time and i remember after people sort of didnt travel american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 and sort of hoarded a little bit and then all of a sudden it exploded and if you look back historically you saw tremendous growth for us after and it wasnt in travel i mean people started to spend on their homes spend on other lifestyle choices and things like that and eventually travel came back and so i think the wealth if you look at the savings that has accumulated within the united states and the wealth that has accumulated from stock appreciation and what have you i think that only bodes well for us for people to continue to spend and so i would anticipate and again we saw this right after and we saw this after the financial crisis as well just tells you ive been around a long time and i think that will actually happen but weve never seen i havent seen wealth accumulation like this across the continuum when you look at the overall savings rate and then just look at where the stock market is obviously at an alltime high so i think that really bodes that bodes well for us as we think about spending going forward and thats why were bullish on and beyond jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and on the credit reserves mark id point out on slide in dollar terms we are actually already below the dollar reserves that we had day one of cecl billion now versus billion whats still above however day one is the percent of the actual loans outstanding that the reserves represent if you think about that scenario certainly i would anticipate that that includes some reserve releases that bring that percentage below the day one cecl percentage the unknowable question at this point is how far below but when you think about the credit metrics right now it would suggest that your reserve levels once all the various kinds of uncertainty work themselves through it would suggest that your reserves as a percentage of loans outstanding should be significantly lower operator and the next question is from the line of bill carcache wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning steve and jeff jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc your lendcentric competitors have been very focused on elevated payment rates is amex at all focused on stepping in to capture a greater share of balance growth as payment rates normalize i know capturing your fair share of balances that amex customers carry with competitors was a big focus prepandemic but would appreciate any color on whether this is an opportunity that youre actively looking to pursue now stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think obviously during the pandemic that obviously slowed down but were back at it and the reality is we can be back at it but if theyre not going to revolve balances it really doesnt matter but we have opened up again obviously we tightened up just to remind everybody we tightened up our credit controls prepandemic and that allowed us to go in pretty quickly and i think do a lot of really good things for our customers and for ourselves but weve opened it up this year and were out there looking to acquire balances were not going to do crazy american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 stuff but were looking at acquiring balances where it makes sense and when i mean acquiring balances im not talking about zero interest rate things like that what im talking about is engaging with our customers to see what their revolve needs are and to see if we can meet those needs whether it be through a pay it plan it or whether it be through a consumer personal loan or whether it just be through a normal card revolve product so thats how were thinking about it operator our next question is from the line of don fandetti wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc steve could you provide an update on the amazon small business cobrand partnership and also whether it would make sense to look at the consumer cobrand if that were to come to market it seems like a deal you dont necessarily need but maybe it makes sense in some areas stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well look heres what i would say were really happy with our overall amazon relationship and that is a multi faceted relationship not only do we buy amazon services from them but small business i think has been a good thing for both of us i think its been good for our customers i think weve been able to offer some great value a lot of our customers use it as a companion product and so thats worked i think our pay with points efforts with amazon has really worked and what i would say about cobrand opportunities look we look at them all that makes sense and we look at predominantly weve had a lot of travel cobrands obviously weve also had other cobrands and people who remember the costco cobrand but weve also had a lowes cobrand for small business obviously we have the amazon cobrand for small business as well and not just in the united states but in a couple of other markets and we look at the opportunities and what we do is we look at those opportunities and can we provide a value proposition that makes sense to our customers and can we do that in an economical way and an economical way may not just be the economics of the cobrand deal itself it may also be the economics of what a cobrand could do to the overall portfolio both positively and negatively and so theres a lot of things you look at when you evaluate a cobrand and well do whats right for our customers and our shareholders operator and our next question is from the line of bob napoli william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc good morning steve and jeff a question on the related i guess to the smb market itself and the competitive environment youve seen new players coming into that market whether its somebody like square or there are a number of fintechs that are doing charge cards with spend management attached to it maybe just some thoughts on the importance of the growth of smb what youre doing and how you view any change in the competitive environment and what new value injections that maybe not in that term but products or services youre looking to add in maybe us and international stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 yeah well i think let me just ill just mention international international right now certainly different competitive environment internationally than in the united states theres not one competitor its competitors by market but i would say at the moment not a hotbed of activity small businesses the viability of a number of small businesses in international markets not a lot of people have line of sight into those right now and were not growing anywhere near like we used to grow if you remember small business international high double digits high doubledigit teens for two three years in a row and so and we think we can get back to that we just dont we dont see that happening this year and were not counting on it for next year but internationally youre competing with local banks and so forth and again weve done amazon deals in multiple countries and i think that has helped and we continue to look for partnerships where they make sense in the united states we continue to grow in fact june was one of our best acquisition months in the history of our small business card in the united states so were really pleased with that there is a lot of competition theres a lot of fintechs there are banks out there capital one is aggressive us bank is aggressive jp everybody is aggressive in this space and ultimately it comes down to value and we continue to grow and again here from a small business perspective i think we did a nice job with value injection i think you will see us continue our strategy of product refreshes over the coming year but i think one of the big things that weve done obviously is the kabbage acquisition and just last month we launched the kabbage checking account the working capital cash flow analysis and so forth and what youll see ultimately is that kabbage platform being the landing point for our small businesses and the way you want to think about this is is fintech with scale and so when you think about kabbage which is a pureplay fintech in the small business space and you think about american express and the small businesses and you combine that together you have a fintech at scale not a fintech growing at scale a fintech growing from scale from scale with a balance sheet and so that has always been the vision of kabbage weve made as you bring kabbage into the bank holding company structure you have to do some other things to futureproof it if you will and thats what weve been doing but thats what you will see ultimately what you will see is a fintech with a traditional bank scale and a very strong balance sheet and well continue to add products as we move along onto that platform and that was the vision right i mean we see a lot of other people out there doing those kinds of things but to be able to do that at scale from the getgo i think is a big win for us so thats the vision in the mediumterm here for kabbage and we just launched that platform from an amex perspective just last month with those other products on it operator and our final question will come from the line of craig maurer autonomous research please go ahead craig maurer q analyst autonomous research llp yes hi thanks for taking the questions and squeezing me in i really wanted to ask about the competitive environment in highend us consumer considering we just saw citi shut down their platinum competitor going forward has the us premium consumer race really just boiled down now to two competitors amex and chase thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so i dont know thats the best way to answer it look i dont know what citis strategy is i dont know if its just a pullback for now to a reentry thats a possibility i know wells is looking to get stronger in this space and so what we really focus in on craig is we focus in on is developing the best product possible and to make sure we can take on allcomers and some may say in the middle of the pandemic youre relaunching your american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2021 platinum card and youre raising the fee yeah we are why because that was part of the strategy we learned a lot during the pandemic as well we were able to enhance the product when you look at it we added worth of additional value for worth of additional cost and as a great example of leveraging our partnerships leveraging our knowhow leveraging the digital assets that we have whether that be resy or loungebuddy or what have you within that overall collection and so yeah maybe it might look like right now its chase and american express and chase is a very formidable competitor with very smart people who are working really hard to beat us and were working really hard to beat them but im not assuming its going to be just us and chase for long i think you will see other people i think try and get in this game and our platinum refresh is another shot across the bow at anybody that really wants to come in and play in this game were ready and well continue to up our game and up our service and provide even more and more value to our card members and look as i said in my remarks the platinum refresh last time worked and that was in the face of jpmorgan chase entering in with a strong product and we believe its going to work this time and early results and obviously were only in for three weeks here but if you just do the value calculation it is a really strong product and were really proud of what weve put out in the marketplace vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations
