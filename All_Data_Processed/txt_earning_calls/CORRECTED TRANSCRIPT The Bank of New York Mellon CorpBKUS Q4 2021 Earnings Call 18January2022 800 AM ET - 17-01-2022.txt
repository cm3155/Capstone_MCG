chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks marius and thank you everyone for joining us this morning emily will review our fourth quarter results and spend some time on our outlook in a moment but before that id like to touch on a few financial performance highlights for the full year and talk about the progress the firm has made across a number of dimensions in last year was in many regards remarkable for bny mellon and i couldnt be prouder of the resilience dedication and innovative mindset of our management team and our exceptional colleagues around the world you know as i reflected on the year there were three broad themes that really stood out to me one was our outstanding sales performance and improved organic growth the second one was the number of new and innovative solutions that were working on and in many cases have already brought to the market and the third was our improved effectiveness in harnessing our unique one bny mellon culture and the capabilities that we have by delivering more comprehensive and differentiated solutions to our clients now ill expand a little bit on each of these points in a moment together with a supportive market backdrop and a benign credit environment our meaningfully improved organic growth has allowed us to more than offset the stiff headwind that we had from lower interest rates and deliver a solid and improved financial performance in referring to slide of our financial highlights presentation we reported eps of for the full year of thats up yearoveryear revenue of billion was up slightly yearoveryear as 2pluspercent organic growth and the benefit of higher market levels offset lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers fee revenue was up yearoveryear and about excluding the impact of money market fee waivers and expenses were up yearoveryear reflecting our investments as well as the quality of revenue that we generated our pretax margin of as well as our return on tangible common equity of were roughly in line with the prior year and we returned billion of capital or of earnings to our shareholders through common dividends and billion of share repurchases as i said earlier was marked by outstanding sales performance and a meaningful increase in organic growth in fact organic growth was the highest that weve seen in a number of years in asset servicing wins were up almost compared to which has produced a meaningful pipeline of auca our average deal size was up as we won larger and more complex businesses and just as importantly our retention rates also continued to improve we believe this success is a testament to our service quality and its also a reflection of our broader capabilities as well as our open architecture framework which is resonating with our clients and is differentiating us in the marketplace the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 id also like to call out our etf business which has delivered substantial growth and gained market share our etf auca grew by roughly which outpaced the broader market and that doesnt yet include our recent win of approximately billion of blackrocks ishares issuer services delivered meaningful organic growth on the back of the resumption of depositary receipt issuance and dividend activity following what had been a covidrelated slowdown in and a continued strong sales performance pershing gathered record new assets of about billion and continued to grow active clearing accounts in the midsingledigits despite the headwind of deconverting a couple of large clients in the second half of the year growth has been notably broadbased across brokerdealers and registered investment advisors clients have told us numerous times that our ability to bring brokerdealer and ria solutions together as one is a real differentiator and we continue to benefit from our uniquely unconflicted role in the marketplace as we dont compete with our clients treasury services delivered strong organic growth on the back of payment volumes recovering to above pre covid levels and we improved the average price per payment transaction by about as we continue to shift the product mix towards higher valueadded channels clearance and collateral management is now running at a record trillion of collateral management balances balance growth has benefited from our unique role as the primary clearer of us government securities and weve also seen continued growth in international balances our markets business has offset the impact of lower volatility and tighter spreads compared to the prior year with strong broadbased organic growth across fx and securities lending investment management saw the highest net inflows into longterm products since driven by our ldi and fixed income strategies but also including strong net inflows into our responsible investment funds as well as strength in our initial suite of index etfs billion of net inflows into cash products were the highest in over a decade we optimized our money market fund lineup to provide a more competitive and scalable offering and with our new cio in place were thrilled to see strong flows and improving market share and finally our wealth management business acquired significantly more new clients in than in and im pleased to see how the team is executing against the strategic plan that we put in place a few years ago weve continued to gain further traction in the larger fastergrowing client segments and our expanded banking offering both on the lending as well as the deposit side has driven a meaningful uptick in the percentage of wealth management clients who also bank with us the second theme i mentioned earlier was innovation and in some cases its been outright disruption this is probably the area that is most exciting for us i cannot recall in my tenure at the company a year in which we launched or rolled out more innovative products and services than we did over the last months ill call out just a few digital assets while still early days and recognizing that the regulatory landscapes in this space is still evolving our investments in building an industryfirst integrated digital and traditional assets offering are clearly showing positive initial results following the launch of our digital assets unit at the beginning of last year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 we solidified our leadership in servicing crypto funds with the announcement of our partnership with grayscale investments over the summer weve contracted with almost half of the pending funds in the us and service most of the crypto funds in canada as i said its still early days but were excited about the disruptive potential of tokenization as well as smart contracts and the associated opportunities both on the revenue as well as the efficiency side in terms of realtime payments this is an area that we embraced early on and we continue to lead with innovative solutions to drive the proliferation of realtime payments in the us you may remember that we were the first bank to originate a payment on the clearing houses realtime payments network several years ago and late last year we were the first to launch our realtime bill pay solution for billers and their customers were pleased by the initial uptake weve already onboarded additional clients and the long list of interested prospects continues to grow as you know the market for treasury services is large and its growing but its still very fragmented and ripe for disruption so were excited about the market leadership coming out of our treasury services business it really goes far beyond just realtime payments and include examples like being able to leverage the cloud for wire payments and having been the first bank to complete a trade finance deal using sofr third item is the future of collateral as the worlds largest global collateral manager we continue to lead the charge in driving towards global collateral mobility and optimization by connecting distinct platforms expanding the scope of eligible collateral and implementing new capabilities for example last year we introduced chinese bonds as eligible collateral on our global triparty platform and we were the first bank to add agency mortgagebacked securities as collateral on overnight cleared repo transactions and another first we started offering our clients the ability to accept collateral based on their esg criteria through our digital platform and finally id be remiss not to mention the launch of pershing x which we introduced last quarter pershing x will design and build innovative solutions for the advisory industry including a leading endtoend wealth advisory platform that will help firms and their advisors solve the challenge of managing multiple and disconnected technology and datasets while certainly a multiyear project the team has hit the ground running in this past quarter we acquired optimal asset management which is not only an important step in our buildout of pershing x and that it will allow us to offer direct indexing capabilities to our advisory clients within pershing but it will also benefit our investment management business as well the third and last theme is what we call one bny mellon now ive always been proud of our collaborative culture here at bny mellon and as you know our broader portfolio of businesses differentiates us from our competitors over the years weve emphasized the interconnectivity of these businesses and the meaningful operational synergies between many of them but we can still do a better job at delivering the whole firm to our clients and so last year we conducted a thorough review of the opportunities and further enhanced our setup for crossbusiness collaboration and ive been highlighting some of the most notable crossbusiness client wins such as amundi lockheed martin and oak hill on our earnings calls over the last couple of quarters our ability to seamlessly deliver a much broader set of capabilities from across our securities services our market and wealth services the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 and investment and wealth management businesses is a unique value proposition for our clients and our intensified collaboration effort is already driving higher revenues in summary im pleased with the progress weve made over the last months and while we certainly have more work to do im confident that the company is on the right path for sustainably higher organic growth as we look to and beyond we expect doubledigit earnings per share growth as we are determined to continue delivering consistent organic growth which together with the current expectation for higher rates should enable us to generate positive operating leverage while at the same time continue investing in the growth and efficiency of our businesses with that ill turn it over to emily emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd and good morning everyone before i review our financial results i would like to spend a moment highlighting our new financial disclosures last month we announced that starting in the fourth quarter were going to report investment services which was our largest segment as two new business segments securities services which includes asset servicing and issuer services and market and wealth services which includes pershing treasury services and clearance and collateral management our third segment investment and wealth management remains unchanged we made this change to increase the visibility of some of our most differentiated businesses to better align our reporting with how we already manage the firm and to provide additional granularity for all of our stakeholders to better track our performance against our strategy with that i will turn to page and our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise total revenue for the fourth quarter was up fee revenue also grew by or excluding the impact of fee waivers this reflects the benefit of higher market values and continued healthy organic growth while not on the page firmwide auca of trillion increased by with roughly of the increase driven by growth from new and existing business and driven by higher market value and aum of trillion increased by reflecting higher market values and full year net inflows money market fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense were million in the quarter an increase of million compared to the prior quarter entirely driven by higher money market fund balances with no meaningful impact on pretax income investment and other revenue was million and included a roughly million valuation gain on a strategic equity investment our investments continue to pay off both strategically as well as in the form of higher valuation net interest revenue was flat expenses were up or excluding notable items our provision for credit losses was a benefit of million primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast eps was this includes a negative impact of litigation reserves and severance expense as well as a positive impact of the provision benefit pretax margin was and our return on tangible common equity was quickly for the full year which todd summarized earlier on page total revenue grew by reflecting higher fee revenue partially offset by lower net interest revenue fee revenue grew by or excluding the impact of fee waivers investment and other revenue was million a strong year with meaningful gains on our strategic equity portfolio and net interest revenue was down the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 expenses were up both on a reported basis as well as excluding notable items excluding the impact of notable items nearly half of the increase was driven by higher net incremental investments and the remainder was roughly evenly split between revenuerelated expenses and the unfavorable impact of the weaker us dollar provision for credit losses was a benefit of million eps was our pretax margin of as well as our return on tangible common equity of were roughly in line with the prior year on to capital and liquidity on page our tier leverage ratio which is our binding capital constraint was down approximately basis points sequentially primarily driven by a return of billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter including billion of buybacks partially offset by earnings and we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of down approximately basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter finally our lcr was slightly lower than in the prior quarter turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page which i will talk about in sequential term net interest revenue was million in the fourth quarter up sequentially this increase was driven by the impact of higher shortterm rates on floating rate securities in our investment portfolio disciplined deposits and liability pricing and higher loan and securities balances in the interestearning asset mix average deposit balances increased slightly by sequentially and while interest earning assets were roughly flat average loans increased by about with growth primarily driven by margin loans collateralized loans in wealth management and growth in capital call financing we also deployed some additional cash in hqla securities resulting in a quarteroverquarter increase of the overall average investment securities portfolio of moving on to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were billion up yearoveryear excluding the impact of notable items expenses were up just over half of which was driven by incremental investments net of efficiency savings and the remainder by higher revenuerelated expenses including higher staff expenses a few additional details regarding noteworthy quarteroverquarter expense variances staff expense was up driven by severance expense and incentive compensation net occupancy expense was up driven by expenses associated with exiting leased space as we continue to optimize our real estate footprint and some expenses related to return to the office business development expense increased driven by higher marketing expenses as well as te other expenses was down due to lower litigation reserves on to page for a closer look at our new business segments securities services reported total revenue of billion or up let me just describe a little about what makes up this increase fee revenue was up and up excluding the impact of fee waivers investment and other revenue benefited from a gain on a strategic equity investment and net interest revenue was down driven by lower interest rates partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances as i discuss the lines of business within our securities services and market and wealth services segment i will focus my comments on the investment services fees each of which you can find in our financial supplement in asset servicing investment services fees grew by excluding the impact of fee waivers investment services fees were up primarily driven by higher activity from existing clients higher market values and net new business our strong performance last year came on the back of already healthy sales in and we gained further sales momentum in as our continued investments in innovation are paying off the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 in issuer services investment services fees were down but excluding the impact of fee waivers investment services fees were up healthy growth in depositary receipts was largely offset by the impact of the previously disclosed discontinued public sector mandate in corporate trust fx revenue in our securities services segment increased by as solid volume growth from existing and new clients more than offset the impact of lower volatility next on to market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up primarily driven by higher net interest revenue and fees fee revenue was up and up excluding the impact of fee waivers net interest revenue was up on the back of higher loan balances partially offset by lower interest rates in pershing investment services fees were down however excluding the impact of fee waivers investment services fees were up as the impact of clients lost earlier in the year was more than offset by growth on the back of higher market values client balances and activity from existing clients the business continued to see good underlying growth net new assets in the quarter were billion and clearing account were up year overyear in treasury services investment services fees were up excluding the impact of fee waivers the investment services fees were up primarily driven by higher payment volume and in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up reflecting broadbased growth on the back of higher triparty collateral management balances and clearance volumes both in the us and internationally turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of billion up fee revenue was up and excluding the impact of fee waivers net interest revenue was up on the back of higher loan balances partially offset by lower interest rates assets under management grew to trillion up yearoveryear reflecting higher market values and full year net inflows into both longterm specifically ldi and fixed income and cash products for the quarter we saw billion of net inflows into cash and billion of outflows from longterm products investment management revenue was down however excluding the impact of fee waivers revenue was up primarily driven by higher market values and fullyear net inflows partially offset by lower seed capital gains and performance fees wealth management revenue grew by driven by higher market values the absence of a loss on a business sale in the fourth quarter of the prior year and higher net interest revenue on the back of healthy loan growth as we continue to deepen client relationships into banking client assets continue to grow at a steady pace and were billion up yearonyear page shows the results of the other segment i will close with our outlook for on page ill start with a reminder that our outlook is based on the current forward curve with that in mind we currently expect nir to increase by approximately in primarily driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix partially offset by an expectation for lower deposit balances the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 our expectation for continued organic growth and lower fee waivers results in total fee growth of approximately in more specifically we expect roughly of the increase to be driven by the recovery of money market fee waivers based on the current forward curve and assuming some runoff in money market fund balances from current levels we expect roughly to be driven by organic growth and approximately by marketdriven factors and as a reminder we generally expect a quarterly run rate of around million for investment and other revenue but as you know this line can be lumpy due to seed capital gains strategic equity investments and other components for expenses ex notable items we expect an increase of approximately yearoveryear roughly of the increase is expected to be driven by higher revenuerelated expenses which include higher distribution and servicing expenses associated with fee waivers and the impact of inflationary pressures the remainder is driven by investments roughly half of which is just the annualization of incremental investment in the second half of last year specific to the first quarter id like to remind you that staff expenses are typically elevated due to longterm incentive compensation expense for retirementeligible employees as a result we expect first quarter expenses ex notables to be up approximately yearoveryear with regards to capital management we expect to return roughly of earnings subject to changes in aoci and deposit balances and for the sake of completeness we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately to sum up and as todd alluded to earlier we expect to generate positive operating leverage on the back of continued organic growth and higher rates translating into higher nir and lower fee waivers while continuing to invest in the future growth and efficiency of our businesses with that operator can you please open the line for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 question and answer section operator yes operator instructions our first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much i wonder if you could unpack the net interest revenue comment of outlook for around maybe just trajectorywise meaning im assuming youre assuming the forward curve and so just talk about the timing as that comes in and you can combine that with how quickly the fee waiver recapture happens along that forward curve thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure sure good morning glenn and happy new year im actually really glad you kicked off with nir because its the first time in a long time weve got something positive to say so nir as we mentioned is expected to be up about yearonyear to give you color just specific to the questions you asked yes we just use the forward curve and as you know it at the moment anticipate three rate hikes three 25basispoint rate hikes the first being in march although of course theres talk about the first one being a bit more and we can talk about the sensitivity there deposit betas obviously come back into play the expectation in our outlook is that betas will largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle they could be a little bit higher just given the change in our deposit mix so for example treasury services the deposit base there is about twice as big as it was in and obviously that business has higher betas we expect our securities portfolio to be roughly flat most of the reduction on the asset side will be coming from cash held at central banks and loweryielding hqla we do continue to be cautious on duration in fact over the last six weeks weve brought duration in a bit and weve actually moved some hqla into htm to preserve capital also we are expecting some healthy loan growth and for premium amortization to reduce a bit the one just glenn one thing i do want to just point out is that for the first quarter just given that the first rate hike is not until march also its just worth mentioning weve already seen deposits come down a bit from the fourth quarter average where they were really at elevated levels due to kind of market dynamics so you wont see much of that benefit sequentially in q1 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay got a lot there thank you and maybe just one other big picture i think i heard you say in the prepared organic growth in 2022ish which would be in line with and obviously better than and so i guess the question is when you look at the investments youre making and combine it with your fee outlook im just curious how you can contextualize whats there related to markets that have already gone up business that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 has already been won to be implemented versus followthrough and revenues related to new investments the investments that youre making in new businesses thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp maybe ill take that one so a lot in that one but a couple of things when i look at collateral management thats one where we have been investing for quite a while and we invest in what we call the future of collateral which is really making collateral interoperable around the world which we thought would lead to growth in our especially in our international assets which is exactly what it has done also benefiting from those capabilities is the the responsibility now for derivative players to have collateral against their uncleared margins we have were now going through phase of that so we are picking up significant assets as a result of that and weve also added certain innovations to our capabilities for example the ability to have esg criteria established in a repo and what youll accept on repo so thats something thats shown some pretty interesting growth so thats something where we have been gaining and its shown up in the numbers and we continue to expect to continue to gain i mean one of the other interesting things that weve brought up is what were doing in our treasury services and payments business and i think weve reinvigorated that business with some meaningful investment we were the first as you know to do an rtp realtime payments through the new york clearing house that was done essentially to test it but now were actually putting practical product in place so we announced late last year a request for payment service that were providing to utilities that operation we have multiple players on that platform and we see opportunity whether its brokerage firms insurance companies corporates or white labeling it for midsized banks there so i think some of the innovation that were seeing in the treasury services we have not seen that drop to the bottom line yet weve picked up weve captured a little bit of market share and a little bit of a better price itself coming into this weve talked a fair amount about pershing x which is a significant multiyear investment that were making in our pershing platform specifically on the advisors to simplify and make the advisory function much more productive for our clients we made an acquisition of a direct indexing firm in the quarter we decided to buy rather than build for speed to the market and that group is going to be able to tailor portfolios and provide tax optimization down to the individual level that hasnt started yet so that will start probably by the end of this year and well be continuing to invest so we see that not as a event but a and nice growth in our wealth management business and here weve invested in some of the technology and weve won some recognition for the quality of some of the advice path and kind of the wealth management tools that weve put in place for our clients there the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 on the asset servicing side weve talked about the digital assets unit that we put in place it is garnering assets quite rapidly as weve gotten most of the pending etf crypto assets that are coming in the us and just in a very high percentage offshore especially in canada weve also got the we developed an esg app where were starting to see some revenues flow on that and were investing just in the basics of custody because we think we can capture more of the developing markets custody so its kind of a mix its got still some on to come but some of it embedded in our run rate today glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you for all the color operator well go next to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning everyone happy new year if i can circle if i actually start off on fee revenue outlook assumptions really just start on the fee waivers and just the trajectory of that emily just to clarify i think you said three rate hikes and the forward curve i think the guidance was as of december so im not sure if that forward curve emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp correct brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc sort of yeah right its like advancement of the curve expectations getting a little bit more aggressive in the market for fed hikes impact so maybe if you could just walk through the money market fee waiver trajectory through the year and really circling back to the portion that gets released after the first hike and then maybe after the second hike emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yep brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just on the equity market assumption equity market return assumptions within that market that market impact emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so a bunch there so let me take the waiver outlook first so remember waivers are a function of both balances also and rates and youre correct we are just looking at the and our guidance has baked in the forward curve with three rate hikes we have pointed out in the past that with the first 25basispoint hike we would expect to recoup about of the waivers the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 having said that we do also expect that balances to begin to decline a bit especially by call it the third or fourth hike so we do see some runoff in balances so when you put it all together we would expect money market fund waivers to be a little less than half of what they actually were in having said that its very important to note that as waivers dissipate we also do see a rise in distribution expense and thats been captured in the expense outlook to give you an idea just sorry brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc no go ahead emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp to answer this yeah to answer the second question which was more about sensitivity just i think something that would probably be helpful if we size the impact of both waivers and frankly nir if we had say a 50basis point hike in march versus a 25basispoint hike that would be about million more in recouping waivers than whats in our guidance and itd probably be about million more in nir so a total if the march hike was basis points not basis points itd be about another million more in terms of revenues versus what ive guided and then i think you had one more brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the equity market return assumptions within that of fee contribution from sort of markets emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so just to step back total fee revenue up roughly driven by the reduction of waivers roughly organic growth and then from marketdriven factors market appreciation is kind of a little over but its offset by lower fund fees and some currency headwinds just based on the average for fx rates over the course of brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it got it and then if i could just circle back on the nir deposit runoff assumptions in terms of the magnitude that youre expecting and then also just the assumptions for global shortterm rates i guess particularly in the uk and how that might influence the nir assumption emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so ultimately from a deposit perspective we dont really expect much runoff in deposits from here until kind of again third or fourth rate hike or the fed starts to actually tighten so its ultimately balances i mentioned have already come down a bit from average fourth quarter levels and in terms of betas in particular just speaking specifically about betas which is what i think youre probably getting at we do think theyll be largely in line with the past the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 like i said before maybe a little bit higher treasury services deposit balances are higher also just always keep in mind that our deposit base is largely institutional also in the period we were trying to come into compliance with slr so we were pushing some deposits off balance sheet but all of that is baked into the nir guide that we gave brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just the global rate like the bank of england assumptions for anything emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes its all the forward curve its all the forward curve brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc basically the same thing same thing okay great okay thank you so much operator we go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi betsy emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to follow up on that discussion we just had and ask about how youre thinking about the impact of qt quantitative tightening on deposits with the fed expected to shrink the balance sheet potentially starting as early as march thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes thanks betsy this is todd ill take this one right now it depends on when they actually start to actually shrink the balance sheet the guidance that weve heard is thats probably not an event until the second half and so thats the estimates that we have put in to both our the betas and the size of the balance sheets whether it be money market balances because it will certainly impact them or it is deposit balances the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 but assuming that they dont start really letting stuff run off until the second half of the year we dont see an enormous drawdown in the combination of money market balances because the feds balance sheet just isnt going to contract that much in we might see that a little more rapidly in unless they were to do something even more aggressive like selling so we took the basic assumptions market assumptions that weve seen and kind of thats implied in all of the guidance that emily just gave you which is a little bit of runoff of balance sheet of the fed balance sheet in the second half which starts to impact both deposits and money market balances as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so youre basically looking for the fed to stop buying but not actively shrink thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp i dont think theyll actively our estimate is that they wont actively sell but they will actively let maturities run off betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thats what in the estimate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right and then the followup question i had on the expense discussion just thinking about how to model the expense ratios by the new segments that youve got obviously the new segments are really helpful really appreciate you breaking out the wealth piece can you give us some sense as to how we should think about modeling that expense ratio in the various segments as we go through thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily you want to take that you may want to start with that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure sure so i mean ill just taking a step back first just the overall expenses up and just to be clear about or basis points are really revenuerelated and think volumerelated compensation as well as as i mentioned the distribution expenses that we will see an uptick in from money market funds as the waivers come back or as we get the dissipation i should say of waivers about another or basis points again is merit the normalization of business expenses and some also expenses just related to occupancy as we return to the office and baked in there too is inflation which is not insignificant and then the remaining or is due to higher investment spend but just to be clear half of that is annualizing investments that we have made in the second half of this year as you all know we had an uptick of the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 investments in the second half of this year i would think of it as were not breaking it down too much i would say that its a bit higher in ultimately in market and wealth services given some of the investments that were making especially in pershing x as todd alluded to but we are making investments across the firm so i would say a bit higher there and but the rest kind of in and around the average betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay so not that much differential outside of the call out on pershing emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah but i do think betsy we will see the operating margins in our securities servicing sic services business those are depressed right now i do think youll see those expand emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp both combination of greater efficiency and revenue mix betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay skewed to rates is also a little higher there thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp exactly the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we do i mean just further to todds point securities services the margins there are depressed theyre in a little over for the year and we do expect and i talked about this at the last conference i was at we do expect that to grow in excess of 30pluspercent over the medium term and as todd alluded to part of that is certainly profitable growth and of course efficiency and the other part of that is obviously just more normalized rates betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks so much todd and emily appreciate it thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks operator well go next to jim mitchell with seaport global securities jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning maybe just a followup on the expense question i guess this is about the second year in a row close to growth just how do you and i understand all the inflationary and other moving pieces but how do we think about longer term if youre doing organic growth hopefully doing better is the notion that you can get expense growth down to similar to the organic growth and then sort of market and other things drive sort of operating leverage or how do we think about the longterm trajectory of expenses relative to revenues emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i think youre getting at operating leverage and were always incredibly focused obviously on operating leverage and delivering positive operating leverage and next year we are expecting just based on my guidance to grow revenues more than were growing expenses so thats good and when we think about the future and just the expense spend we do see that ultimately moderating in and so youll see that coming down a bit in and and of course we have well continue to see an uptick in rates and higher nir well recoup probably the remainder of our waivers that plus the additional organic growth that we also will be delivering we feel pretty confident that well be delivering even higher operating leverage in but we are delivering positive operating leverage in jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners sure sure the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and let me i would add and let me add something to that were doing something thats a bit unusual for us for example with pershing x were making a very significant investment here thats probably got a twoyear payback weve also been continuously investing in resiliency and i think were getting were starting to get in front of that and the inflationary pressures hopefully this is just a onetime kind of stepup but those will have to the market will have to play itself out so we do think that were spending a little faster than we would in a more normal environment and we do expect that we will get more leverage out of our business model as we just continue to make it more scalable jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners right okay thats all very helpful and just as a followup if youre expecting deposits in the balance sheet to shrink as the fed raises rates why the need to issue preferred just flexibility im just trying to understand the preferred issuance emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure yeah just more flexibility we were also just opportunistic in terms of rates and ultimately too you have to prepare for if rates rise there obviously will be a corresponding impact on oci so all of those factors jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thanks operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes but theres some background noise mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc is that better the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay im going to just give what i think i heard you say then ill let you correct me what i think i heard you say is that this year is an investing year that youre guiding for organic fee growth or with markets versus expense growth of so it looks like youre spending about half of the benefits of the money market fee waivers to invest im not saying a cause and effect but thats the way the math works you said of that increase in spending relates to accelerated investments and then after this investing year and that moderates and then we should see more of those benefits so am i hearing that correctly and am i also interpreting that youre taking a portion of these benefits to reinvest back in the business especially in thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily you want to take it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike yeah ill take a stab at that i think what youre asking very specifically is what portion of the uptick from rates both in nir and recouping waivers are we kind of reinvesting i mean i think thats what youre getting at and i mean just to be clear and you can do the math i gave you the math that the higher rate environment both from an nir perspective and from a waiver perspective is a bit over call it million in revenues for the year with this forward curve et cetera the way i think about the expenses and what were kind of reinvesting of that and based upon the expense guide i gave you can also do the math that call it million to million of the expense growth is related to incremental investments net of efficiencies so call it or so of that is being reinvested mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess im just trying to reconcile when you said organic fee growth with expense growth some of that is just for factors outside of investing as you said inflation occupancy merit emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc revenuerelated so its just the cost of doing business the other question is why wouldnt the nii guide be higher assuming that the securities portfolio will remain flattish the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp i mean ultimately theres many factors that go into many factors that go into our nir guidance so its a mix of i suppose probably the main reason is deposits coming off a bit that would probably be the largest reason mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and are you being conservative thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike we do anticipate contraction of the balance sheet emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so its going to come from more shorterterm cash thats paying a little bit lower yields and i think your followup question is are we being conservative were trying to reflect what exactly the market is indicating through forward curves were not trying were not the guidance that weve given you isnt speculation its our its only speculation in the sense its the best estimate for betas and for whats going to happen to the yield curve using the forward yield curve as the guidance for it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah last one just the contraction of the balance sheet like by how much and i mean theres not much history for this right going to this phase of the rate situation so are you thinking a tenth a fifth or just roughly in broad terms how much contraction of the balance sheet and why thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily ill take that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp are you going to take it go ahead emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 i can take it yeah ultimately to be clear we did see just a reminder we did see balances already come down from fourth quarter averages we dont really attribute that to kind of runoff obviously from rates from rate rises its more about just elevated levels and market dynamics in the fourth quarter and then from here the way i kind of think about it is we probably wont see much more runoff until the second half so like i said its really after the fed really hikes a few times and id say kind of singledigit reduction mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp in this year yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc right right thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks mike operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning todd good morning emily thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc todd i want to come back to something you said in your prepared remarks that your new business wins i think you said are up from is that that seemed like a very strong number how does that compare to a prior from to maybe and second what were the main drivers was it better products better pricing your people are just hitting it harder can you give us some color on what drove that strong number the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so we had run for a couple of years there gerard we were literally running negative organic growth and so maybe four years ago i would be i would say some of the service levels werent up to par and we turned that around so we made a very significant investment in the quality of the service that were delivering we did make some we did provide some innovation with around our full bundle what we can deliver some of the connectivity that we made to some of the oms providers our data and analytics capability and most importantly the quality of our service in the asset servicing space and that became noticeable and both the combination of investing in technology and the quality of service that we delivered we started picking up some market share and so i would say that was the primary driver and its been a mantra here and in fact when emily was back in the asset servicing side she did a great job of putting together real analytics to support and understand exactly what was going on with our clients and adjust accordingly so i think its a combination of the two clients are going to be with you they expect that youre going to be investing for the long term that youve committed to it and weve demonstrated that and number two youve got to provide youve got to do the basics the meat and potato stuff for them as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and as a followup you guys gave obviously the outlook for which is much appreciated in that outlook you talked about the share repurchase or the total payout ratio approximating and is subject to changes in the aoci or maybe deposit balances on the aoci if i saw it correctly i may have not seen it correctly but it looked like it was a negative billion at the end of the fourth quarter can you share with us what drives that number and how it could affect the total payout ratio as the year progresses emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp go ahead emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp well i guess so thinking about just the payout and we can talk about aoci im not sure i recognize the number that youre talking about the billion but in any event we were fortunate obviously this year or i should say to be able to pay out obviously helped by the fact that we had excess capital limited by a lot of what we could do in and the first quarter of the guidance that were going to payout around of earnings is baked into that are aoci assumptions et cetera so its all there basically our capacity and the pace of the buyback is youre going to depend certainly on future earnings the economic outlook the size of the deposit base in any given quarter and what were expecting and youre right the trajectory of oci but all of that is baked into the guidance and the thing that frankly thats the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 nice is that for these days in terms of capital management were now under the scb framework so we certainly can be much more dynamic and flexible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see and just on the aoci emily what part of the yield curve has the biggest effect on your aoci the short end or the long end the middle emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the short end gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great appreciate it thank you operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning i just want a followup on balance sheet positioning to gerards question so youre at the lower end of that tier leverage ratio zone to that youve talked about and i just want to understand a little bit deeper that flexibility with regards to changes in oci versus prefs are you solving for at this point like how do you look at like where you want to be in that range and to your point about scb how important does maintaining the buyback be versus just staying in a right zone of capital thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i can take that and todd you can add so tier leverage this quarter as you guys can see the fourth quarter was if you really do the math which you all have the all of the factors to be able to do it yourself it was so we did dip into the buffer just a bit we always talked about the fact that that would be entirely appropriate given the excess liquidity in the system and the growth in our deposits so going forward were going to be managing to and were optimizing around a lot of different things including oci so baked into our guidance is the certainly our expectation that well be above ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so we consider all of those factors prefs oci balance sheet size and you kind of sit somewhere in that zone emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp you got it the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay all right and then second question just on that related point if i back out premium amortization it looks like the securities portfolio yield is kind of getting to a flat point and it looks like the mid can you talk about just what youre finding in terms of front book versus back book and again does that oci risk change your view of how youre investing in the securities portfolio from here thanks again emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay so a couple of different things there so look the talking about reinvestment yields we dont really disclose front book versus back book what i would say is that and this probably answers a bit of mikes question earlier which i hadnt thought about but reinvestment yields will still continue to be a bit of a headwind over the course of so the yield that were investing in now is still lower than ultimately securities that are maturing i think we would expect that to probably be a lot better matched or equally matched almost by the fourth quarter its really in the fourth quarter so that will still be a headwind and look were thinking about and certainly paying attention to oci and as i mentioned in my earlier remarks we did even move some hqla to htm exactly for that reason to preserve capital ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood okay thank you operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc had a followup so emily i think it seems like from your comments when you backed in the components of expense growth something like roughly percentage point of the is from the distribution side of the fee waivers number one if you could confirm that thats correct and then number two if we that means if we adjust for waivers because we all got very much used to adjusting for waivers from last year when you guys were talking about the revenue ex waivers and then wanting to drive more investment it looks like ex waivers were looking at negative operating leverage here because you back out the benefit from fee revenue youve got that gets you to fee revenue growth ex waivers the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 if im right on the youre at on expenses ex waivers and so its negative fee operating leverage given that last year we were adjusting for the waivers backing them out to consider where the fee operating leverage was why not maintain that same discipline now and whats the major issue with holding back that fee operating leverage thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so ill take that and todd if you want to add so youre thinking about the youre thinking about the expense the distribution expense largely in the right way and look your question about operating leverage is that our level of investment is not planned by nor dictated by operating leverage its based upon the investments that we see and the future growth of the company in terms of what you call fee operating leverage yes youre right in it will be negative but were not going to be apologetic about investing in the future of the company and weve continued to do that over the course of the cycle thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp i have nothing to add to that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc there we go all right thank you thanks for that color and then the assumptions around the singledigit decline in deposits are excess deposits still at to and when we start to cross the basis points of two three hikes where you start to see an acceleration of deposit runoff wouldnt that to of excess deposits burn off pretty quickly or do you have a different view or have the excess deposit levels changed maybe if you could add a little color around some of those assumptions to help us square that circle would be helpful thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i think your estimate of excess deposits is probably pretty close to what were currently thinking but you got to remember underneath it there is some organic growth as well so if you take the to and then youre growing to organically and then you dont look to see the fed really contracting their balance sheet very aggressively until later in this year we dont see a huge impact on this year its really going to depend around the beta so you might see money bouncing around based on what we and others are willing to actually pay for it so thats whats factored into it but ultimately i think those excess deposits will come down with mitigated somewhat by just normal growth brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thanks for taking my questions operator well go next to alex blostein with goldman sachs the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody just a couple of questions at this point i heard the discussion around deposit betas perhaps being slightly higher this time around because on the treasury services side of the business is there a way you can flesh it out a little bit more just to give us a sense of what you expect for deposit betas in the cycle versus the prior cycle emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah im not going to break it out by line of business but in the last cycle i think the first with the first basispoint hike it was about betas were about and in this were kind of expecting closer to like i guess to 40ishpercent and thats overall on average across all of our businesses alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay that probably explains some of the deltas people are asking about on nii so that helps emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc my followup just around capital management again thanks for the color around aoci sorry if i missed the dividend versus buyback expectations so as youre thinking forward within a payout ratio what are you guys thinking in terms of dividend growth versus the buyback and the preference there thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah ill go ahead weve been pretty consistent in targeting dividends around alex so i think probably you will see the adjustment come in the form of the buyback if there is one alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it yeah got it okay thanks very much operator well go next to thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp maybe time for one more question operator our final question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi thanks for squeezing me in here emily i just want i know you spoke about deposit beta assumptions underpinning the nii guidance you gave some color on deposit runoff i was hoping you could just provide some color specifically on what youre assuming in terms of noninterestbearing deposit declines and some deposit remixing over the course of the year emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so when we think about nib if you will we call noninterestbearing deposits we probably think we still have anywhere well actually sorry when you think about it and its actually disclosed so actually i can talk about real numbers i think net sic non interest deposits are close to 90orsobillion what youll see as deposits as rates hike what generally will happen is that they will some will roll off for sure but others will actually just kind of migrate into interestbearing deposits so all of that is baked into our guidance steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and do you have any specific assumptions you can provide just in terms of the absolute level of contraction youre contemplating thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp what weve seen historically emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah go ahead please thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp what weve seen historically through these cycles is were operating somewhere around of our total balance is noninterestbearing its a little bit tricky to pick up because of the us versus nonus but thats definitely very high because of the level of interest rates wed expect that to drop into the low something like that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats helpful color and then just for my followup i might be jumping the gun here but i wanted to see if you guys have done any preliminary work or analysis around basel iv and how that might impact minimum capital requirements i know you guys are constrained by leverage today theres some speculation that under the new capital regime the inclusion of operational risk in standardized in particular just given that its such a big piece of your overall rwa today could have a meaningful impact on overall capital requirements i know you dont have a proposal yet from the fed but even any preliminary thoughts around how youre handicapping that potential risk would be really helpful the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2022 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure i mean were obviously very involved with the conversation with the regulators and youre correct that the inclusion of operating risk will be a bit of a headwind in terms of capital but there are other factors that are coming off so netnet we think its going to be relatively will be relatively neutral steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats great thanks so much for taking my questions thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you steven operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call back over to todd with any additional or closing remarks thomas p gibbons chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp nothing to add thank you very much for your interest in the firm and you can follow up with marius and the team afterwards if there are any further questions thank you very much and have a good day emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator thank you this concludes todays conference call
